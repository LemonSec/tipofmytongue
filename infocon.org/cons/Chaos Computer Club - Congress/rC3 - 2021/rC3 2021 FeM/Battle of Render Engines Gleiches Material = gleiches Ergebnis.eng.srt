00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:02,470
Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,810
the film channel, the next speaker is

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,430
Franka, she dealt with computer graphics

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,230
and more precisely with the

5
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,389
representation of metallic surfaces

6
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:13,450
in various render engines after the

7
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,579
talk there will unfortunately be no T&M here in the

8
00:00:15,579 --> 00:00:17,380
stream, but there will be a breakout

9
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,720
Session in the AC3 forest and

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,820
in the missing MBS he is

11
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,590
clicked again displayed where exactly that is

12
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,630
also she is in the chat right now that

13
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,190
means if we were lucky she has time

14
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,980
there might also be answers for

15
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,140
the English speaking know that the OBI

16
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,929
in translation for to listen to select

17
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:37,570
the translation translated Stream in the

18
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,960
player and now have fun with the talk

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,100
[music]

20
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:02,559
and I previously studied

21
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,600


22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,860
audiovisual media for my bachelor's degree at the Stuttgart Media

23
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,079
University and the results of my

24
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:10,540
bachelor's thesis should be the subject of today's

25
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,549
lecture

26
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,909
the results were also already published in the

27
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,229
proceedings of the Skill i.e. the

28
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:19,450
study  1st conference of the Gesellschaft

29
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,979
für Informatik published this

30
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:23,140
year under the title

31
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,810
comparison of material models in modern

32
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,340
family based rendering pipeline

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,680
yes the first of the four races that

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,420
I have compared is the

35
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,159
Arnold renderer from the 3D

36
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,299
graphics software Maya Arnold is a couple of

37
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:43,570
spacers as well  with Chris from the

38
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,619
country and both pensioners are

39
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,109
offline Rennrades means it

40
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:52,140
takes a while before you even get a result

41
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,560
from him, so it does

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,979
n't work in real time, completely different from TV,

43
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:02,070
also from Blender

44
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,950
and the other Engine 4 that it avoids

45
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,190
realtime renderers, i.e. realtime renderers

46
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,239
Exactly and the Anvil Engine 4 is

47
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:15,879
also the only game engine here that

48
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,450
I have also examined

49
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,090
or yes yes

50
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,830
the categories in which the four

51
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,319
compete against each other are on the one hand

52
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,500
rossmist metallic madness and

53
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,629
change as well as clear-cut

54
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:35,799
yes you can already see that  the effect

55
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:37,840
of all a little I'll go back later

56
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,450
exactly  he goes into what the whole

57
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,840
thing means at all

58
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,940
why the whole thing is about 40

59
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,769
Kelly based rendering and or that

60
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:53,019
means the term means what you try to model the

61
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:54,510
real world

62
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,220
in the virtual one with the

63
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,909
help of

64
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:02,939
physical laws

65
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:05,980
and that had a background or  why

66
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,319
you do it at all is that it

67
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,890
ultimately simplifies the workflow 1 for the 1st

68
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,590
but why

69
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,310
didn't you do that earlier and ultimately

70
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,330


71
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,909
tried to model every phenomenon that you observed in the for the

72
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:24,790
specific case, so

73
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,000
you have highlights, for example

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,200
If you built a mechanism, you

75
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,159
can somehow adjust the gloss or

76
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,510
you also baked light and

77
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,470
shadow into the texture earlier,

78
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,489
but if you moved an object

79
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:41,500
in the scene or

80
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,209
a light there, you would of course have to

81
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:45,280
recalculate the whole scene and

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,650
the textures  So bake in 99 which

83
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,900
yes and thus the whole thing

84
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,640
pas a little more independently of each other  So based on

85
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,400
the scene structure, the placement of the

86
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,420
objects and the design of the

87
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,030
materials, a new

88
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,280
level of abstraction was introduced and the

89
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,530
whole thing implemented based on physical

90
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,879
laws or based on

91
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,400
physical laws.

92
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,390
Ultimately, this also led to

93
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,449
realistic race results,

94
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:18,160
especially if the

95
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,139
If the light situation changes unexpectedly then it

96
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:22,509
is no longer so easy

97
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:25,180
to somehow implement the whole thing by hand

98
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,190
,

99
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,229
but why now the comparison between

100
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:33,550
the whole randyrun?

101
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,810


102
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,630


103
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,050


104
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,070
others are

105
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,680
not possible and

106
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,350
the question is now

107
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,759
or or what you want is that you want to

108
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,430
have models that are as intuitive as possible

109
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,970
with which you can work well as an

110
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,910
artist, so I then

111
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,069
examined how and whether the

112
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,630
material models of the renderers

113
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,110
differ  and which model is

114
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,460
also more intuitive to use

115
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,580
yes so that it is a fair competition of

116
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,750
course also the same object must

117
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,410
be changed everywhere so

118
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,990
mapped i opted for a simple

119
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,020
convex sphere simple yes that

120
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,160
very simple cm firm

121
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,560
and also they come in two

122
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,210
different  lighting linaria

123
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,150
then go against each other that is on the one hand

124
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,610
a very natural lighting, i.e.

125
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,150
a simple directional light source

126
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,560
that finally does not exist in real life,

127
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,780
but nevertheless it

128
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,229
is very easy to implement and

129
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:51,690
that is why it is also included here with

130
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,800
its results, mainly

131
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,520
because it is waiting  will that in this

132
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,599
light situation all renderers

133
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:01,470
have to behave honestly

134
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,229
and on the other hand there is the natural

135
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:05,910
lighting

136
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,650
that is implemented you image based

137
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,270
lighting with four different

138
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,789
environment maps we don't have to say

139
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,030
that it's not

140
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,970
bad a few more pictures are coming soon

141
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,139
yes  I then evaluated the whole

142
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:22,120
thing by comparing the results in a

143
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,190
material table

144
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,810
and then comparing them quantitatively

145
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,449
and down here you can see the five

146
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:30,220
different lighting the

147
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,590
news that means on the far

148
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,840
left this very unnatural

149
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,210
lighting with only one direct but

150
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,479
light source like that  does not occur but

151
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,090
and next to it the various

152
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,360
his arias

153
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,560
that is in the background or also what

154
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,419
is meant here by noodler's golf and that's what is

155
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:52,440
meant here are the different 4

156
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,800
arenas, so to speak

157
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,259
yes in the end these are the images that

158
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:00,400
are used for the image-based lighting, i.e.

159
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,440
the background  which is

160
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,960
irradiated, so to speak, and then

161
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,210
throws the light onto the ball said

162
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,629
yes and since now all

163
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:15,599
would explain all the basics

164
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,169
if so say so here

165
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:21,789
are the results of the category what

166
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:23,580
is

167
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,199
so

168
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,639
first you might notice that is

169
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,199
not so much different than

170
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,550
expected  in the natural

171
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,020
lighting situation but auc  h in

172
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,180


173
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,349
others the results are very similar to roughness 1 me

174
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:36,599


175
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,000
what does ramez mean at all it is about

176
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,060
whether an object is very rough

177
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,650
yes yes has a smooth surface and

178
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,129
accordingly reflects light

179
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:50,009
very bundled or rather

180
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:54,210
broadly diversified and distributed

181
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,919
and

182
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,449
here you can see us at all

183
00:07:58,449 --> 00:07:59,770
So I proceeded in this

184
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,379
table of materials

185
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,509
I wrote a rendering framework for each renderer

186
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:06,550
because it is

187
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,379
more or less tailored to

188
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:10,949
the racing bike there isn't a

189
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,030
standardized interface yet it's

190
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,620
slowly coming to fruition, but

191
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,909
that's probably not the case yet

192
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:17,520
In

193
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,009
any case, I then increased the parameter value in

194
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,330
steps here with an increment

195
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:26,110
of 0.1,

196
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,009
this also applies to all other parameters

197
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,930
and

198
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,179
yes, then always made a picture here,

199
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,120
so to speak, and then compared the whole thing in the

200
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,390
table,

201
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,490
so from roughness to zero and  that

202
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,710
would mean a completely smooth object

203
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,570
so smooth that one h  Here the

204
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,760
highlight no longer looks a bit

205
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,190
resting = 1 that would be like saving the rough

206
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,510
object, so a Lambert is

207
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,350
material is also not important

208
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,620
and here you can also see in

209
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,450
a

210
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,650
material table with difference images

211
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,530
what changes between the third parties,

212
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:12,880
i.e. if  now Raßnitz is changed from 0.0 to 0.1

213
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,300
what changes if the

214
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,280
color is red it means that it

215
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,880
has become lighter zero is more or less white

216
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,920
remained the same

217
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,250
and should an area be colored blue it

218
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,200
means that it has become darker

219
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,080
compared to  previous is and

220
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,230
quite rightly I have shown again

221
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,170
wash before after = 1 against

222
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,020
water = 0

223
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,000
yes as you can see it

224
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,650
is mainly between the edges

225
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,280
cycles and Arnold in contrast to ivi

226
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,400
and Andrea to notice a difference

227
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,060
namely at the edge of the balls

228
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,230
and  especially also aside is again

229
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,450
so on the inner edge of the sphere namely

230
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,610
the terminator

231
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,070
which seems to be a special feature of the pass

232
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,770
trailer  to be

233
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,610
so my little bit difficult to say

234
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,610
but probably it is because

235
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,230
the effects are captured here in particular that

236
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,640
are captured better and

237
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,320
ultimately if you look at the two

238
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,570
here again in detail it

239
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:24,010
also shows that it is in the

240
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,420
right place in  also shown in

241
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,330
yellow at the edge of the sphere also

242
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,680
has an increase in brightness

243
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,120
so what I see is basically a

244
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,710
single part of the image plotted the

245
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,040
brightness values of the green channel the

246
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,540
green channel is more or less representative of

247
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,460
what we humans

248
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,620
perceive as brightness because the majority of

249
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,070
it  comes from the green channel

250
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,600
and

251
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,210
exactly this small increase at the end of the

252
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,940
sphere which is even brighter at the edge of the

253
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,230
sphere than in the middle of the

254
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:03,570
sphere this is called retro reflexivity

255
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,460
and that only models cycles

256
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,070
correctly so Arnold does

257
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,300
n't have it either and just like that  like the other

258
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,550
Rennerei also not displayed correctly

259
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,860
and

260
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,690
yes

261
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,670
also down here until  the glass which is

262
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,320
gray from Croatia is still shown

263
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,150
here it is the ball itself is a small

264
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,920
image section that is a little bit lucky

265
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,699
to show the

266
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,410
yacht that brings me something to the next

267
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,080
parameters I take with

268
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,760
Alex there are already larger differences,

269
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,340
especially if you look at the Rennerei the

270
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,500
Anvil Engine looks in comparison to

271
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,100
the other three

272
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,660
and here is the overview in

273
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,910
detail again because the one with an

274
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,810
wants is even more noticeable,

275
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,220
but if you look at what happens

276
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,150
from one step to the next

277
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,680
, it looks

278
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,120
pretty much the same for all Rainer Rahn  the picture shows that

279
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,520
the parameter is actually only

280
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,860
interpolated linearly, so I also

281
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,450
always

282
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:14,620
looked at the Immoscout implementation of all randyrun and

283
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,990
almost all of

284
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,960
them metallic actually only has the influence

285
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,190
between the non-metallic

286
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,930
and metallic linear interpolate state

287
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,310
and you can see that here  actually quite an

288
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,170


289
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,750
exception from

290
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,870
Anvil and also  I want to

291
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,300
plot another picture column from

292
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,920
a material that is

293
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,870
non-metallic on the left and metallic on the right.

294
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,620


295
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,820
Above all, I wanted to rule out

296
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,830
that I had made a mistake in

297
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,970
the implementation of the

298
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,940
lighting situation, which e.g.  Andreas wants

299
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,220
one a little darker on the front, yes it

300
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,340
is slightly darker, but

301
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,930
overall I would still say that

302
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,750
is good and what I

303
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,780
have matched to the others, nevertheless

304
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,590
, the difference between the

305
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,110
ladies in metallic is very big and

306
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,640
unfortunately I couldn't find out

307
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,130
why is that only that it was apparently in

308
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,540
my experiments at least

309
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,260
so the next parameter value bachelor

310
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,900
and the influence us bachelor is a

311
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,800
bit more subtle as you can see

312
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,000
with Arnold is almost not

313
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,510
like that with Vivian shows what is

314
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,550
changing again at the  Some [music] towards the edge,

315
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,160


316
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,190


317
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,600
yes, what you might notice is that

318
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,310
this highlight of this window,

319
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,670
these reflections are,

320
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,680
so to speak, in and out, so it

321
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,390
appears and is easily

322
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,300
faded out again and

323
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,770
in the end it is also what is

324
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,250
back in the power to be it

325
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,290
therefore in the three lower racing

326
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,990
bikes two christv and Andrea influenced specular

327
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,980
in Cern de  n refractive index in

328
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,540
Arnold, on the other hand, the whole thing

329
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,780
really works as a simple multiplayer, i.e.

330
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:09,340
as a simple value that is multiplied by the

331
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,110
actual brightness value of the

332
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,540
stop,

333
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,000
which means animals has the parameter of a

334
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,340
function other so fundamental other

335
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,800
functionality in the program and has

336
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,470
neuter although one  Of course,

337
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,480
when you put the programs in,

338
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,670
you don’t even know where you’re thinking, of

339
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,040
course, the same name and that

340
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,390
will probably have the same

341
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,840
influence, of course, that’s not the case

342
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,120
, you can see quite well here that the

343
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,700
difference in Arnold’s pictures is

344
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,400
getting darker and darker

345
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,180
towards the edge  towards the outside,

346
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,410
whereas the aside S&E,

347
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:51,000
especially at the edge, becomes

348
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,940
lighter the more you

349
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,860
increment the parameters Bachelor, i.e.

350
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,090
from 0 to 1,

351
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,040
yes, and that is probably also

352
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,310
the case again and because

353
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,670
the frenell effect has an influence, I

354
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,830
will now, however, in the context of this

355
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,510
Don't go into detail about the incident

356
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:17,380
a group, so to speak, that he is dealing with the

357
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,810
reflectivity, so to

358
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,880
speak, like a mirror on the edge of an object

359
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,830
and in the end it is of course

360
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,410
correct if

361
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,930
the light is then so from a physical

362
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,970
point of view, as far as I can judge, I

363
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,150
am of course not an expert in it,

364
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,500
yes, but  correct if the light is then

365
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,920
more strongly reflected

366
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,080
yes respect with the other

367
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,430
and the last category here click skin

368
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,080
also the effect it is again very

369
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,030
subtle in all fours guess this

370
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,670
look is still strongest in Arnolds where

371
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,140
we can see then maybe

372
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,050
hopefully you can see that the  other

373
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,460
things are getting darker the ball

374
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,930
if something shouldn’t have just been

375
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,090
seen you can definitely see them again

376
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,910
in the difference pictures

377
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,760
and yes

378
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,980
there is actually perfect

379
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,200
[music]

380
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,330
so you

381
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,590
might have to

382
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,750
explain

383
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,740
what clicker does at all  a difference between

384
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,470
klekot and roughness which is also very subtle

385
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,690
more or less than man

386
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,860
I have to look closely, at least in my

387
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,760
results, so it may well be

388
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,610
that the other scenes are better

389
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,410
visible or especially with

390
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:48,070
other object shapes, but here I

391
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,470
have brought examples to the far left

392
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,210
of the sphere where roughness is set to

393
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,460
0.2  the default value and

394
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,310
click skin to null null

395
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,170
if you now set klickaud from 00 to

396
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,740
10 then you can see that this

397
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,810
light so this orange highlight

398
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,790
still remains in the background can

399
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,270
be seen light

400
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,160
but instead connect brown

401
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,800
from 02 to zero one and  it rings at

402
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,369
00 in the right picture you have a similar

403
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,290
highlight but this this slightly

404
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,619
stupid background that is

405
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,209
blurred on the outside is missing

406
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:27,839
here and

407
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,640
that breaks up all the customers said in the

408
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,380
end that you apply a kind of second

409
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,960
layer to the material which

410
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,280
then again especially with the light

411
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,290
reacted more precisely I

412
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,310
could not find out about it but

413
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,050
that should be a sche  int be the effect and

414
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,090
the name itself is also very intuitive,

415
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,770
that's why I

416
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,380
always labeled the parameter as a tea intuitive,

417
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,960
even if the effect is very subtle,

418
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,870
yes that would be me, in

419
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,660
summary, just

420
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,310
not every racing bike next to the

421
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,170
supposedly same thing  The material was there right away

422
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,000
and supposedly that's why I

423
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,770
couldn't always

424
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:09,630
guarantee that

425
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,280
it really is exactly the

426
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,260
same material that I

427
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,240
've tinkered with in every race, but

428
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,700
I tried as best I could to set the

429
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,490
same values,

430
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,650
yes, especially

431
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:26,140
naturally  where the values were used, i.e. where the

432
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,640
same material parameter names were

433
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,830
used, I entered the same

434
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,920
value,

435
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,990
which in turn means that

436
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,000
I pose a problem for 3 3D

437
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,340
artists because the exchange of

438
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,410
such materials between the tours

439
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,500
among themselves is a game,

440
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,440
that is  you can't even do that

441
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,710
the cool shader from so shader  meant

442
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,600
in the end also in my in

443
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,420
contact now

444
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,370
material from Arnold over to the

445
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,320
other engine without

446
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,210
information being either lost or

447
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,390
wrongly interpreted

448
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,760
and the biggest why a

449
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,280
difference often still arises

450
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,830
through the hands technology

451
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,150
[music]

452
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,100
deductible  often the fit racers

453
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,530
then have a realistic

454
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,160
rest of the result, let me say the

455
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,360
real-time racing bikes, which

456
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,600
usually represent the whole thing in a simplified way

457
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,670
, maybe there will also be

458
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,200
some kind of standardized

459
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,880
material model in the future, I had

460
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,670
already seen work in the direction of

461
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,330
web-based representation  of materials

462
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,030
that would definitely be interesting

463
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,770
and what still needs to be taken into account

464
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,050


465
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,360
is that I have not systematically researched the influence of

466
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,960
algorithms

467
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,260


468
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,230
from formally transport i.e. raytracing path tracing restoration

469
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,260
and the selection of instructions maps

470
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,500
object form, of course  an influence

471
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,260
as well as the basic color so

472
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,170
that’s also called an albino of an object

473
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,560
and the texture

474
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,910
[music]

475
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,110
also could of course be

476
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:24,340
interesting how far and yes

477
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,900
the material parameters still influence each other

478
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,870
then actually it’s

479
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,460
what you do you take with scrap  Yes,

480
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,690
not just in one parameter

481
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,340
but in a large number of parameters

482
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,090
, of course, it would also be

483
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,280
exciting to examine other rendering tools such

484
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,240
as the game engine Unity or the

485
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,980
Godot Engine and,

486
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,120
in addition, the other

487
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,340
material models have anisotropic

488
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,060
material or transitive or  which

489
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,690
volume

490
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,160
scattering volume flow occurs subsurface

491
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,900
scattering is all the keyword

492
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,370
I could find examples and graphics here on the

493
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,040
project website

494
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,810
and here again the

495
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,470
publications on the lecture as well

496
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,600
as my references thank you

497
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,560
very much Franka an Wenn the

498
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,650
interesting lecture as already said

499
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,500
there is no Kirin here in the

500
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,880
stream but there is an airbag from

501
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,900
which in the AC3 world and it takes place

502
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,630
in the FEM assembly so that

503
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,070
should be displayed

504
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,130
soon right here

505
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,720
if you don't have a ticket you can

506
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,820
also use it directly  call

507
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,140
if you need it write again

508
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,900
in the chat then someone would have to post

509
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,450
right here in the fem can there be
