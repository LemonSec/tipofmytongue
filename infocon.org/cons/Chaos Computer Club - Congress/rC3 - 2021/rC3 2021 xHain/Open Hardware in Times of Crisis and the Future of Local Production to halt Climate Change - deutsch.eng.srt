so

27

28
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,930
or needs to be repaired then

29
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,129
we just work together like this I

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,430
would like everyone here to introduce themselves briefly

then we will  still nominate

00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,540
i want to focus on partner

179
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,850
one of the oldest or longest

180
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,630
contributors to this project was so how

181
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,150
was that for you

182
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,990
because hp is really

183
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,070
something other than

184
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,270
software we managed to establish this

185
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,870
collaboration

186
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:05,550
so i can tell you briefly about it

187
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:10,720
in 2017 when i was still at university  and

188
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,320
studied and

189
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,200
i

190
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,340


191
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,600
watched different organizations and

192
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,039
[music

193
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,970
] that the organization the

194
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,830
swan city truth is more software

195
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,340
based

196
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,530
and there was this sex project

197
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,430
[music]

198
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,760
that was run by the community

199
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,230
there but it only delivers

200
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,200


201
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,320
[music] very slowly  ]

202
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,620
then develop the project

203
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,860
further so that

204
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,270
mass production is possible

205
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,730
and that's when I came across the lab

206
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,130


207
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,400
android project

208
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,760
and that was in the context of google summer

209
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,120
of code

210
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:19,630
and after the project was

211
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,680
over we just talked about it okay

212
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,029
how can we continue it  what can that be

213
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:25,149


214
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:32,769
because it was a software program

215
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:35,839
i did my internship in signature

216
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,259


217
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:43,579
and a lot of people who are here in this

218
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:44,319
conference

219
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:46,550
video conference were also in

220
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,399
singapore and

221
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,949
we then discussed things how

222
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:54,110
the progress was

223
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,259
[music

224
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,000
] we looked at ok what

225
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,649
fits right now on the market

226
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,430
thanks a lot

227
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,610
i guess we don't have that much  time

228
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:18,050
to show all skills be sure to check out

229
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,300
the website ps

230
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,029
lab point

231
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:25,459
you can also produce the hardware

232
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:27,970
yourself if you want or

233
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,540
you can also order it online

234
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,680
you can do many experiments

235
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,758
control simple robots

236
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,959
and each sensor with

237
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:45,579
sqs

238
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:49,220
standard den  supports that can be

239
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,009
used with it

240
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:55,370
and this time we want more about the

241
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,350
story of how we produce this openness

242
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,670


243
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,390
and

244
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,390
that the strategy is that we just work

245
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,710
some code that we just

246
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,280
default use the cat but we will

247
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,900
actually produce the prototypes

248
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,970
so for general  prototypes or as a

249
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,560
way than six prototypes

250
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,520
so first one gets the

251
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,050
putting

252
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,660
the prototype together

253
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,400
and it's just not efficient if we just do it

254
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,610
ourselves

255
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,630
i can remember that

256
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,280
three to four prototypes were made

257
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,590
that was done with loeb in

258
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,580
which he killed

259
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,110
and that was just a lot of work

260
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,190
we had that too  lucky that we had

261
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:08,210
partners because the components were so

262
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,660
small and we did

263
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,430
n't have one, so not everyone could do something like that, it's a

264
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,209
small need

265
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,550
and i just supported the people with

266
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,930
my thoughts because i

267
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,790
couldn't solve it myself and

268
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,890
that was the question  how can

269
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,180
we then produce these things

270
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,130
and that was all only possible with meet

271
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,020
at offers joke maybe tell a bit

272
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,860
more about it

273
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,320
many challenges

274
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,320
talked about

275
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:57,119
or the quality control is

276
00:15:57,119 --> 00:16:01,679
everything of the two programs for us

277
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:05,139
and above all it was the first time that

278
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:08,279
we had done something like that

279
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,499
so we first thought about how we can get

280
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:13,569
in touch with them and china they

281
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:15,730
should produce it  we

282
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,040
looked at various websites but

283
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,269
there was the choice was

284
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:30,999
first thought about

285
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:35,489


286
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:39,179


287
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,329
getting the parts yourself and finding the manufacturer yourself luckily came the one who also produces all the circuit boards

288
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:48,929


289
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:56,009
and the value of the chinese new year

290
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:00,639
were all in china soon became on

291
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,679
vacation because of it  the situation was under a lot of

292
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,388
pressure so the manufacturers

293
00:17:04,388 --> 00:17:08,099
quickly closed in the middle so of

294
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,939
course we had to

295
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,000
inspect the fabbrica ourselves on site and carry out

296
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,020
the complete quality control

297
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,709


298
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:31,918
the problem

299
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,850
was that

300
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,660
some manufacturers had

301
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,970
sold used components,

302
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:46,750
which of course

303
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,800
would have affected the overall quality  where is the

304
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,720
budget number at the counter a

305
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,350
lot of

306
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,830
rejects it's different now but with third parties from

307
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,590


308
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,960
corona fortunately

309
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,730
our manufacturer doesn't stay we work a

310
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,630
lot

311
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,690
that has definitely become more

312
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,590
expensive what are now the different parts that are available to choose from

313
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:28,169
in the port

314
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:37,020
they are closed  we  rden

315
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,720
what the

316
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,520
siemens so the representation

317
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,870
so what says it took three months

318
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,379


319
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,050
now maybe is a change of

320
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,020
year or even three years later until

321
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,460
the complete ones are available again

322
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,850
this of course means that some

323
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,490
manufacturers put the components on hold

324
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,910


325
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:20,730
and the prices keep rising  on

326
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:25,320
an economic of the chips used

327
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,750
the pole the cost side costs now

328
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,640
you say dollars that is of course an

329
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,410
enormous price increase

330
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,040


331
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,210
but there are also problems what you find

332
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,580
a manufacturer

333
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,689
someone can work with and

334
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,610
what is itself are local production

335
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,860
concerns

336
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,200
what at the same time the event we are

337
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,790
still  not quite there

338
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,450
product defects are relatively small

339
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,990
that means the production is still

340
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,020
carried out in china

341
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,270
what are the challenges when

342
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,540
you talk to the wanted children

343
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,630
when we first as a trainer

344
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,480
i already asked

345
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,380
what can be said about it was

346
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,110
on the platform for the internet and  at

347
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,880
now  we are only allowed

348
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,100
to keep on this platform in english

349
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,500
in the cultivation is just for

350
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,970
international buyers so the

351

buyers based in china

352
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,090
go shopping alibaba and

353
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:57,280
compare prices so everything was in english

354
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,390
that can also be small and everything went

355
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,340
via

356
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,630
e-mail  and chat and also in English

outside of alibaba

00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,100
the knowledge asks information is

359
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,770
lost then in the communication

360
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,539
comments yes and then we

361
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:24,460
started to communicate on the other one

thoughts

368
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,010
I've been able to accommodate the defect and

369
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,710
when he said when we said rittner

370
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,789
then the service also ended on

the wii speak

372
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,440
and then it also comes with other

373
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,720
manufacturers like cinema or keep and

374
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,120
improve

375
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,720
the quality the provider was aware of that wanted to

376
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,120
stop again  you also

377
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:33,140
told us things have changed

378
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,159
our precedence  the important thing is that there were

379
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,730
already connections I

380
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,280
understand the processes better that in

381
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,470
itself is relatively clear when you do all this

382
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,850
for the first time is to produce something like

383
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,230
that then of course I was

00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,179
that was of course a big

00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:59,620
challenge for us

00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:03,710
than why can I just like that  this

with the production of clouded

and yes there was just a lack of chips and

465
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:32,430
that’s why  everything has been delayed

466
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,590
and that has not only affected the chips

simply affected a lot of things

472
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:52,000

plans publicly

474
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,730
so that

475
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,820
everyone can then just

476
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,360
do things themselves and of course you

477
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,150
can also do your own  adapting things

478
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,200
to one's own needs for

479
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,919
one's own dimensions

480
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:14,730
that's an advantage of open hardware

481
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:19,020
and now back to electronics

482
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,750
we're just very used to

483
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,220
sending the files, i.e. the schemes, back to china

484
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,679
and then it came

485
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,049
perfectly that the device was returned perfectly

486
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:35,950
but  under the corona crisis

487
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,340
that has stopped

00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,650
and

489
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,330
we thought to ourselves  it's just important

490
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,730
that you do

491
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,590
n't lose the skills and knowledge

496
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,929
that, it was important to us that we don't

497
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:01,080
just lose the ability

498
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,330
to produce globally, but that we

499
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,299
just take

500
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,980
alternative paths that you can

501
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,980
you can also produce smaller

quantities locally

503
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,700

504

production difficulties,

505
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:23,760

506
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,390
how can we

509
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,530
that help stop climate change

510
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:41,250

was it important to us that we could create

527
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:38,019
resilience for our community

528
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:40,860


529
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,000
of stability

530
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,069
[music]

531
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:49,539
and we just

532
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:52,629
used the materials that were available in our office

533
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:54,389


534
00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:56,889
and then

535
00:31:56,889 --> 00:31:59,919
we recycled a few things to then produce our

536
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,419
functional prototypes

537
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:04,980
and

538
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,419
In the corona crisis it was particularly

539
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:08,970
difficult to

540
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:13,259
show [music] in short pass lights.

541
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:17,139


542
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,990
What you can see

543
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:27,450
here is more of a local production

544
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,659
and production via the

545
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,519
community

546
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:36,419
can work

547
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,110
and

548
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:43,179
you can't even order devices like

549
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:44,889
medical equipment

550
00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:46,779
officially anymore  but

551
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:49,470
you have to produce them yourself

552
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,269
and

553
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:55,529
you have to produce that yourself

554
00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:58,840
and that's what I did

555
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,299
what happened here,

556
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:10,450
it

557
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:14,330
hit us when cockpit 2009/10 hit us

558
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,539


559
00:33:18,489 --> 00:33:21,529
, we couldn't just order buttons

560
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:24,279


561
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,090
and then quickly recruit

562
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,690
the community

563
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,690


564
00:33:39,129 --> 00:33:44,679
convened to start the face shield production of

565
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:48,129
the s  Elber to establish

566
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:52,359
and we were 100 volunteers

567
00:33:53,109 --> 00:33:56,479
and each of these volunteers could

568
00:33:56,479 --> 00:34:00,529
then produce 100 masks themselves

569
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:02,289


570
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:05,739
and the influence continued so the

571
00:34:05,739 --> 00:34:09,010
result was then 10,000 protective

572
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,599
shields that we produced

573
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,049
and

574
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,020
[music]

575
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,869
we then distributed them to areas with a high

576
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:23,359
risk  hospitals but

577
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,569
also food

578
00:34:25,569 --> 00:34:28,569
trade

579
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:34,790
and that was just a relatively small

580
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:37,480
project but it had a very high

581
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,849
impact and it was just a

582
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:43,720
community project

583
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:49,489
and it's not just about the fact that we

584
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:53,030
are somehow threatened by china china

585
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:57,040
but that we

586
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,770
are independent and

587
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,819
the question  is of course also when is

588
00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:03,619
the next one and they can

589
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:06,130
prepare us for it

590
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,260
and since we are of course also

591
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,280
energy efficiency, material efficiency is

592
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,809
important

593
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:19,069
if you use your own

594
00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:20,740


595
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,890
materials you

596
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:27,950
eat more you are not dependent on

597
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,319
external sources

598
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:33,670
and you also produce less waste

599
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,309
because the  normal way is actually

600
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:41,540
one best  ells everything from China and

601
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,450
then has it transported here

602
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:47,020
and that consumes a lot of energy

603
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,050
and yes, with something like that,

604
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:54,170
it also produces a lot of waste and the CO2

605
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,849
footprint isn’t that good either

606
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:07,960
and then you focus on

607
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,270
exactly when all the electronic

608
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,599
devices in the future are now

609
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,609
if you have a standard schema then you can use and divide them

610
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:18,190
more easily

611
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:21,109
for different purposes

612
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:23,680


613
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,670
and the question of it can we then

614
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:32,290


615
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,030
also

616
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,000
offer this open architecture to the industry so that they are

617
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,099
convinced

618
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,890
that they also use these open schemas

619
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,430


620
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,940
and i'll go back to that  mario well

621
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,190
i am

622
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,650
very impressed

623
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,140
he is a very big picture and we also

624
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,780
need such big visions in order

625
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,480
to

626
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,610
change and improve

627
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,890
that the industry is

628
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,630
developing

629
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,630
and

630
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,320
i would like to ask you again in terms of

631
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,880
sustainability

632
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,820


633
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,290
what advantages

634
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:31,230
do you see in the area of open hardware

635
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:37,000
in the  practical context what possible

636
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,420
do you see because

637
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:44,290
i f  I am very sorry that this

638
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:47,130
computer

639
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,330


640
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,810
magazine has published something about open source hardware.

641
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:56,760
I think this do it yourself approach

642
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,340
is a good and also a big thing, but

643
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,480
I also think it is important that you can

644
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,080
open your own device

645
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,050
and meanwhile there has also been a big

646
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,860
movement in  Germany

647
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:19,060
this rather this approach is

648
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,640
followed more strongly so do it yourself user

649
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,680
self

650
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,820
[music]

651
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,560
so that you can also repair the device

652
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,130
yourself and also exchange things with other people

653
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,700


654
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,060
and I think well

655
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,100
I think

656
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,290
it's we crank we just mostly

657
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,530
openness we would have

658
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,920
[  music]

659
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,110
because it would make everything a lot easier

660
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,810


661
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,100
, but now if someone has a

662
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,040
broken device and doesn't want to

663
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,060
use it

664
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:58,330
anymore, you can just pass it on and other

665
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,680
people fix it and bring it

666
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,630
back

667
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,380
so fix it again

668
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,660
[music]

669
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,310
and

670
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:11,170
I think stop  now there is a lot

671
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,010
more going on in germany

672
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,430
than ten years ago

673
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:20,740
and i think so

674
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,600
does it make sense to promote open hardware more at the political

675
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,430
level

676
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:29,260
as well so that it can

677
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,150
be found everywhere in the kitchen and

678
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,360
living room

679
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,410
and if i have the choice of course I

680
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:42,900
prefer to use the open devices

681
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,310
you also talked about

682
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,750
expandability and now we have

683
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:52,230
alexandrow  also in video chat and

684
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:56,470
we can support practically

685
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,740
every sensor that

686
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,660
supports the

687
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:05,250
13 3c interface

688
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:09,540
and alexandrow would like it with our kind,

689
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,460
so you are

690
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,700
working on an extension called

691
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,320
open spectrometer

692
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,030
and

693
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,740
i also think it's a good example like we

694
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,480
do  work together and how the whole

695
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,590


696
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:32,280


697
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:43,260
thing is also expandable tell us downhill to what i see is

698
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,580
that

699
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,490
it can also be used in a scientific environment

700
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,850


701
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:04,960
and reproducibility is also very

702
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,430
important to us in science

703
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,890
and the kiwis also said

704
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,210
it was very good we will just have a

705
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:19,380
real community

706
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,480
because

707
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,710
I share the repair unconditionally  but things are

708
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,239
easy to find or the

709
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:30,009
extensions aren't easy to find

710
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:31,859
and

711
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,960
we could then open the door to getting

712
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,309
more people to do

713
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:39,239
science

714
00:41:39,989 --> 00:41:41,579
and

715
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:44,910
visit the spectrum

716
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:49,109
spectrometer or spectr photometer

717
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:53,160
and with that device you can

718
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,019
determine how much of a chemical

719
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:59,499
components are in a sample

720
00:41:59,499 --> 00:42:01,890
and

721
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,799
you can use it to make various

722
00:42:07,799 --> 00:42:11,009
measurements

723
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:17,609
and

724
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:22,980
we have a very, very good sensor

725
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,859
that is very, very strong and it's not that

726
00:42:26,859 --> 00:42:30,009
easy to combine it with the pocket science lab

727
00:42:30,009 --> 00:42:33,640
, but it's optimistic because

728
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,369
there's a lot of

729
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:40,170
good potential  or

730
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,279
because it would bring a lot of advantages

731
00:42:42,279 --> 00:42:44,880


732
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:49,589
and I'm happy as I hope

733
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:51,690
that everything will work well

734
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,839


735
00:42:56,569 --> 00:43:01,190
because it will

736
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:06,349
allow people to carry out even more complicated experiments seeler

737
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:12,349
yes I think that's a short

738
00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:15,200
summary

739
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,609
and yes I always think it's great

740
00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:20,029
interesting if you if i come to

741
00:43:20,029 --> 00:43:23,579
you and you explain me  rt everything you can do

742
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:26,400
with this device, for

743
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,130
example, you can go to a

744
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:32,059
supermarket and then measure the food there

745
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:35,249
, you can give a few more

746
00:43:35,249 --> 00:43:36,799
examples,

747
00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:39,799


748
00:43:42,529 --> 00:43:46,319
so what we think of here for purposes of use

749
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:50,180
is that we

750
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:56,430
measure the colors of things and

751
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:59,839
then  draw conclusions

752
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,690
and if you break these colors down into a

753
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:06,950
rainbow

754
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:12,410
then you can

755
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:15,809
see you can see so again how

756
00:44:15,809 --> 00:44:17,220
the color is being fobbed off and these

757
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,160
colors of the rider scrolling

758
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,160
reflects what chemicals are in an e

759
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,598
food and from

760
00:44:26,779 --> 00:44:30,410
that we can also determine as hoped

761
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:34,460


762
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:37,789
So eating is concrete

763
00:44:37,789 --> 00:44:40,049
concrete fruit or vegetables and of course

764
00:44:40,049 --> 00:44:42,140
also the ripening status

765
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,279
depending on what the chemical

766
00:44:44,279 --> 00:44:47,450
composition is

767
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:55,099
and you can of course

768
00:44:55,099 --> 00:44:57,109
also what contamination is

769
00:44:57,109 --> 00:44:59,109
there

770
00:44:59,109 --> 00:45:04,519
so yes if a river is contaminated

771
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:06,470
it's okay what is that exactly what it

772
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,939
should be for  the now metal or

773
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,789
these are just uses that you

774
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:16,420
can do with it

775
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:25,700
and yes you can do tests with it

776
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,269
, including

777
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:32,379
testing the cupid after a curve,

778
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:42,549
so it's just a different

779
00:45:42,549 --> 00:45:45,499
machine than a unicycle from the

780
00:45:45,499 --> 00:45:46,930
machine we have

781
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,460
and there are many uses that you can do

782
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,809
with this spectrometer

783
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,119
and I hope so  ten look closer next year

784
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:01,119


785
00:46:11,859 --> 00:46:14,029
is it really true what's in

786
00:46:14,029 --> 00:46:17,200
there really what's in there understand what's on

787
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,549
it because now animals from the

788
00:46:19,549 --> 00:46:21,049
different knew that you can

789
00:46:21,049 --> 00:46:22,609
do everything with the updraft

790
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:24,890
spectrometer that's pretty cool of

791
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:29,529
course because we also want

792
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,030
that one spectrometer that you just

793
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:35,590


794
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:38,700
you can get a spectrometer for less than 100 euros that is of course great here

795
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:43,090
then for all the details as an answer I

796
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:45,700
should definitely keep my own people

797
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,800
informed about what is such a big topic for him

798
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,190
the

799
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,080
workers are not many hours but only

800
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,780
a few

801
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,880
minutes I would also like to know about that  talk about

802
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,820
how we managed

803
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,500
to get through this crisis by focusing on

804
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,070
different parts of kon  have centered

805
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:08,010
and have ensured that kessler is

806
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:11,500
better expandable the 15 software have

807
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,770
completely concentrated

808
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:17,640
than others here has found

809
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,260
the field who has joined

810
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,000
and

811
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,980
could you explain a little more what

812
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,140
progress we have made, for

813
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:30,060
example in the area of satellites and e.g.

814
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,430
with the

815
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:35,190


816
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:38,550


817
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,860
oberliga  interesting times covered by the

818
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,030
software and had survived

819
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:52,500
we already have some of the further

820
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,500
endangered

821
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,780
[music]

822
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,340
different

823
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:03,300
so each component of this protocol

824
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,960
communicates the

825
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,730
beast signs

826
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:15,330
that in one part

827
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:18,210
there are however

828
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:21,130
you can drivers corresponding

829
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:24,270
licenses for many

830
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,130
components

831
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:29,640
and many of these

832
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,770
whether it  it is possible

833
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:38,730
to reuse this driver to

834
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:42,329
switch taxpayers that was project this summer

835
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:46,070
that was successful

836
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:49,070
and

837
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,810
manage the 1 about it the forest

838
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:00,109
sent

839
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:06,869
that only a few below 1 300 fits for a short time

840
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:08,700
so you don't have to

841
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,500
overdo it a

842
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,500
bit

843
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:38,670
should you really do it s  the use of the tick

844
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:41,240


845
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:45,770
here is to be established

846
00:49:46,099 --> 00:49:49,500
so it also has something to do on the one hand

847
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,250
because

848
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,150
support has been

849
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:11,960
implemented for expensive that means

850
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:19,140
if a driver is in the 200 that means

851
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,319
because here

852
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:23,640
you wanted we could use

853
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,160
drivers to

854
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,510
make these changes in place

855
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:29,940


856
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:33,990
other  features

857
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:38,440
that we get through the

858
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,089
placement of siegburg that is not finished yet

859
00:50:40,089 --> 00:50:40,680
but

860
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:44,700
is still being worked on

861
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:02,829
so the bag has that and it's great

862
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:05,520
to see this progress

863
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,569
i don't want to print

864
00:51:07,569 --> 00:51:09,420
the goal for

865
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:13,800
and the topic of climate change

866
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,200
that more sustainable what

867
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,799
the  production

868
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:26,980
what exactly are the use cases of

869
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:30,460
our hardware project wiki

870
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:35,079
first to be saved than

871
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:37,329
to develop new technologies or to

872
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:39,849
stop climate change from the

873

okay there is a question

885
00:53:04,589 --> 00:53:07,390
i found the ipad and the first

886
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:09,270
question is

887
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,800


888
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,800
where can people learn more about this project

889
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,660
than asking for a link

890
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:25,410
so that link is  it

891
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,950
you can just look at it

892
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:33,868
and that's exactly what it is

893
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,990
and it's slowly getting to the end

894
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:40,050
i feel a bit

895
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,570
bad because

898
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:51,150
don't have that much time

899
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:54,490

everyone

908
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:21,839
and with our hardware this is possible

909
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:32,140
we are not starting any specific

910
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:37,130
projects right now so climate change is a

911
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:40,190
huge huge problem

912
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:43,450
and it is a  massive problem

913
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,480
and i think an essential step

914
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,210
for

918
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:00,220
i didn't understand the rest

919
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,660
yes exactly you have to understand the world around you

920
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:05,060
to also solve the problem

921

that surrounds you thanks alex

922
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:13,000

924
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:26,020

to

928
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:37,160
share the course and know what

929
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,600

so daniel do you want to say

933
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,780


934
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,940
something briefly about the community and the

935
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,220
development in the last few minutes?

936

00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:21,790
also need a lot of energy and inspiration

946
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:35,240

are doing here

forming a community,

951
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,050
working together and

952
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:53,860
sharing resources,

953
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:01,640
and I would like to appeal that

954
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,960
we need more people who are committed to open

955
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,210
hardware, whether that is the right to

956
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:11,890
repair it,

957
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:18,220
I have known you for a few years now

958
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,380
and

959
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,530
and i

960
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,840
'm always positively

961
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,950
surprised by what we

962
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:32,390
can achieve in this team and that's just so

963
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:34,430
many people who are committed

964
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:38,200


965
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:40,940

967
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:54,880
by coming together, that you

968
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,150
can create good things

969
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:02,230
and also inspire

970
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:12,040
people  it also occurred to me briefly

971
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,530
that you understand things

972
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:21,140
it really helps if more people

973
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,690
understand what's happening in the world what's

974
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:26,590
happening in the world

975
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,960
and other things basically every

976
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,140
kind of thing

977
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:36,590
and because the rocket science lab is

978
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:39,670
also on a rake

979
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,860
fully understand  can how the

980
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,850
electronic circuit works

981
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:54,010
and you can of course do this  he also

982
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:55,810
transfers it to other electrical

983
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:58,450
devices because the whole thing is not

984
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:01,630
specific to our devices or our

985
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:04,120
project, but because you

986
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,910
can learn general things and

987
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,860
if you have a new device that breaks

988
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:10,960
, you can possibly use yours and

989
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,280
know that you can help  our sap device

990
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,840
can use to integrate other devices

991
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,300


992
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,980
but

993
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,910
that but it is still so

994
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:25,960
decide that you have an

995
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,270
open

996

the different components

999
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,640
play together and

1000
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:49,480
and you can get a good

1001
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,990
understanding

1002
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:54,060
of them

1003
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,670
increase electronics

1004
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:58,900
you can of course also connect the
