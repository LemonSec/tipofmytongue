an export is it it's the open

3
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:12,820
hardware happy but now it's being made by

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,119
several people and i

5
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:17,320

so daniel you are the moderator do you

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,190
just have an ok well yes thank you very much that

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,120
we can meet here

15
00:00:42,749 --> 00:00:45,640
we have been thinking about starting

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,149
a series of events again

17
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,850
and although we do it every month and we

18
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,789
want between virtual meetings like

19
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:56,010
now

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,120
change and maybe also physical

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,789


22
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,269
happy hour meetings and

23
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:05,980
we still want them that’s possible with corona

24
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,260
and stuff like that and we thought it might

25
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,270
be nice if we had a

26
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,080
round of introductions other

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,600
i’m daniel i work for the open

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,760
knowledge foundation

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,690
together with max and we’re working

30
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,270
on  prototypes

31
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,610
for us funding by coty padberg and

32
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,040
we had met in

33
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,180
german before and

34
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,730
we ha  ben together on next where

35
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,000
we work

36
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,340
together with companies and

37
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,750
want to build openness and

38
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,610
now everyone can just say

39
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,170
what connections they have to open

40
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,420
hardware and we are in different

41
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,830
places everywhere maybe we can also

42
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,200
say where they handed over the next ones since and then

43
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,740
and

44
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,310
from medium to okay i'm helli

45
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,890
and

46
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,568
maybe you can get me out of the

47
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:11,150
internet and others maybe fight me

48
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,010
out of the hacker scene in

49
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,040
berlin and elsewhere and i live

50
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,440
in portland now and

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,800
i'm

52
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,680


53
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,900


54
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,520
fix we did the first hardware power in berlin and we  there are a lot of faces here that

55
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,920
are capable of seeing

56
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,860
well-known faces and what do I do with

57
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,320
open source hardware. Everything I do

58
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,690
is

59
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,700
communicated in every possible way and in every

60
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,540
country

61
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,040


62
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,290


63
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,630
sharing resources and

64
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,360
sharing technology and it's a

65
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,290
larger philosophical movement

66
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,680
more i towards more openness

67
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,540
and

68
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,340
i work myself i build musical

69
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,220
instruments for example and

70
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,329
experiment with different

71
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:15,680
materials and i work for crm

72
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,799
supply that is an american company that

73
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,900
makes electronics and everything we

74
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,070
do is open hardware and yes that

75
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,750
is it and

76
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,970
with it

77
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,750


78
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,640
has already worked together with many other projects and there are also

79
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,310
many

80
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,560
interesting projects

81
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,049
with german hackers now and i

82
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:44,420
make open source hardware and i also help

83
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,980
other people to develop open source hardware

84
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,269
and i'm

85
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:52,390

maximilian yes thank you

88
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,590
i am happy that i

89
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,020
can be here and daniel has already said something

90
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,410
and

91
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,380
italy has said we work together we support

92
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,380


93
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,440
the financing of open

94
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,230
hardware and i think that

95
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,548
is something that is important and has

96
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:21,988
to be supported and  deserves more attention

97
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:25,530
and my background is i

98
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,560
also sth  As a philosophical

99
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,610
me a few years

100
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,700


101
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,250


102
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,230
ago, I was very interested in the philosophy of technology and open workshops, hecker spaces

103
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,440
and so on and I am on the board of

104
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,600
the

105
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,090
network of open workshops and that

106
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,180
is my connection to all of this and of

107
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,890
course open hardware  is very

108
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:53,900
important

109
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,390
and a very important movement when it

110
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,820
comes to

111
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,340
the society

112
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,130
in which we

113
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,960


114
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,560
take care of normal things and that we conserve our resources

115
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,690
and all these things that

116
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,370
are really important at the moment and

117
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,130
transparency and that interests me

118
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,710
very much  me very much and i'm

119
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,380
glad to talk to you guys here

120
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,500
and i don't know if he's there i

121
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,870
can't see him

122
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,330
maybe there is yes he is on the

123
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,610
left side

124
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:40,310
of the screen with yes yes yes

125
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,540
ok yes hello I'm with and i  sitting

126
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,580
here in echsheim in berlin and live and

127
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,570
well this is happening

128
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,010
all over the world during this phase  are and like

129
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,570
everyone else I've been working with open

130
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,490
hardware for a

131
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,570
long time and what didn't bring about it

132
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,270
, what got me

133
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,890
around is, so to speak, a

134
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,800
key fob that turns off all the televisions

135
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,510
in public spaces that's

136
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,320
called tv and yes, like everything

137
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,490
else  what i have done is

138
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,270
that open but well i think it is

139
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,390
open how do you earn money with it and the

140
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,430
only dances reason why i

141
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,110
could live from it is now after ten

142
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,590
years or like some friends of mine who have

143
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,240
also been able to live from it for the last 18

144
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,910
years  is because it is open and

145
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,120
there are a lot of reasons for it and

146
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,100
the biggest thing is when it is open then

147
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,770
there are a lot of people who help and

148
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,570
not me and not just me and my

149
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,280
little brain my little brain

150
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,220
often still works quite well but when

151
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,890
we have a lot of people working together

152
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,660
then we have a lot of people who

153
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,610
work

154
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,320
together most of the time and together we have something that is a lot bigger

155
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,560
than you could do on your own and

156
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,580
if you do these people are constantly talking

157
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,350
about it with other people about this

158
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,020
project and that's what I would otherwise never

159
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,820
be able to do not just a

160
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,620
small company would have yes and I think we have a

161
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,530
chance of surviving than as  pcs

162
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,860
then is a big part of it because we have

163
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,110
open projects that exist

164
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,410
because people find it useful

165
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,530
many people find it useful

166
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,330
then they do it because it is

167
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,680
worth working for it and not

168
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,180
just maximizing profit

169
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,390
big companies and then the software  is

170
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,300
in this downward spiral in the bus

171
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,320
going down in the middle environment and with the

172
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,780
economy and

173
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,690
with the economy and maybe

174
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,660
we'll talk about it today it's

175
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,300
your turn

176
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,690
thank you yes that's difficult when it

177
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,469
's your turn

178
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,820
i'm a systems engineering system

179
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,710


180
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,350
engineer  of school and i have been trying to get out of

181
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,690
this industry and

182
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,880
hopefully

183
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,680
there are some options around the academic

184
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,050
scope  eld and i'm experimenting with it and

185
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,600
i see where it takes me and yes my

186
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,910
background is music and

187
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,290
i dived right into this

188
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,620
hardware world because i wanted to understand

189
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,340
how how to get my own

190
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,190
machines running and yes

191
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,049
i did  looked at it and gotten

192
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,260
involved after ten years of engineering

193
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,020
and i've had to work with

194
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,150
artists and have made

195
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,670
interactive

196
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,870
[music]

197
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,120
interactive systems and i do

198
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,190
n't know what where i don't know what's

199
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,360
happening and control visualization and

200
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,140
and and that got me to  reverse

201
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,950
engineering brought can we

202
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,320
i can build my own sensors

203
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,330
and

204
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:19,050
yes and the question why do we want to

205
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,380
open everything we do is i

206
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,030
have a personal life

207
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,590
story and grew up in this hippie commune

208
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,300
where everything was shared with

209
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,000
everything that was just never a question  and

210
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,910
so i grew up

211
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,700
in this industrial hardware world

212
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,940
and hyperspace was easy  h that's the

213
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,280
most suitable

214
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,470
way to spread and share ideas and technology so

215
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,760
that we can all continue to grow

216
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,380
together yes that's my motivation

217
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,730
and maybe i can

218
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,180
tell you a bit more about it later thanks

219
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,630
it should return the microphone yes

220
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,940
unfortunately three people are missing today  here who

221
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,720
should also be there otherwise and so

222
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,410
unfortunately couldn't be there and but I

223
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,910
think we can maybe also

224
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,040
really it makes sense it would make sense

225
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,370
to ask each other questions

226
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,440
because we all certainly have too

227
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,020
much to share

228
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,020
and

229
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,530
if instrument a question  but did

230
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,040
something

231
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,810
and but I don't want an expert but I

232
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,610
'm married and we talk about it

233
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,350
often and I

234
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,170
already know roughly what almost happens with

235
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,750
open processors and I can't

236
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,730
tell you a little bit about it

237
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,810
yes and that's totally interesting  Yes, it's

238
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,700
super cool and you can also deal

239
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,960
with it yourself for those who haven't

240
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,830
yet  know there is someone who is called

241
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,530
individually and i think that watching some of

242
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,990
his lectures

243
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,520
at the congress must be very

244
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,250
interesting at all install at

245
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,740
the congress and when injured in

246
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,810
a space bahn we were able

247
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,270
to talk about it but it is  it's been a few

248
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,520
years and the project has

249
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,760
evolved and

250
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,320
when we talk about open hardware

251
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,240
we often talk about physical

252
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,450
devices the circuit board the end product what

253
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,870
we have like the example a baby gone

254
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,560
or a synthesizer

255
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,670
another common example that the end

256
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,170
product but what we  what we really

257
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,780
want to look at from hardware at

258
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,550
open source silicon is

259
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,950
we look at the processes how can

260
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,470
we open all the way down so

261
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,760
one is if you open the board files

262
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,560
but if you can't make

263
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,920
it how do we get the knowledge distributed about it

264
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,270
how to make these boards and

265
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,830
if we go further down then

266
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,750
we can ask ourselves w  how does a

267
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,880
transistor work how can under the topic

268
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,350
how can a chip be made and

269
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,120
if we look at it closely,

270
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,450
this knowledge is very strong in a few

271
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,580
people artificially sets up the

272
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,410
file design files but the whole

273
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,690
physical processes are

274
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,810
not transparent at all and  all

275
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,800
all dependent there comes a couple of

276
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,780
big companies who have this knowledge

277
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,980
and we explained a chip

278
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,650
problems so that the whole whole

279
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,140
manufacturing have on these single

280
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,300
devices then it's not just a

281
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,220
physical

282
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,060
problem but also a logistical

283
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,230
problem how can we

284
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,610
manufacture things  which we can't get

285
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:48,110
anymore and google and apple is that

286
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,360
one company

287
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,180
it's all second hand know

288
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,090
i got my picture of eva beuys did he

289
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,030
also work on it and is a reporter

290
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,620
people at google they

291
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,420
worked together to have an

292
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,350
open sourced in guide  go all the

293
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,790
way down that means we can do

294
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,860
it in the open  it produces silicone we

295
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,990
have a process that we is

296
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,820
repeatable we have a way

297
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,830
people can learn tricks and is the

298
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,900
process the second one goes on the background

299
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,240
but probably open in a

300
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,290
very interesting place

301
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,890
currently schleiz if you make a

302
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,200
chip then that's it  there are some

303
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,620
parallels is that

304
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,600
anyone can get their chips made for free not just

305
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,350
academics or just chip

306
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,340
professionals properly but also hobbyists

307
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,460
can get their chips made for

308
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,800
free the only answer is that it has

309
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,620
to be us open source and i

310
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,750
guess that if your interested  have a

311
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,920
bit of an advantage

312
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,710
probably won't be a problem for you

313
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,320
and even if you don't know anything about making

314
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,910
my chips there is

315
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,170
a great guide it says 0 to

316
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,480
date legal that says vw

317
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,090
is able to make their own chips

318
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,980
and if they have  us a a

319
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,200
discussion about open silicone that must

320
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,790
now  happen because there are

321
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,560
currently so many exciting things happening in this

322
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,510
area and if anyone is

323
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,590
interested in making a chip

324
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,060
go to

325
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,440
theology now menzel i don’t know exactly

326
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,870
and

327
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,710
i’ll spice up the ko and

328
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,090
he’s not the only person there

329
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,800
are very  a lot of people who work

330
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,470
with him he has a lot of good

331
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,400
lectures about and now because we could

332
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,470
still take a hand you can

333
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,930
now produce your own

334
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,120
chips and do it open source

335
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,640
and a part of this whole

336
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,280
thing down to the open transistors

337
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,710
do that in my

338
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,000
knowledge i have only read articles about it

339
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,850
and so i am i have

340
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,200
not produced a chip myself but i have

341
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,260
now heard lectures about it thats

342
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,930
my summary i am sorry if

343
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,910
i did either was i hope

344
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,850
that he has a

345
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,290
bit some ideas  what you took away from it

346
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,800
were these ob silikon silikon projects, they

347
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,330
are very important and i

348
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,250
want them au  I'm

349
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,860
connected to the way we work in the software

350
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,710
world

351
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,570
[music]

352
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,570
there

353
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,710
's something about econique that's right everywhere

354
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,000
because we can use some of the

355
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,050
functionality is out of the

356
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,390
functionality behind even in

357
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,650
these situations

358
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,810
but what's still a problem is

359
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,350
itself in the area of open hardware

360
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,570
and that is a question that we

361
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,139
should have

362
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:02,440
to ask

363
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,480
which situation is in which is

364
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,699
it necessary for me hardware necessary

365
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:11,930
if we collect money now, for example,

366
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,779


367
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:16,779
which

368
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,320
open source hardware is nothing that

369
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,910
I am in itself makes sense so

370
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,740
Technology is always connected to a big

371
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,440
goal and that is also something that

372
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,360


373
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,220


374
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,510


375
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,240


376
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,180


377
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,980


378
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,540
is open source  to make it

379
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,670
like i'm trying to think if people

380
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,170
really want to see what's in the

381
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,760
hardware  t then when it find out

382
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,309
there is no problem there is no

383
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:07,000
valid reason is not so

384
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
but

385
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:12,549
[music]

386
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:16,790
when we hear the question i

387
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,439
want to answer seriously maybe with

388
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:21,290
safety or self the things where it where

389
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,809
it is needed most but for

390
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,579
everyone else  reasons is

391
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:28,179
everything should actually be open source

392
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:31,179
yes

393
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,180
i'm on the other hand

394
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,380
i'm a pragmatic and i

395
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,270
understand that we don't live in den

396
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,460
inselsberg as soon as

397
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,610
we would like to we still

398
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,830
have to exist as a

399
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,700
society and

400
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,310
we still have to pay our

401
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:58,670
rent  pay and we make open

402
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,400
hardware because we don't force

403
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,500
everyone to make standard open

404
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,470
hardware choices we try to meet them

405
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,420
where they are and take them a step

406
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,100
further if they show their voice

407
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,720
ticks then your

408
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,220
firmware version also shows we then have the

409
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,780
question why  do you publish your

410
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,230
non-european citizen ports and

411
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,240
then you have to move them step by step in the

412
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,210
direction of ö  openings

413
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,920
win

414
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,620
shows us what you do you

415
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,800
have to be pragmatic you shouldn't

416
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,300
yell at people because they have a different

417
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,930
opinion but yes i am also

418
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,050
a lifter yes

419
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:44,860
but i am also a gripping

420
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,300
yes i know that pushing the other

421
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,190
direction is also because  Yes, I think the

422
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,200
other way around and I think that's

423
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,470
still not really helping

424
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,020
to keep something klosters and then you

425
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,150
can just

426
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,780
take it with you and throw it further

427
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,980
maybe then I'll now do the same

428
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,850
with them this ideal but

429
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,480


430
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,840
want to have a really world open hardware the  politicians

431
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,120
want to get them to join in

432
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,700
then we need a strategy we

433
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,000
need good arguments how this open

434
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,260
hardware idea can work

435
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,400
in capitalist society where

436
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,470
many things

437
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,630
still need these business concepts and

438
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,150
where open hardware is a part of it

439
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,100
that's why it's a difficult question

440
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,200
and this one  ask also always connected with

441
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,890
specific problems

442
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,260
and now ask  t me if it

443
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,080
is something that it shouldn't be or

444
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,780
not but is there anything

445
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,960


446
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,020
we had on this site when it comes to

447
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,900
art for example

448
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,820
then it's nice that there are some that are

449
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,400
just special and that's what

450
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,670
he did  are and it's ok

451
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,570
they are what they are

452
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,759
[music]

453
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,820
yes and i have one more question about

454
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,450
you i would like to talk to and that's a

455
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,780
question i'm

456
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,820
really really concerned

457
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:40,290
about how the open technology like

458
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,290
we support the people who  on a

459
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,630
hardware and software we're going to

460
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,700
help live and there are so many in the

461
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,820
open source space that would work in burnout

462
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,920
and the

463
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,300
industry you could make a

464
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,310
lot more money and that's

465
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,100
really a question and a problem that

466
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,770
really bothers me how help  we

467
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,070
people who work in this way and

468
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,650
that they can really make a living from

469
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,030
it we should help them to

470
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:13,530
make products or finance a pajun

471
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,760
that means we  do we support these

472
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,130
people like john and all these

473
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,090
things

474
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,909
that revolve around you being good at doing

475
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:22,799
good marketing yourself and that

476
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,360
's really hard is really

477
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,340
difficult how can we help

478
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,200
them help the people who do open source

479
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,679
so they can pay their rent  and

480
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:34,799
to inspire someone like that, for example,

481
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,130
there are many examples of

482
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,080
how people do it is it just a

483
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,860
hobby or

484
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,090
can you earn something with it how do you

485
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,980
survive if you work on a

486
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,350
project and would I have

487
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,549
been invested in shares earlier about that

488
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:54,890
i think along with you

489
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,720
i can maybe say something about that

490
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,390
, i.e. i was so happy that i was

491
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,669
able to do this project, that it

492
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,100
somehow got

493
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:09,000
the ear of the media

494
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,490
and the media love stories

495
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,370
like that i did what makes

496
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,440
tv public spaces

497
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,270
and those were them  media great

498
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,370
and

499
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,020
as soon as that was available and the

500
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,450
media pounced on it and that has m  a

501
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,850
life improved and i've been able to make a

502
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,460
living from it so far that means not everyone is

503
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,159
so lucky that they have a

504
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,049
project like this that

505
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:36,630
markets itself and is bright and like i

506
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,539
said it's really important to

507
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:44,240
talk about it and and if you want to make a living from it

508
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,890
a good example might be as an

509
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,169
artist if you want to live as an artist

510
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:52,289
then you not only have to

511
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,899
make art that means

512
00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:57,059
something that burns in you and what you

513
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:00,980
have to show the world, but you

514
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,520
also have to be able to do it  and

515
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,470
similar to a software or electronics

516
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,720
project or any project you

517
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,169
have to have the possibility that burns within us

518
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:15,720
that we want to show the world because we

519
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,029
because we have to do it

520
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,399
otherwise we have to fight against ourselves and

521
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,159
that's there you just have to ask yourself  who

522
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:26,039
then loses but you also

523
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,190
have to have the opportunity

524
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:31,350
to be able to show the project to the world it

525
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,450
would show and that's completely different

526
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,919
fert  things and skills that you

527
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,289
need now you have to deal with accounting

528
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:39,330
and taxes you have to run

529
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,190
a small business you have to

530
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,039
prokop have permanent employees and who should

531
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:46,110
i hire and see maybe

532
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,110
even fired running a business that

533
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,659
fits completely different things and all of these

534
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:53,669
really doing stuff with it teaching viewers

535
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:55,020
and learning how to do all this

536
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,940
stuff its not easy at all

537
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,940
and it's very stressful but

538
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,919
something if it really is what's

539
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,169
burning what you're burning for and

540
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:06,330
needs to get out then it is then it's worth

541
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,880
doing though  there is no easy answer to

542
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,789
that because i think one of the

543
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:13,590
just important things is that you have a

544
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,690
community have some team

545
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,260
that you find part time to do that

546
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,140
to find out what is important to you

547
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,780
and for each individual that means

548
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,270
we don't necessarily know yet when  we

549
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,690
only went to school or up to the age of

550
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,559
16 or

551
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:36,649
however long and then

552
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:39,840
some said  t have but the school system

553
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,020
drives out creativity by decree but

554
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,120
we have to figure out what something

555
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,889
means to us and if we can do that in a

556
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:49,409
community then it's a lot

557
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:51,899
easier and better than doing it for

558
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:53,940
ourselves and

559
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,799
that brings us back to being more open  hardware

560
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,770
and open

561
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:01,380
source it's again a big community

562
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,620
more eyes more brains that look at

563
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,260
something and improve it and then

564
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,809
we can do something much better in

565
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:12,120
a community than we can

566
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,950
do alone in general and if there is a

567
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,399
community of them

568
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:19,470
really  this project what means what you

569
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,090
do then we might want to

570
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,460
help some too and some might be

571
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,919
good at designing a logo

572
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,870
or maybe give you

573
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,029
an idea that can take it to a new

574
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,529
level then you never thought of

575
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,230
and people know them

576
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,770
maybe help with the beech attitude or knows

577
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,500
someone who can do that life

578
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,480
who like to do it and maybe there are

579
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,300
people who are good at running small businesses that

580
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,550
will give you ideas and

581
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,190
i had to learn it all myself

582
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,520
because tbb ghosn suddenly became a

583
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,559
huge hit overnight i had to learn all that

584
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,390
and i was lucky that

585
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,190
i  I could do all that but also that I had a

586
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,380
lot of friends who were really

587
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,840
good at doing these things at

588
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,640
a time when I really needed it

589
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,790
and there was a lot of luck that I've

590
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:11,150
had in my life and that means

591
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,250
there is no

592
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,470
magic and no  magical answer

593
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,960
that fits everything

594
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,390
very abstract in abstract answer

595
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,280
is maybe the key for

596
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,800
all for all of us in all our

597
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,100
projects

598
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,200
yes

599
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,120
because it is connected to the question

600
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,620
first on the internet i just wanted to say

601
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,200
there are examples i don't know exactly

602
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,600
if they

603
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,090
a good life has had a stressful

604
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:50,960
life but lukas from berlin eg

605
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,710
who made this notebook

606
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,630
except for open hardware

607
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:03,040
and if someone asks if we

608
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,240
can bind someone who has done

609
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,740
what on a piece of hardware that

610
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,640
is, for example, an

611
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:14,059
un-reform many portraits in berlin and

612
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:15,740
he has a very stressful life

613
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,380
i think he designed this notebook because he had to do

614
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,410
all these things himself

615
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,809
do with a small team and they

616
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,110
only had a very small production in

617
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,330
his office

618
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:32,530
and they made it possible with this

619
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:35,270
with with internet funding with crowd

620
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,370
funding and

621
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,880
there are other examples

622
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,070
of yes but then we come back to

623
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,240
the problem of

624
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:49,230
and well that  is maybe a completely

625
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:49,909
different

626
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:53,220
topic a different topic know fleetingly

627
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,390
but also saw this color of this question

628
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,799
and i have a good answer

629
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,340
maybe there are craig gadgets that do

630
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,340
really great work and they

631
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,880
make tools and peter estes is in

632
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,090
someone else and he is  behind

633
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,309
various open source projects and

634
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:13,220
the keys is really interesting and

635
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,010
has an interesting business model

636
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,530
he does

637
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,659
streaming and also does real

638
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,370
hardware and that's really

639
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:27,320
interesting peter first krestel gadgets

640
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,240
lukas and team ans klo is a fool

641
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,880
really interesting and he's a

642
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,240
hardware designer and

643
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,990
design products and i don't know lukas

644
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,070
wilk similar to the project not enough

645
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,270
but there is the  systems on site

646
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,309
with a marino in a domino form

647
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:50,100
factor a fixed board there are a

648
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,390
lot of people who do interesting

649
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,620
things and of

650
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,549
course we released ad designs and yes

651
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:02,400
park driving sees studio in china the

652
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,270
website is yes yes yes i don't know if

653
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:09,120
there is much that is open  does but some of them

654
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,280
are really open i think and they

655
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,659
do a lot in that area a

656
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:19,490
lot before the sg a year hopefully it's

657
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,270
totally

658
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,990
crazy there would be all these things

659
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,720
would like to see the extent of the whole world

660
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,929
coming in we should have 90 to 95

661
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:36,470
percent back

662
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,059
I can't send many people away and I do

663
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:43,230
n't have to, but we have to see what work

664
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,270
people need  ten everywhere and isn't that

665
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,720
great to see what's available on

666
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,600
a piece of hardware for str

667
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,760
and that totally follows everyone is

668
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,210
crazy about sdh and there are still a lot of

669
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:59,720
things in the pipeline and I

670
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,580
'm not really excited about this new chip idea

671
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:06,580
I think it's okay I wonder

672
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,289
I think people should waste their time

673
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:10,370
on things that aren't

674
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:11,650


675
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:16,669
realistic well what we wouldn't take any products

676
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:19,070
that haven't completed a prototype

677
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,080
yet that means everything else

678
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,460
would be gone

679
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,039
that means we have to make sure

680
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,570
they have a really working

681
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,450
have prototypes

682
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:32,450
that's okay yeah yeah first of all show us

683
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:37,210
that it's possible yes and

684
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,840
yes there are a lot of people just saying here

685
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,450
do crowdfunding from my nephew

686
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,220
factory and

687
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:50,210
and no we do electronics yes and yes

688
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,419
there is a big project we should

689
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:55,880
maybe do too  talk about tesla open

690
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,820
hardware only partially only

691
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,679
partially the batteries

692
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:05,360
batteries charging technology is open source

693
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,850
but much different  s is not open source

694
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,179
and that is proprietary will be tried it will be

695
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:13,669
kept because from your point of view you have

696
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:14,919
all these things

697
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:16,450
that have to

698
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,559
meet safety standards and

699
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,030
you don't want people

700
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,760
to build things according to your design

701
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,159
and then be responsible for them

702
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:28,340
yes I don't know why  they do

703
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,250
it but i didn't know that either yes

704
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,730
i know the one who started tesla motors

705
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,960
and that's not this one

706
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,030
is not the type everyone knows today

707
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,940
yes who really counts on him life

708
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,100
so my girlfriend started

709
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,220
it before anyone could  which

710
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:50,000
we don't talk about and nowhere had

711
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,929
there been fights with the one about whom little is said

712
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:57,230
and at least had

713
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,830
calmed down again and

714
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,049
and

715
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:02,640
if you really want to start a car company

716
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,789
that competes with general motors

717
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:07,710
and other big

718
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,690
car companies how do you even do something like that

719
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,789
and he wanted  that things are open

720
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:16,919
but he didn't want to be

721
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:18,330
responsible for the thing then  en who couldn’t destroy the company in the end

722
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:21,840
yes ok yes

723
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,630
how

724
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,850
then do you become something like that at

725
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:30,769
all the legal protection and

726
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,779
is there a how to

727
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:38,220
protect yourself from liability problems and something

728
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,200
how much does how did you do that

729
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,600
with did you  there were problems you had

730
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,630
problems in that area yes i started

731
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,549
interestingly deep is

732
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:50,010
completely on the songs but there was

733
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,649
someone who stole it and that was

734
00:32:52,649 --> 00:32:54,110
a former customer

735
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:57,090
so it was the one who stole it was no

736
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:00,720
longer a customer but suddenly there were

737
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,000
things like that  looked like deep started

738
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,940
his terms but with another

739
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,000
box with my name on it and

740
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
i have quite a few fans and when you go open

741
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,919
source then there are people who

742
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,010
care about you and from which he within

743
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,240
an hour and a half i had

744
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,639
some 100 e-  mails or something like that what's

745
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:22,679
this here that's you apparently not

746
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,380
what's happened so far it's as if I

747
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,500
called my ex customer

748
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,559
and what would be our the  price wasn't

749
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,200
good enough as well a bit closer

750
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,669
and they actually

751
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:38,070
did it badly they put my name and

752
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,470
trade mark on the

753
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,750
box and that's why i had to

754
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,470


755
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,419
sue them to stop them because that was really

756
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,850
bad product and i wanted mine

757
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,830
names don't give my name for

758
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,019
their product that would destroy the product

759
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:54,059
because yes i bought a couple of

760
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,039
them and a third of them did

761
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,960
n't work and

762
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,779
they didn't work well and

763
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:01,559
everything they should have done

764
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,600
just copy my little ones they

765
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,269
just  free were under net had useful

766
00:34:06,269 --> 00:34:09,000
product but they wanted

767
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,969
more and didn't know anything

768
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:12,770
approaching and

769
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:15,619
made bad products to this level luckily my

770
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:17,869
brother is a lawyer and he loves

771
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:20,330
what he does and he recommended someone

772
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,070
in the uk where this horrible

773
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,159
company was around  to help me who also

774
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:28,429
likes his job and they gave me

775
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:31,010
go  olfen and that's going to be quite stressful

776
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,260
and it cost me quite a bit because in

777
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,570
the uk if you

778
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:40,599
want to stop court

779
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:44,500


780
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,909


781
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:50,500
cases like this it's very difficult to get your own costs back

782
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,489
even if you're 100 per cent

783
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:54,679
right and the judge says yes 100

784
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,869
per cent right  and normally

785
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:58,790
you get maybe 65 per cent of

786
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:02,150
your home back properly at most that means

787
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,940
i lost 65,000 pounds in the

788
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:08,020
process and that was quite a bit of money and

789
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,430
i lost real money for a year and a half

790
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,650
before i was able to

791
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,450
actually make money from my product and that

792
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,940
was quite  stressful but we live in

793
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,210
a world in which

794
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,550
the whole of capitalism

795
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,160
and capitalism can make people and

796
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,200
money if they want and also with

797
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,839
court cases and also in the open

798
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,260
source projects cloud because they believe

799
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,099
they can he wants to earn a quick

800
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,920
dollar and  these people

801
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,750
have done it and inzw  nically

802
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,280
they are no longer in business and

803
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,500
that backfired

804
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,990
and that means we really

805
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,510
can't prevent it from happening,

806
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,940
but if we

807
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,130
bring it into the world with a really good conscience in the

808
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,980
context of testing and we believe then they

809
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,869
are  chances are much higher that it

810
00:35:56,869 --> 00:35:58,760
really works for us there are

811
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,240
no guarantees of course but

812
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,580
especially now when we do open source

813
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,920
projects and then we do it

814
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,560
and in good conscience and people want

815
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,290
to help us more than they would much rather

816
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,089
help than a proprietary product

817
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,580
and  there are lawyers who

818
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,250
also help us and some would even have to

819
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,660
do it pro bono if there is an

820
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,000
open project in a city he is

821
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,299
cooperating in a project and

822
00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:30,460
that is good for us at the moment

823
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,720
it is a good transfer for the

824
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,960
real-time the buttons

825
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,420
in china  were that the industry

826
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,599
learned with the whole

827
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,819
world china has very flexible

828
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:56,799
copy protection law or copier law  t

829
00:36:56,799 --> 00:37:00,950
ask yes because the culture of open

830
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:03,710
hard even within europe

831
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:06,460
to the usa is a huge difference

832
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,559
different reasons and children is

833
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:12,319
another completely different project

834
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:15,079
disappeared again with stade and i

835
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:17,359
just got out of his technical

836
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,770
knockout always but i am  still

837
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,920
there but i heard what he is talking about

838
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,730
rail is a very interesting

839
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:28,609


840
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:30,380
topic at i will be at the prepared talk

841
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,980
about mythologies about china just before our talk and it was

842
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,329
a very interesting talk

843
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:37,720
we will be able to look at it again

844
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,970
china is a very

845
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:43,819
very mixed thing  but if anything

846
00:37:43,819 --> 00:37:45,950
does with electronics then you

847
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,339
probably have to interact in china

848
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:51,529
at least for part

849
00:37:51,529 --> 00:37:55,089
that is where the complete

850
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:58,010
preparation is wrong if it

851
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,680
deserves to be made there as

852
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,049
many of the parts are made nearby or

853
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:05,660
even in china  which ones are

854
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,579
resold they are made in

855
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:10,160
china  ellt and whose resources

856
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,270
are there are in china

857
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:16,369
is a good example making the temptation as

858
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:18,279
soon as

859
00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:21,079
possible this is your case the

860
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:23,369
united states of course china

861
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,499
it is that the

862
00:38:25,499 --> 00:38:27,349
capitalist one can imagine if the

863
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:31,730
mythology is quite different but

864
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:36,089
if  people want to make money there

865
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:38,400
because capitalism is the values that as

866
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,920
any kind as possible that there are

867
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,990
many people who only care about

868
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,880
how they can make money and i like

869
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,400
them make money like it's good that

870
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,109
is when we in china  makes things so

871
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:50,609
that somewhere in the world it must be

872
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:53,099
important that you look at yourself,

873
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:55,680
talk to people and if it is possible

874
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,970
to make sense of someone

875
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:03,900
visiting then be clear that they

876
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,309
have told you what they think what you

877
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:07,410
hear  I want that's not all yes you

878
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:10,230
can do it remotely in the project but it's

879
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,450
much better if you meet if

880
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,170
you recognize people's body language

881
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:18,269
and draw  t how friendly they

882
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:20,279
are and how to trust each other and

883
00:39:20,279 --> 00:39:22,650
if there is a misunderstanding and

884
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,390
there always will be misunderstandings

885
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,849
via email or whatever then when we

886
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:29,519
meet the person of nancy there must be a

887
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:32,279
reason he misunderstood that

888
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:35,960
now a lot  it's easier to clean up

889
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:41,609
the small projects like spear way

890
00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:44,400
or chelsea pcb use all the

891
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,440
other big ones and that's relatively cheap

892
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,170
to start our projects on it

893
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,210
and that's pretty cheap it was

894
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,920
actually the time but when we leave the

895
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,259
house and say there are good

896
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:57,900
manufacturers i have  have one that i've been working with since

897
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,569
2005 - and

898
00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:03,440
super league have helped each other so much

899
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,640
if you make a mistake then admit

900
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,910
it and a few companies

901
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,180
don't do something and

902
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,629
are also very happy

903
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,490


904
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,470
to support people with their open hardware projects even if  it's just small

905
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,549
amounts are very very big experiences

906
00:40:22,549 --> 00:40:25,170
situation and a lot of what he's

907
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,440
learned is by giving me g  we

908
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,030
helped and we learned together that

909
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,780
means if you have a project that

910
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,660
could possibly be helped by a real

911
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,319
manufacturer in china I

912
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:43,940


913
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,460
trust you could borrow more money then it

914
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,690
might work but you should

915
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,670
always ask two of the three companies

916
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,950
just to see if  that is

917
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,650
realistic while

918
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,569
you are the ones that are best for you because the

919
00:40:57,569 --> 00:40:59,789
manufacturer because you have me is actually

920
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:02,039
not a legal partner at all is

921
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:04,289
this part of your life everything

922
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:05,809
you do is

923
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:08,180
something

924
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,309
you do you have to pay for but the

925
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:15,079
interesting  in china all this has

926
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,039


927
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:21,960
happened she is on relationships even if it is

928
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,270
capitalism and people

929
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:27,410
can make money in any possible way if

930
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,789
it is legally possible the

931
00:41:29,789 --> 00:41:31,640
relationships are very

932
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,289
very important and worth a lot that

933
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:38,130
means if you have to give up a relationship

934
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:41,279
the middle is built  have for

935
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:43,559
days or weeks or months then

936
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:45,599
don't just do it for a

937
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,250
bit  money over most many

938
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,660
will some will but many

939
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,420
will not do it because the relationship is

940
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,160
important who knows where that might be in the future

941
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,609
not quite but

942
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:58,130
the connecting

943
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:00,510
connects with new people the relationship

944
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,630
is the action with my producer

945
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,910
that a relationship that me  important is important to you

946
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,950
is important means that i

947
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:10,589
have recommended people to you and a few

948
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:12,990
of these connections he has

949
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:16,170
now led to you making ten million ten

950
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,630
million us dollars that

951
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,859
is a great deal because of these

952
00:42:21,859 --> 00:42:24,990
valuable relationships

953
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,900
that you have built up there  just because

954
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,880


955
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,740
if you copy a few things a little bit

956
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,030
that

957
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:38,540
would destroy a lot of relationships that

958
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,840
's just a toolbox that we

959
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,160
all need to have if we want from our

960
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,810
projects besides that's not

961
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:48,090
necessarily easy i would

962
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:50,310
always recommend people both to

963
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:52,520
try that  we

964
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,700
all live here because we do things

965
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,920
that we w  important are we do

966
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,680
n't just love having my normal job

967
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,500


968
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,800
we hope there's

969
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,450
money that we can make a living from it

970
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,180
and

971
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,340
to have more than one head and then

972
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,630
hopefully have enough time to do

973
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,610
important projects is so let's just

974
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,200
do philipp part are you also a

975
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,600
elected and maybe you can

976
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,369


977
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:25,230
introduce yourself and then we

978
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:29,000
can talk for a short day at all a

979
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,260
little climate and at advent in the

980
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,680
area yes it should be nice now with

981
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,460

session there are

983
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:45,150
good reasons to be around  to see in

984
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:48,750
good because i counted the time such a

985
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,700
difference and i thought

986
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,030
the session would start at 16 and 16 minutes

987
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:57,330
so i'm totally late

988
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:00,240
so i'm sorry i'm really that

995
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:18,530
but i

996

1004
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:42,330
tropen hardware and i have

1005
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:45,530
been working on free software for a while and

1006
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:49,280
i am a software of forum brasil

1007

active already  for a while and

1008
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,710
am currently interested have a new

1009
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:57,810
project in alaska and am trying to bring open

1010
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:59,150
hardware

1011
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,800
scientific open hardware

1012
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,660
elements how do we get open

1013
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:07,670
hardware to climate research and

1014
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:13,820
we can share more hardware because

1015
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:18,590
research use you can

1016
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,020
create community science for me with

1017
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:25,170
open hardware you have  even with

1018
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:27,330
open software we already do that

1019
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:30,000
is an important component that we have to

1020
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,200
discuss but i wo

1021
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,690
n't talk any more here now, we

1022
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,940
can go to china and then we can

1023
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,210
continue to talk about

1024
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,860
a weaker climate topic what a great connection

1025
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,230
we can do this

1026
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:49,860
you're talking about clone  projects and I

1027
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,790
believe that  If there's a way there's a

1028
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:55,740
hedge on this clown hat

1029
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,800
then we give them these bad

1030
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,070
ideas or a real idea pulls

1031
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:03,330
specific hardware that could be used for other

1032
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:04,860
things and they can

1033
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,060
say 'oh I can make a lot of money with

1034
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,270
this and you  will repeat the project

1035
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:11,730
and it will be even cheaper

1036
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,640
, that means everyone

1037
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,780
gets it maybe we

1038
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,820
can somehow build a hat away from it

1039
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,060


1040
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:24,220
yes i was in a hacker in residence

1041
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,960
in zagreb in croatia radio

1042
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,710
and they had an idea that they just

1043
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,720
said it for 1 of your projects

1044
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,230
it's an open hat the

1045
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:40,289
bgh didn't want you to have you did

1046
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:42,849
n't have a budget for example you

1047
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:44,130
didn't want to bring your life to

1048
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:48,369
create a budget to create his

1049
00:46:48,369 --> 00:46:50,170
company produce the whole

1050
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:52,140
thing what you wanted to do  was

1051
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,279
they wanting to do the kickstarter

1052
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:56,109
project or some other kind of shorts

1053
00:46:56,109 --> 00:46:57,730
haus thing that looks like a

1054
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:00,369
super awesome thing  than any other

1055
00:47:00,369 --> 00:47:03,099
company in china is just copied and

1056
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:04,900
distributed all over the world

1057
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,380
then they have to make themselves

1058
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:08,069
[music]

1059
00:47:08,069 --> 00:47:10,749
i don't know if they made it real

1060
00:47:10,749 --> 00:47:12,970
but i saw your project the

1061
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:16,440
circuit boards on ebay

1062
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,509
i could see that since last  four

1063
00:47:19,509 --> 00:47:20,890
years ago and i saw that

1064
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:23,069
and you are still working on the project

1065
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:26,309
years later and

1066
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:29,200
things like that happen in the world

1067
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,099
we can have super

1068
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:35,339
strong and complex projects talks about it

1069
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:40,049
with very cheap hardware and

1070
00:47:40,049 --> 00:47:43,539
minister ways gives these things to the

1071
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:44,759
world

1072
00:47:44,759 --> 00:47:49,349
many people can benefit from

1073
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:54,730
whether source hardware in a

1074
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:57,720
scientific context is very interesting because

1075
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,100
i would also like to ask how i can

1076
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,380
start business maybe a

1077
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,950
little more specifically i

1078
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,170
wanted to ask with my question from the beginning is

1079
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:11,850
there is there

1080
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,130
is there something where we  being able to say that

1081
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:17,020
is public interest technology

1082
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,610
technology that has to be open

1083
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:23,130
and

1084
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:25,890
because  she has

1085
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:29,710
a goal that helps everyone in a

1086
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:31,300
community it's not about a toaster it's not about

1087
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,320
a toaster but

1088
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,500
and if we're now targeting mischa and

1089
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,470
then who that is there are things but i

1090
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:42,820
don't know yet what you

1091
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,280
think about it

1092
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,750
yes i think that's very important i

1093
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:49,440
already have  had a similar question

1094
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,090


1095
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:54,480
heard that here teaches

1096
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,110
you so many

1097
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:00,670
scientific tools that

1098
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:03,990
are coming now and i think that's very very

1099
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:06,160
nice because i think that not knowing

1100
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,410
an important part of open hardware

1101
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:09,570
because for

1102
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:13,170
us it's an important part for me

1103
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:16,450
that we have tools flops  1 got and

1104
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:18,160
what you said to maximilian how you

1105
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,520
idea that there is technology that is in the

1106
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,760
public interest and should therefore

1107
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,640
not be shared that is very

1108
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,620
interesting and interesting discussions so far

1109
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,460
question

1110
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,800
what is your opinion on it

1111
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:42,190
one that is so much in motion it

1112
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:43,780
is like that  a lot of people coming from

1113
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,340
hardware that

1114
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,840
scientists learning those skills where come

1115
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,370
what  are these for people in this open

1116
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:52,130
science who has

1117
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:55,130
society

1118
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:59,040
yes and with the many possibilities

1119
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,470
we have of training and on

1120
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:04,550
hardware and free and open source

1121
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:08,790
and community communities but

1122
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:11,550
if it is about open

1123
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,340
science then i believe that it is a very

1124
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:17,250
diverse community and there are people

1125
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:20,820
who are just interested in

1126
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,150
publishing and

1127
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:25,470
need a public release platform and

1128
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:27,300
there are people who really

1129
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,360
want to build software for reproducible

1130
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,480
workflows and here they are building the hardware

1131
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,180
and for us that's pretty new to

1132
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,590
this community but it's very,

1133
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:39,780
very exciting  and very exciting we

1134
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,850
come from different parts of the

1135
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:44,370
world and we are really interested in the

1136
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:46,920
state of science with

1137
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,410
collecting intellectual property and

1138
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:54,270
we need to change science

1139
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:56,370
know the way science is done

1140
00:50:56,370 --> 00:51:01,520
to make it more inclusive and more

1141
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,410
so that more people participate

1142
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:08,480
can and is it g  there are

1143
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,300
big companies that really have

1144
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,980
n't had anything to do with openness up

1145
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:17,430
until now and are now trying to

1146
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:20,250
call themselves open and support open

1147
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:24,960
access and yes and it's a

1148
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,540
complicated

1149
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:29,400
section and I think there's a

1150
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,090
lot we have to do to

1151
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:35,610
find open hardware

1152
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:37,650
want to bring about a kind of open science and

1153
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:39,450
i think we are not quite

1154
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:41,820
there yet i think there is still a lot of work to be done that

1155
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,130
would be my personal impression of the

1156
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:48,380
state of open science

1157
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,180
yes and i have the feeling that in

1158
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,520
germany or europe we now have the

1159
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,610
chance  have really been out there

1160
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:59,200
and working with public

1161
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,080
money also there is a new

1162
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:06,040
government now and things are happening they have

1163
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,620
that on their agenda as well and

1164
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,690
there is some movement in the right

1165
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:14,410
direction but i would like to know from

1166
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:16,840
a us centric perspective is

1167
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,180
there  there are similar things that can be followed

1168
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,790
in the public funding

1169
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:24,190
of open hardware or  he's that's

1170
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:26,590
that's impossible i wouldn't say it

1171
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:29,080
's impossible but it's really

1172
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:32,020
difficult to sell that in the usa

1173
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,270
there's a long history that if

1174
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:36,250
i make something cool happen then

1175
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:39,190
we have to get together with people and do it

1176
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,510
ourselves and we leave  we

1177
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:41,920
don't care about the government that's for

1178
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,620
sure and for example after the second world war

1179
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,330
the united states

1180
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:51,160
paid for the government of course

1181
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,010
because of the motivation to have the economic

1182
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:55,540
control that you have the wrong

1183
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:59,950
reasons but as a result there

1184
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:03,610
is a culture here that  you think the

1185
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:06,250
government should pay for it i

1186
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,600
mean why do we have the government if

1187
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,790
they don't give us something in return

1188
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:12,580
for the power they gave the world

1189
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:15,360
cup but in the united states there

1190
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,850
is a

1191
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:21,520
right to repair movement and there are

1192
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,540
eg logos man who has a lot  videos

1193
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:28,030
makes these incredible videos will make

1194
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:30,850
the past years

1195
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:32,920
you can fix the impossible too

1196
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,420
for example, apple laptops seem to be

1197
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,760
repaired and he does it or shows

1198
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,370
people how to do it and he pushed this right

1199
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:41,100
to

1200
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,540
repair a lot. steve

1201
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,700
wozniak built the first apple computer that was

1202
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,890
completely open when

1203
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:50,650
the appeal 2 came out, but then

1204
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:52,780
steve came along  jobs and said no

1205
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,150
, that doesn't happen in my company, there isn't anything like

1206
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:58,450
that and people then lost their

1207
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:01,230
shares in the battery, some others

1208
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:05,860
and steve wozniak but in the process and

1209
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:09,190
and it has quite a lot of

1210
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:11,140
visibility and there are a few

1211
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:13,540
opportunities here and there  also the

1212
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,270
possibility

1213
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:19,150
that the government sees people in the

1214
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:21,190
government that there might be an

1215
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:24,550
advantage if more people see more

1216
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:26,920
people look at security problems

1217
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,870
and that might have noticed that there were a

1218
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:31,750
lot of problems that large

1219
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:33,760
professional companies also had problems in front of,

1220
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,310
it doesn't say anything about it  wanted to be and of

1221
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:37,540
course they don't earn

1222
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,970
as much anymore and have the politicians

1223
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:41,530
will not be re-elected and if they

1224
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:43,830
don't get the money from the

1225
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:46,510
horses it's possible you say

1226
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:48,490
it's not impossible and we

1227
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:51,550
should try to encourage it yes i would

1228
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:54,520
also say that's some of the things that

1229
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,380
really caught my eye in the last

1230
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,870
open hardware  Lately

1231
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:01,930
there have been public institutes such

1232
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:03,760
as public funding and

1233
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,020
doing a lot of work in this

1234
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:07,270
direction. Cern is of course this is

1235
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:09,070
this particle accelerator and laboratory

1236
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:11,740
and so on and you have your own

1237
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:15,130
team and they have been investing for a number of

1238
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:16,350
years

1239
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:19,480
a lot of key card in

1240
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,410
open source design tool and you can see

1241
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:25,650
that there are many possibilities to

1242
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:28,090
move this public funding

1243
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:31,890
then there is the possibility to do really

1244
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:35,050
big publicly funded

1245
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:37,990
science and the eu is funding a lot

1246
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:41,680
and in the usa we don't know exactly

1247
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:47,080
what it is  but there is less there is in

1248
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,690
the eu there is a lot  for

1249
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:52,330
research and such, but that means if we

1250
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:54,580


1251
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,810
pay for it with our taxes, why isn't it open

1252
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,070
and that's a really strong

1253
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:59,080
argument, I mean, how can you argue against it

1254
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,680
, yes, if we pay for it to

1255
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,050
be developed, because then why

1256
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:06,910
are we coming  not to the peppers run

1257
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:09,460
afterwards why why can't we

1258
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,020
see

1259
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,910
how the methodology was how it was

1260
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:15,250
done and there is a very strong

1261
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:17,110
argument here for open science

1262
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:19,030
and we pay for it so it should be

1263
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:21,880
open to the public yes i think

1264
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,230
in germany but that's just one

1265
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:27,240
theory i believe that open hardware

1266
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,530
that or hardware that comes from

1267
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:32,200
science is implicit or

1268
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,950
maybe even

1269
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:38,830
explicitly good for the economy and sometimes

1270
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:42,430
there are the start up companies and

1271
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:46,540
hey that's the idea they have that

1272
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,010
means maybe there's this argument

1273
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:50,790
if  people say

1274
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:54,100
do something with this open

1275
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,800
hardware and maybe we only

1276
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,750
have it  a few minutes here and there

1277
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:02,350
are a lot of questions in this bed and away they

1278
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:03,700
can't answer everything not all of them here

1279
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,980
i have already

1280
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,620
answered a few there is another one that

1281
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,810
might be very interesting but that

1282
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:12,090
is not

1283
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:16,180
possible try it here by the way you

1284
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:18,850
see them  Interesting is the interest

1285
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:21,569
of hackers

1286
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,020
that you, that companies might

1287
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,350
be interested in

1288
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:31,000
making open hardware, I don't know if

1289
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,570
anyone can answer that briefly,

1290
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:36,840
well, if there are projects that

1291
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,730
people have the impression

1292
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:42,750
that they really care about them, of course they

1293
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,430
get them  try to

1294
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:48,130
do that but if you are only

1295
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:50,830
motivated to make money then there are a

1296
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:53,490
lot of people who just want to make money

1297
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:56,710
who also pay a lot of bonuses and then

1298
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:00,340
maybe and i know it was

1299
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:03,940
yesterday there is something about responsible

1300
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:05,190
disclosure

1301
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,740
and that

1302
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:10,270
will happen  also encouraged by people

1303
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:11,890
just knowing it's the right thing to

1304
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,860
do and

1305
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:16,120
some there's a bes  there is a right

1306
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,240
percentage of people who

1307
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,839
do it because they are really

1308
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:22,519
driven from

1309
00:58:22,519 --> 00:58:23,839
within to do it and not just because

1310
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:27,430
they want to make as much money as possible

1311
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:31,039
on this subject i also think there are

1312
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:34,690


1313
00:58:34,869 --> 00:58:39,609
ways to compensate people

1314
00:58:39,609 --> 00:58:42,920
for that bastions  people have to pay for it

1315
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,710
and there is maybe more like

1316
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:51,309
there is an open hardware

1317
00:58:51,309 --> 00:58:54,920
company in mexico and i work with

1318
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:58,819
them and we use microfin

1319
00:58:58,819 --> 00:58:59,920
on an

1320
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,950
m series microcontroller

1321
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:05,390
and i think that's something that happens to us in a way that

1322
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:07,519
happens a lot  and we

1323
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:09,289
need more of them we need

1324
00:59:09,289 --> 00:59:10,539
investments

1325
00:59:10,539 --> 00:59:15,890
and solve problems and in the frameworks

1326
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:18,229
and we need to have different

1327
00:59:18,229 --> 00:59:20,719
chips and if we don't

1328
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:23,359
have enough of the chips we can then reuse

1329
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:26,420
those that are not so

1330
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:29,029
popular but maybe are available and

1331
00:59:29,029 --> 00:59:31,609
maybe if possible  use many things

1332
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:34,779
we can use

1333
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:38,210
and i believe it g  there is also a

1334
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:41,719
need to invest a lot

1335
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:45,789
and

1336
00:59:45,789 --> 00:59:48,069


1337
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:50,900
she talked about helen talked about cern and that

1338
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:54,680
was quite a lot and kate is really

1339
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,489
great today and good to use

1340
00:59:57,489 --> 00:59:59,440


1341
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,849
and out those dealing with it

1342
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:04,359
market is terrible and

1343
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:07,609
now it's really good and that  is it worth investing

1344
01:00:07,609 --> 01:00:09,319
in such tools

1345
01:00:09,319 --> 01:00:10,660


1346
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:13,249
okay but unfortunately

1347
01:00:13,249 --> 01:00:15,140
we have to bring this to an end now we don't have any

1348
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,180
more time but a short comment

1349
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,789
before we go

1350
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:23,269
if the government invests in open hardware and

1351
01:00:23,269 --> 01:00:25,549
open software then that's

1352
01:00:25,549 --> 01:00:28,039
an investment for them  infrastructure of

1353
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:30,469
the whole of society, for example the construction

1354
01:00:30,469 --> 01:00:33,560
of roads and railways

1355
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:37,440
, while others can use

1356
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,569
and take advantage of it and that the

1357
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:42,329
economy supports so many in so many

1358
01:00:42,329 --> 01:00:44,430
ways and that we do

1359
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:47,220
here we do our

1360
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,829
small part that we contribute and

1361
01:00:49,829 --> 01:00:51,839
the  government could multiply that

1362
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,750
and use it then

1363
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:58,079
big on a grand scale nu  tzen yes and

1364
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:59,790
unfortunately we really don't have any more time now

1365
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:02,040
but it was great

1366
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,109
to see you all again and i hope

1367
01:01:04,109 --> 01:01:08,160
we can really see each other again at a congress on painting murder

1368
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,650
maybe next

1369
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:13,260
year maybe at a camp in the summer

1370
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:17,000
maybe in new york who knows and

1371
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,460
yes there is an open source hardware

1372
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:24,270

1373
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:26,910
finally exactly in april or may open

1374
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:29,420

1375
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:34,130
and there is a festival

1376
