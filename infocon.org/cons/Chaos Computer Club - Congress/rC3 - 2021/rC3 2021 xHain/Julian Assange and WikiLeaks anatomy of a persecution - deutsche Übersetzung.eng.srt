i continued to write my

44
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,100

45
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,270
months until i

46
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,709

68
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,268
to make

69
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,249
this available mix here so ask the state

71
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:51,569


72
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,129


73
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:57,310
tracking service and the basis of

74
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,370
this july so far

75
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,889
was that and how it was this  correct and

76
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:06,430
it was really one in questions and

77
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,799
doubts of this prosecution

78
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,980
i had

79
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,609
realized that i had a lot of

80
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:17,589
prejudices against assange and i

81
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,449
didn't know what your evidence was and

82
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:21,459
more as i looked more into

83
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,099
it i saw that nothing

84
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:27,099
against that nothing  as this

85
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:30,419
evidence is not strong they are not

86
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,699
and i could not go to the government

87
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:35,919
women and i could not find it on

88
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,289
the internet and i had to

89
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:42,400
look at it freely myself and and

90
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,860


91
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,680
not convince in london and i

92
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,389
asked if i visited the pictures

93
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:53,460
embassy  could and I have

94
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,630
expedited that he was released

95
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,820
and

96
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,620
are there his release from the

97
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,680
embassy had been planning for a long time

98
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,360
and suddenly everything went fast

99
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,659
and he was then arrested and put

100
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:09,930
in a

101
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,000
maximum security prison and I had

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,970
visited 10 a few weeks later in 2009 with two

103
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,270
different doctors and I did

104
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:24,190
n't know that I would have found torture

105
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,320
I thought he was who  stressed he would be

106
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,169
in poor health he

107
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:31,320
was locked in a room

108
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,870
and he was having

109
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,210
medical

110
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,830
treatment and we i knew we are

111
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,820
in the uk and that there was a

112
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,360
due process

113
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,710


114
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,980
going on and i want had noticed the

115
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,370
way these authorities have reacted to

116
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,970
my on my inquiries they come

117
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,640
didn't want to work

118
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,750
together they didn't want to

119
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,200
listen and both of the doctors i

120
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,720
took were very

121
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,940
specialized

122
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,250
others a psycho

123
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,020
trick

124
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,600
forensic

125
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,730
dr and he had been

126
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,410
looking at torture victims for years and they

127
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,150
both had the

128
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,180
conclusion that shows the consequences of psychological torture and is

129
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,950
psychological torture  not

130
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,770
some easy kind of torture

131
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,140
but one that does the great job of

132
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,410
stabilizing such a

133
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,990
person through

134
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,850
complete constant stress and

135
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,120
all sorts of things is all purposely

136
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,880
used to destroy a person

137
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,790
whose identity destroys their

138
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,000
abilities and you can

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,360


140
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,610
measure neurological neurological changes  because of the

141
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,150
constant speaker and we do

142
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,610
n't switch first came the

143
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,620
silence during he got his

144
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,900
time and since then and when i

145
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,710


146
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,000
talked to the police just

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,860
stopped talking to me and just

148
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,660
like sweden sweden was involved

149
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,930
and  also ecuador and the usa all these

150
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,040
countries

151
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,390
don't have the right to talk and

152
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,920
also many others

153
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,980


154
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:48,500
linda i am commissioned by the un and torture

155
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,560
i am when i

156
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,270
talk to people a deodorant that is very important but when

157
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,020
i talk to countries as  man who was

158
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,870
asked by countries tortures

159
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,150
nachzuve  then i hope i get

160
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,700
at least talked to and when

161
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,170
i saw that i was sure

162
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,030
something is wrong here and

163
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,470
i really looked at that i looked at the

164
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,950
case closely and i looked

165
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,880
deep into the swedish

166
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,910
case i got into the

167
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,100
looked at the american case and

168
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,260
there we saw that the usa accuses it of

169
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,190
espionage and i looked at a

170
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,960
sent case pine i looked

171
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,300
into it that the dirt

172
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,130
wasn't on assange's side

173
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,830
but on the governments side and that's

174
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,740
something that's the long answer  why

175
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,940
did i look at this case because

176
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,370
if we have a torture case in a

177
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,430
country that has a constitutional state in

178
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,770
a western democracy like sweden

179
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,820
and great britain and as a united

180
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,040
states if i have further after that if

181
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,080
i go with specialists to racist

182
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,090
doctors and all that

183
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,510
matches then

184
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,720
they must

185
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:10,140
legally look after it and put it in the

186
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,790
shabby but  this is not a discussion

187
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,540
but if the magazine

188
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,130
can just ignore such cases

189
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,290
can afford to ignore these cases

190
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,940
what does that mean about our

191
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,670
society and that was the first

192
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,730
question i solve gold and

193
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,480
what does that mean for our

194
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,240
freedom of the press what does that mean and i

195
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,880
at  anif the lists for freedom freedom of the

196
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,130
press but we have a person here

197
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,700


198
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,070
who is being prosecuted because

199
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,630
the

200
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,720
information has been published and has published

201
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,790
two true pieces of information that

202
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,460


203
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,200
shows

204
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,270
very good qualities by government employees bad things and very very nice range of

205
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:05,420
crimes and if we are now a catfish

206
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,360
it is  prohibit penalties

207
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,710
which means that we people who are

208
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,350
journalists

209
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,320
when people like you can no longer

210
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,900
work what does that mean for all of us for

211
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,510
our

212
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,880
society we have a right to know what the

213
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,120
governments are doing with the power we

214
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,520
give them in a democracy with

215
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,560
money  that we pay through our taxes

216
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,870
is that a it is criminal

217
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,140
to ask the research questions

218
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,600
that is why it is so important it is

219
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,330
just as important as for every other

220
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,420
person who

221
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,980
drives that is a that sets a

222
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,620
bad example for the functioning of

223
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,160
democracy and for the rule of law

224
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,020
absolutely

225
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,960
you have  book the bathhouse comes in

226
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,090
february

227
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:17,110
its investigations into this case

228
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,170
i had the chapter of the collateral

229
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,800
murder your analysis was brutal

230
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,170
you

231
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,720
you analyze that of your you expect

232
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,529
from the victory point

233
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,950
i ask you to do a quick

234
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,160
analysis for the public to

235
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,029
explain the war crimes

236
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:46,339
what are your

237
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,250
kisses i'll show the book briefly so

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,560
february

240

it's was in the beginning i explain my

241
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,810
role

242
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,880
giving in connection with wikileaks and

243
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,860
this collateral murder video was

244
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,470
really important to use which was the first

245
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,910
release of wikileaks

246
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,060
this video that was recorded in

247
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,519
a

248
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,769
helicopter have a military  helicopter of

249
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:23,839
the us military is a standard

250
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,050
standard camera shot it shows

251
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,360
this helicopter circling over discount

252
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,029
and we see people on the street you

253
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:35,220
can hear you hand through the radii

254
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,040
communication

255
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,310
and the helicopter reports that you

256
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:46,190
some people with ak 45 open so

257
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,740
automatic weapon kalashnikov

258
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,240
are out and they ask

259
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,610
permission to shoot and we

260
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,000
can't see armed people but to

261
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,790
be serious we can see two

262
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,620
people through one in a group of

263
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,020
twenty maybe carrying a gun

264
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,910
but we also need to know in

265
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,120
2007 when this was recorded  and butt

266
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,060
has the us

267
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,050
forces had authorized the iraqi people to own

268
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,699


269
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:19,589
kalashnikovs and have them

270
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:22,260
at home and to protect themselves

271
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,079


272
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,720
after the invasion of third parties and and

273
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,240
the us rule of law and

274
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,850
collapsed and the people

275
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,709
had to protect themselves who it was

276
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:35,520
actually

277
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,130
that they carry these guns and they

278
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,770
had  n rather run is to shoot and

279
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,950
what we could see

280
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,750
the group of ten people were

281
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,710
simply killed as massacred they

282
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,740
walked mariella very calmly on the

283
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,510
street they had not prepared any attack

284
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,270
we know some

285
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,610
us soldiers

286
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,160
on the radio communication some

287
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,220
us soldiers were  on the ground

288
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,320
nearby but no one prepared an attack

289
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,440
and we see these

290
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,870
people getting

291
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,200
killed

292
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,670
and you can see these bloody

293
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,500
bastards these comments but

294
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,860
the mostly the most depressing

295
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,350
thing is that we had this helicopter power of

296
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,650
a habitual and they talk about

297
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,970
what they see the  people and their

298
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,790
bodies and they are the injured

299
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,550
who are still

300
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,200
around and you know that you are

301
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,280
not allowed to attack injured people

302
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,689
and i am not a conflict expert

303
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,840
martial law and i have

304
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,970
taught that i have analyzed

305
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,430
these armed operations and i

306
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,220
can tell that they are  Soldiers know

307
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,500
that they don't want to, that they are

308
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,940
n't right  tswise these people

309
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,450
are allowed to be stopped in a war you ca

310
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,320
n't attack someone

311
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,330
who wants to save these people you ca

312
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,040
n't

313
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,630
try this and some of these

314
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,820
people are trying to save

315
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,090
those

316
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,330
wounded journalists and some

317
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,390
us soldiers

318
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,850
asked permission to

319
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,990
shoot and them  got this

320
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,720
permission got

321
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,310
permission and they did it is

322
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,680
massacre of

323
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,970
the injured people and even

324
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,670
those who tried to help

325
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,070
you see a mini bus the two

326
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,420
children of whom were injured by the city

327
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,510
and that was clearly

328
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,420
a war crime

329
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,910
and someone who  that's trying to

330
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,040
save them

331
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,640
that's without question a war crime

332
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,340
in the first in the first scene we have to be

333
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,710
fair i think these

334
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,020
helicopters

335
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,010
are circling a mile and a half away

336
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,780
and that's being captured by the blade objective

337
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,090
lens that's not

338
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,790
quite not that in the  close and you

339
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,230
can't really see it we  nn you out the

340
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,720
window she is and you have to rely

341
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,390
on this picture and you

342
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,030
can only see it very much at once in

343
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,220
real time and you have to decide right away and

344
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,860
you can't rewind it and watch it again

345
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,490
because that when

346
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,690
you say all that you still have to

347
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:55,680
Doctors say the first attack was

348
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,140
at least one

349
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,320
very sloppy texting error and that

350
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,109
's already crossing a

351
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:08,470
line but the second to

352
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,050


353
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,390
hook up an injured person and the soldiers

354
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:17,020
know that's wrong and they say

355
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,260
oh no someone

356
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,140
give it up  maybe someone

357
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,780
can then pick up the guns and shoot

358
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,730
but that the rules

359
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,280
are clear to them that you can't do that because

360
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,260
every scandal is everyone knows that and the

361
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,780
soldiers knew that and the us

362
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,090
department

363
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,100
he knew that and the government is

364
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,280
aware that they

365
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,510
the  public knows that

366
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,900
if you see this it's obvious

367
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,299
nobody hates anyone would

368
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:55,750
be punished or put on trial for it

369
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,929
let me stop you

370
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:03,160
why was no one prosecuted

371
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,559
why was there no

372
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:10,030


373
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:13,309
trial why isn't américas granted the right to step in

374
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:16,010
no one can prosecute her for war

375
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:20,630
crimes and now legal every

376
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,730
country in the world could or should

377
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,760
even prosecute these people

378
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,090
as soon as she

379
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:32,559
comes back  these are legal

380
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,150
criminal files if i commit a

381
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,720
war crime i don't care where i

382
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,000
commit no matter where i come from the country

383
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,940
where i am has to prosecute me not

384
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,500
prosecute that says the geneva

385
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,080
convention that was

386
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,169
the icp too and the geneva convention

387
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:57,970
and the us have a deficit

388
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,590
the reason is clear it's a

389
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,850
political reason no one dares to persecute the

390
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,770
american soldiers

391
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,600
if the usa

392
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,940
doesn't do it itself that our what

393
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,530
worries me is that the us doesn't do it

394
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,270
and because that's actually also in the

395
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,059
interests of the usa

396
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:19,160
to persecute them  who

397
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,380
break the rules, who

398
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,850
that don't stand up and that

399
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,160
the cdc pliening armies in the

400
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,770
military is

401
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,230
bad that if you don't follow

402
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:33,940


403
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,130
the rules don't follow the rules

404
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,200


405
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,360
and therefore also follow the human rights of these people

406
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,950
in which they

407
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,970
ring receive compensation

408
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,150
and that also means that these things

409
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,600
spread this action that  then becomes

410
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,780
normal over time that's exactly what

411
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,590
many have said it's not an

412
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,120
exception that was the standard

413
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,040
approach that happens every day

414
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,710
and that's something that's a big

415
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,930
scandal that others would like to say

416
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,930
is there are even bigger

417
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,140
scandals  it's the ones who are being persecuted are being

418
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,450
persecuted and that's the person who published this

419
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,810
information and

420
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:28,030
the journalists who published

421
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,500
it and that's something that really

422
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,750
diddy diddy right world is right

423
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,710
understanding turns around the murderers go

424
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,980
free

425
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,160
the

426
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,559
[music]

427
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:08,139
democracy in germany

428
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,590
the  get

429
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,720
this information and publish this information that

430
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,720
is and  then you have to say that such

431
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,980
a journalist does

432
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,630
exactly what we do every day

433
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,429
[music]

434
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:31,360
i am now an honest fresh

435
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,490
stefan yes if i gave a usb stick the

436
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,970
vines with this video or the

437
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,440
second video of it and

438
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,660
250 more diplomatic ones  interventions would

439
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,030
you publish that so ten

440
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,799
years ago you would have that publicly because it is

441
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,630
currently even used by der Spiegel and

442
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,790


443
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,290
they wanted everyone to publish together with

444
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,140
sas but nowadays

445
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,620
they would

446
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,520
no longer talk about what is

447
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,799
happening here and if i were happy

448
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,780
you would have  you scared of what happens now

449
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,370
will you be really

450
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,870
comfortable releasing the stuff now

451
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,590


452
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,279
yes i'm scared i feel

453
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:22,640
scared i would

454
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,860
n't hand this over with very much

455
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,350
caution because i'm not really

456
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,409
protected anymore from anything we

457
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:34,010
've seen in the last 13 years how

458
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,870
this case has been invested and an

459
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:41,190
hour has been tried and attorneys have

460
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,520
al  les tried they tried the laws

461
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,250
they asked for asylum they

462
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,700
talked to

463
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,100
the media about it

464
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,860
they tried everything and

465
00:22:54,860 --> 00:23:00,179
except the un authorities they said when

466
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,399


467
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:05,720
i pay bowl is for

468
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,760
torture nothing happens at all and

469
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,549
i there is a reason why  one is

470
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:13,220
anxious there and i think

471
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,539
that is the question we have to ask

472
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:18,809
ourselves it is not about being

473
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:21,510
extradited to the usa yes that is also

474
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,039
an important question but it does

475
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,100
happen the example has already been

476
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,110
set this person was in the last ten years

477
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,200
in the last ten

478
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,039
years not free

479
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:37,669
the country has

480
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:40,500
and because a country doesn't want it to speak

481
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,029
the truth about their own mistakes

482
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:45,059
nothing has been proven they have

483
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,039
tried very hard we have spent millions

484
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,770


485
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,809
to find and wise but everything else

486
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:55,010
by

487
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,309
hedging state council it  there is no proof anywhere

488
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:03,000
and this is all set up to write in a

489
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,950
corner but also for people like

490
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,960
us to under  support

491
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,600
that's the effect of it all yes it

492
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,640
's about islamic its health and

493
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,909
its personal eed and two-stroke but for

494
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:22,020
me it's now that's a generally

495
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,350
important place is it

496
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:28,309
from your side

497
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,020
you've always had the courage and

498
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,179
you've always

499
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,010
looked for secrets  for this seeks to solve

500
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:39,270
and that was very valuable and wisely

501
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,110
produced and we know that there is a lot

502
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,789
still known and held safe

503
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:47,900
by the american states and

504
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,000
what we need to be afraid of

505
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,980
losing that access to the truth

506
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,059
that is so important to democracy

507
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:58,010
accurate

508
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,010
and

509
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:04,110
we know that is exactly what they

510
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,830
want and why we have to fight against

511
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,710
it because it

512
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,360
is now a matter of which company we

513
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,110
want and

514
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,500
if we

515
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,340
allow

516
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,809
kohler to continue in the current court case because of these

517
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:26,220
extraditions then we have a

518
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,600
significant problem with

519
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,539
freedom of the press in england with

520
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:31,820
investigative journalism

521
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,080
and it's all right the

522
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,080
public is too wi  ssen

523
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,169
it's about the it's not just about the

524
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:41,640
am and it has to be about the

525
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,690
public and that's also right

526
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:47,669
it could maybe be done here by hair

527
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:50,130
or very much and that's only

528
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,830
mechanical and everything will be

529
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,309
fine but no if we  this is

530
00:25:56,309 --> 00:26:00,350
history look at this is exactly how

531
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,809
the dictators worked in the

532
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:07,250
past how they built their

533
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,260
empires you capture and

534
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,620
destroy their

535
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,960
personal budget any weird

536
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,490
bad

537
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:19,350
times creams or things that can't be

538
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,169
proven and destroy their

539
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:24,059
their public appearances and when the

540
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,609
the whole public is sure that this is

541
00:26:26,609 --> 00:26:29,609
a bad person then he makes

542
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:32,850
an example out of that and within the framework of freedom of the

543
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,649
press but nobody cares

544
00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:37,679
about him because it's just him nobody likes him

545
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,929
because he's a whole page of

546
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:41,759
public view it destroys but

547
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:44,429
that's why it should be the standard case  to

548
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:46,259
be applied to everyone afterwards and that's what

549
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:48,629
they're trying to do and i believe that i  It's

550
00:26:48,629 --> 00:26:50,220
very very important that we

551
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,850
know that it's not about whether we

552
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,950
like to say it or not it's about whether

553
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,179
we like the rights he has and

554
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:04,940
which each hand the

555
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,129
rights freedom of speech not just the rights to

556
00:27:08,129 --> 00:27:10,619
say what he wants and to  think what

557
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:12,989
you want but also get all the

558
00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:16,409
information the public has

559
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:20,999
the right to read and to listen and a part of the freedom of the press

560
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:23,119


561
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:25,739
if the government is

562
00:27:25,739 --> 00:27:27,029
doing something wrong and that is what you

563
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:28,519
want to suppress

564
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:32,549
that a compress theory then it is

565
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:35,299
very obvious that the

566
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:41,070
de  the torture and the killing

567
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,230
of people that's something that has been

568
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,059
proven that no government has ever said

569
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:47,129
it's not that's not true they've never

570
00:27:47,129 --> 00:27:49,739
claimed that any information

571
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:53,179
what wikileaks has shown is wrong and

572
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:56,179
that's why the people should

573
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,240
actually be prosecuted in

574
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,040
court  and some of

575
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,330
them should spend years in prison

576
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,070
but they will say but

577
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:08,070
i received orders go on o  ben

578
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:12,330
and it goes further up and it

579
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,150
doesn't end in the attack helicopter but

580
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,440
ends up somewhere in a

581
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,480
government building in a small

582
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,970
nice office or a big office with

583
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,630
reviews

584
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,670
with

585
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,200
nice surroundings there is a person

586
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,810
who is responsible for it and

587
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:35,090
that's why they criminalize what else

588
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,870
classify the information when

589
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:40,219
they republish what you

590
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,720
all end up

591
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,660
doing but not because of wg

592
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,250
national security but we

593
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,470
promises for you if you are

594
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,770


595
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,190
afraid of someone with murderer if you simply present all the

596
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,290
information you bring up the

597
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,390
cards simply against simply

598
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,150
can just assume then he can

599
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,180
just murder yes governments

600
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,830
just want to iron out mistakes too but

601
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:16,699
that's why we have to make it

602
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:20,990
public we have

603
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:24,600
to work to ensure that there is an overview

604
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,780
and

605
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:31,580
that serious crime of this kind is also

606
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,490
dealt with because it is the

607
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,350
foundations of our society, our

608
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,870
democracy

609
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,600
sc  Hadet but freedoms

610
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,890
and if you now

611
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:47,820
look at the legal consequences for yourself it is not

612
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,520
easy but I have looked at every

613
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,790
single legal case from the

614
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,940
Swedish

615
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,590
allegations

616
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:00,340
of sexual abuse and

617
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,370
I cannot

618
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,309
document them and I also have their

619
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:09,280
documents which

620
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,420
you can see in the cemetery  for

621
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,990
people or city park in place

622
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,610
i don't know what happened but

623
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:19,070
what i do know is that the swedish

624
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,900
government never bothered about it

625
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,429
they just wanted to give out the

626
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:28,210
information from the start

627
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,010
and they don't want him to have

628
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,380
the chance to

629
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,630
have a fair trial in court  to

630
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,780
get

631
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,450
and he didn't stand up to the

632
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,870
sexual information stuff

633
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,420
governments

634
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,580
he wanted to testify in that case he

635
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,250
was afraid the swedes would put him in the

636
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,630
usa without

637
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:59,030
he just wanted guarantees from them and

638
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,100
the swedes didn't want to give any guarantees

639
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,010
and that's really something  what

640
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,690
i can say from international

641
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,980
experience there  it's really a

642
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,980
warning if a country doesn't want to

643
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,050
guarantee this you shouldn't do that

644
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,200


645
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,030
and he was right not to go there

646
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,420
and he took

647
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,640


648
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,950
advantage of these institutions that they

649
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,600
suspect he

650
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,350
raped her just to be able to stay

651
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,630
there and

652
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:35,929
and  the economic pressures

653
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:39,200
exerted by equatorial pressures the usa has been

654
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,740
putting pressure on ecuador and has

655
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:47,090
written evidence from congress from the us

656
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,300
congress that the pressures have been exerted

657
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,080
and we would like to

658
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,840
talk about economic situations we

659
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,710
will help you but there is a one

660
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:05,110
problem and that is the situation with

661
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:08,450
and we can't you have to hand

662
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:11,180
it over so that we can help you and

663
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:15,700
this this letter from october 2018

664
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:19,580
to president moreno then it was clear

665
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,940
and moreno was the third party

666
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,160
and worked together with the usa to

667
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,190
deliver it and that was without a

668
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,700
rule of law predecessor

669
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,560
carried out and that was

670
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,540
taken away from him or he says with s  of one

671
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,690
nationality and he had no right to

672
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,850
a lawyer

673
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,930
it was expelled from one hour to the next

674
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:45,710
and the britain

675
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,680
has the same it

676
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,650
is actually the fundamental

677
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,810
rule of law that britain

678
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:57,550
is that and i have that and we see a

679
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:01,270
judge publicly insulted him

680
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,470
in a  in a

681
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,120
court case and he didn't

682
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,670
say anything except that you weren't interesting

683
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,040
and we still have a judge in the first

684
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:16,180
few months before his extradition and

685
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,700
your husband was produced by

686
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,820
wikileaks and was put in a

687
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,100
maximum security

688
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,940


689
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,950
prison and he hasn't been convicted he hasn't been convicted

690
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,669
only held there

691
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:41,989
and normally people should

692
00:33:41,989 --> 00:33:45,409
be able to work and have a family

693
00:33:45,409 --> 00:33:46,840
and at least

694
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,940
travel one at least be put

695
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,539
under house arrest and

696
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:56,629
maybe with as well as bp there is no

697
00:33:56,629 --> 00:33:57,940
legal basis

698
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,080
for putting someone in a maximum

699
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,419
security prison and they did that

700
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:04,570
to him to

701
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,580
silence him  bring

702
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,109
jou  intimidating nalists that's why

703
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:11,889
when you see this

704
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:15,139
i'd like to stop you i

705
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:16,960
'd like to ask you something other than what was

706
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,020
serious that the series had

707
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:25,569
tried to poison him or kidnap him

708
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,469
it's given so little

709
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:33,040
thought we

710
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,889
realize how little that was

711
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:39,099
considering the legal procedures

712
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:40,940
we've had

713
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,349
indicators before the security work that

714
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:47,989
protected the about torian embassy

715
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:51,790
that was behind the

716
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,839
ecuadorian government that worked with

717
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,260
the cia

718
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,109
that had security cameras from the embassy

719
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:03,290
that broadcast 24 7 alicia and

720
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:06,049
we already had indicators  before that

721
00:35:06,049 --> 00:35:08,290
it testified

722
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:11,260
companies went to court

723
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,119
that's

724
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,480
about that's

725
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,380
just against assange ins to kill

726
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:25,240
and the yahoo testimony

727
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:30,430
where more than 30

728
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,150
agents testified that there were plans

729
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,270
to kidnap

730
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,310


731
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,450
him and make him disappear and

732
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,440


733
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,320
kill him at least that  in has been considered

734
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,200
un  d you noticed that it was

735
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,110
dangerous and you tried to

736
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,820
poison and now another case like

737
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:55,270
navarri, for example everyone knows everyone

738
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,150
says that there are

739
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,860
rumors that the russian

740
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,600
government tried to

741
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,000
poison you and is talking about it vega

742
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,910
had that's what it's about  now only in navi's

743
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,250
case

744
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:12,340
everyone is protesting all western

745
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,160
governments

746
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,470
have a lot of courage

747
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,900
against russia before but

748
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,380
if it's against the deg then nobody

749
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,060
dares to say anything and that's

750
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,320
about this hypo crass this this

751
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,690
unequal treatment this is not just

752
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,120
disappointing  that it is scandalous a

753
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,880
scandal that it

754
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,440
threatens our the basis of our

755
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,360
society

756
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,330
if someone commits a criminal

757
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:46,450
act then bring the evidence and

758
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:49,660
condemn him but you don't know what

759
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,610
you have against him because he hasn't done

760
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,670


761
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:59,500
anything just plays football in the embassy and

762
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,690
you see  all those headlines in the

763
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,750
newspapers but they don't cover enough

764
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:08,200
practice about their own  a job as a

765
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,300
journalist to actually

766
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,640
talk about what is actually

767
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,040
happening that journalism is being

768
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,480
criminalized and that is at the

769
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,470
heart of this mission that of the bbc and

770
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,680
the new york times and

771
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,670
to say it very bluntly and i

772
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:28,920
have concerns about the mainstream media

773
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,440
shall we say  the alternative converse post

774
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,950
or league of guardians if they together had

775
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:41,150
purposely

776
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:46,050
launched an action to

777
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,650
condemn this for a week that would be

778
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,290


779
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:54,720
the government doesn't mind no

780
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,140
evidence all they can do is

781
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:01,070


782
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:05,000
escort some covert surveillance

783
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,540
and no one can know

784
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,110
to then judge him against against for

785
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,870
anything and no one can

786
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:19,310
see this evidence that is a yes

787
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:22,610
that is nothing due process

788
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:26,550
and western societies and

789
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:29,340
around the world but western

790
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,190
democracies

791
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,740
deserve the

792
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,690
traditions of the rule of law and that

793
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,810
you respect that  and that is very

794
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,710
careful that is

795
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:45,990
I'm very worried about that and I'm putting the

796
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,630
personal

797
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,430
reputation in

798
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,780
there because it's about our

799
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,300
rights and the rights of our

800
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,940
children to know what the government is

801
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:02,130
doing and so he makes the

802
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:04,010
governments give to the hosts and if we

803
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,110
allow it

804
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,390
someone is

805
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:11,490
convicted of something like that then we live

806
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,740
in a theory

807
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,150
and that this is something that we care about

808
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,330
very much we we

809
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,000
realize this case is

810
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,020
essential we can't

811
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,630
lose this let me ask one last

812
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,810
question

813
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,960
we ask that we will ask the

814
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,990
open to the public

815
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:37,260
this freely about julian assange

816
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,970
it's not just about it's also about the

817
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,760
wikileaks

818
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,890
students

819
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:47,760
and there is now this case

820
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,010
that he is now in prison under that

821
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:54,430
is that could happen to others too

822
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,290
and the real students were

823
00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:00,720
flown to hong kong and many  there were many other

824
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,970
freedom of information requests in the

825
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,610


826
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:12,390
uk involving these three

827
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:15,540
students

828
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,100
and they could do anything they wanted  can

829
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,350
to

830
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,710


831
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,940
deny access to these documents to get access to these documents

832
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,640


833
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:34,860
this case predominates lays

834
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,050
students it's been enough for more than six years what's

835
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,120
happening now in this case what's

836
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,370
next what i think i want to end this case

837
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:48,150
the second president of

838
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:54,750
the  2 they were will they were

839
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:58,630
this case was created about him

840
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,270
once this is done then she

841
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:04,570
will carry on this is not the end this

842
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:07,720
is the beginning of a new era to be

843
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,260
followed by journalists who will

844
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,170


845
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,450
keep you telling the truth about government misconduct and that

846
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,060
sets  a

847
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,280
role model and the way we talk as we

848
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,640
follow this case

849
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,040
countries are changing their

850
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,530
regulation of these laws

851
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:32,640
in britain as the official

852
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,549
security pact is tightened the

853
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,900
interpretation sweden has just passed

854
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,349
foreign espionage

855
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,530
law and sweden was

856
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,320
actually the

857
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,300
haven of press freedom and it

858
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,099
actually wanted press freedom already mr

859
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:59,490
assange words pr  establish essepreis in

860
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:02,410
sweden and sweden just two

861
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:06,150
months ago passed a law

862
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:09,540
1 sp1

863
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:12,510
published it will be a

864
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:15,840
criminal act

865
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,160
because if you

866
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,170
publish secret data and it is enough that it has

867
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,410
negative effects on the relationship

868
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,210
of china with other countries and

869
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,250
that if it that the  standard it is such

870
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:30,640
a low standard the diplomatic

871
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,240
publication something that is just

872
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,970
embarrassing e.g. between sweden and

873
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,220


874
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,349
austria let's take for example just

875
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:43,480
embarrassing then it's enough that it becomes

876
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,010
criminal to publish this data

877
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:47,320
that means that you have to create water

878
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,839
is that that here

879
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:51,790
that  a system is being created here not

880
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:54,130
only in the usa also in england and the

881
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:56,849
whole english speaking but also in

882
00:42:56,849 --> 00:42:59,800
many allied countries which places a

883
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,530
system where it becomes a criminal act

884
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:06,000
to tell the truth and that is an

885
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,550
important case the field has to say

886
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:12,310
that try  to stop we must have a

887
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:14,760
right to know

888
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,400
exactly

889
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,290
what do you expect from the legal process

890
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:24,350
in england in the next gladly

891
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:27,290
unfortunately i cant expect any justice there

892
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:29,760
i had hopes

893
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,460
not

894
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,080
pessimistic get a firm

895
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,110
hope that he gets

896
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:39,830
high it is the supreme court

897
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:42,840
supporting what i suspected thats

898
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,210
what happened i have  it's been

899
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,010
said publicly before that happened exactly

900
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:49,970
as i suspected

901
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:54,410
i believe the english

902
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,150
rule of law ca

903
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:00,380
n't get any law right

904
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:05,490
that it was about the

905
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:08,210
rule of law and

906
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,140
maybe extend it a

907
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,990
bit more what is the usa has no

908
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:15,000
objection in england in prison dies

909
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,620
that  it's much better you do

910
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,360
n't have to worry about what you want

911
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:18,920


912
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,910
everyone to know including

913
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:27,260
what happens if you ever

914
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,820
interact with american secrets

915
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,190
i don't know exactly how that's going to

916
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,220
happen but by and large

917
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,070
there these states don't have for ten than usual

918
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:40,980
years has followed ten mill  ions

919
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,460
to millions

920
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,410
spent and mines that he will be released

921
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:47,850
soon that means the only case

922
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:50,370
he has and that is a real chance

923
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:52,920
that if public opinion

924
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,890
changes if the main

925
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:56,820
media organizations change their mind

926
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:59,190
then that's over that's just

927
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,980
how waking up will be  a nightmare but

928
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,770
if nothing changes then we have

929
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:08,460
a long long process a long

930
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,270
nightmare fans thank you for the

931
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:14,250
questions from the internet if you

932
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,960
want to ask questions you can also write in german

933
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,170
in decent style

934
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:20,600
or are there already many questions that have

935
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,380
arrived there

936
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:27,530
the beginning of all this  story what

937
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:30,310
do you expect did you expect

938
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:33,380
in the first instance

939
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,380
when it comes to

940
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,550
torture happening in england writing someone

941
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:42,920
letters you would expect

942
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,350
police to come by but what would you

943
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:48,190
normally expect

944
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:53,450
when i get torture guess the

945
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,520
very first thing that happened is me  look at

946
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,560
it that is credible if you

947
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,740
no longer gl  are awkward then

948
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,510
i try to find out what

949
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,120
happened if issues is the person

950
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,800


951
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,620
open to

952
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,900
call the organizations to look at the information

953
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,100
is credible it doesnt need to

954
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,480
be proven so its got to be

955
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,980
credible then i go with the governments it

956
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,790
is an urgent case it comes down to it

957
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:22,190
a historic of 15 years is if

958
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,500
only to look then it's not urgent

959
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,000
then we can just take our time

960
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,460


961
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:30,710
because use full time case if someone is to be

962
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:33,040
killed

963
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,200
or deported last then i can

964
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,630
write a letter to

965
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,430
the foreign minister of the

966
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,910
country concerned within 24 hours

967
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:46,840
as a ten

968
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,550
person i always go through the

969
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:53,440
foreign minister via switzerland about the

970
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,320
diplomatic situation in geneva and they

971
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,150
pass it on to their respective

972
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,140
organization if it is a

973
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,150
police station then you have to pass it

974
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,860
on to the police and so on

975
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,080
but

976
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,820
depending on the country  and the

977
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,370
specific

978
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:12,460
situations is un  Different

979
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,480
organizations you have to talk to,

980
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,190
but it's about a diplomatic

981
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,960
protocol. I always have to go through the

982
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,270
Foreign Ministry

983
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,280
and they then have to start these investigations

984
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,260
within the country. Thank you very

985
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:31,090
much. The next question is

986
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:35,230


987
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:39,040
to be able to address the European Court of Justice, how long

988
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,360
will that take  are there

989
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,370
any

990
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:45,830
things that can

991
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:49,460
still be done by the lawyers i'm not

992
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:52,400
his lawyer but then if so then

993
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,680
you would have to talk to them with the legal team

994
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,320
his legal issues but yes

995
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,410
any point as soon as the last

996
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,549
instance in

997
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,950
münster

998
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:09,040
in england has an

999
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,230
opinion  then you can go on to the

1000
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,860
human court of human rights

1001
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:20,110
and the human court

1002
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:25,450
and they could already interact

1003
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:28,390
with him

1004
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:30,800
before now that he will

1005
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,400
only be converted to house arrest his

1006
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,310
prison the situation yes there is a

1007
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:39,320
possibility to go as a human rights case of the

1008
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,300
european union and  you  e

1009
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,920
question how because that lasts depends on so

1010
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,300
many factors what are the strategies

1011
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,880
of everyone how long do they take to

1012
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,720
decide

1013
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,820
maybe two weeks or four months

1014
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,890
depends on what they want the

1015
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,010
judges want to decide and

1016
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:59,310
it could be

1017
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,450
at least a year but it could still

1018
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:04,859
three years or so

1019
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,119
i also wanted to give an important

1020
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,369
information about the european union human rights court

1021
00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:11,859
the

1022
00:49:11,859 --> 00:49:13,930
information i got from

1023
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:15,780
my freedom of

1024
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,030
information

1025
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:21,060
information is that the

1026
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,650
english

1027
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:24,490
organizations and talk to ethical

1028
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:27,280
organizations that they don't

1029
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,970
want to allow him ten human

1030
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,630
human rights european

1031
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:33,880
human rights  to be able to address the court

1032
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,410
that means an

1033
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:41,020
attempt was made that he could make

1034
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:41,830
all the decisions before the european court of justice

1035
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:42,940
that he would

1036
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,430
already be expelled

1037
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:47,770
these are simply playing games yes that

1038
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:50,580
is credible the problem is that

1039
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:55,859
normally a court case or

1040
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,859
not the

1041
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:02,250
validity de  s national information

1042
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:06,540
from cancels that means if the

1043
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,740
expulsions are allowed then it can still

1044
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,900
be expelled except that the

1045
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,640
european court of human beings

1046
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,440
immediately

1047
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,440


1048
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,190
demands initial actions this world is holds

1049
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,630
suspend the validity are

1050
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:26,560
it still has to be decided

1051
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,020
and between the decision that the

1052
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:32,369
court does so from west

1053
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,640
dms message is delivered it

1054
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,920
takes a few days and if you

1055
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,540
just traveled him out in that time

1056
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,940
then it might be easy to do and it

1057
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,300
is very important that the

1058
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,150
lawyers

1059
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:50,770
respond quickly and

1060
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,359
ask about it now but i think his

1061
00:50:52,359 --> 00:50:55,359
his legal team is a  better point is

1062
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,960
and answer these questions

1063
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,720
[music]

1064
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,760
i hope that the next episodes

1065
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,079
can also answer what is

1066
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:09,480
the government's opinion why they are

1067
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,970
doing this and what happens to other people

1068
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:14,119
who are at high risk of

1069
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:17,630
absconding who are in prison in england

1070
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:21,119
the government says  only is a

1071
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,789
flight risk yes there is  one of them

1072
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:29,779
asked, especially in the

1073
00:51:29,779 --> 00:51:33,180
ecuadorian embassy, because he asked himself the

1074
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,059
whole deportation

1075
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:37,770
concept is illegal for

1076
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:39,140
various reasons, because

1077
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,599
espionage is what political practice is about,

1078
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,150
because such freedom of the press is about, but

1079
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:49,109
even if we accept the argument if

1080
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:51,839
we assume that it is a valid

1081
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,839
ID card  as a further procedure there is now

1082
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:57,960
a risk of fleeing yes then you

1083
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,420
can secure your presence but you

1084
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:03,650
have to use the least

1085
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:06,390
the weakest way to

1086
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:08,660
realize that you simply cannot

1087
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:12,599
use the method the idea is stronger

1088
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:16,910
than necessary if you are

1089
00:52:17,089 --> 00:52:19,980
not simply under house arrest  and put

1090
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,960
a person in front of it then that's

1091
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,740
better and it's cheaper and

1092
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,420
what you did with gustav binder che

1093
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,490
shouldn't have done journalism

1094
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:33,020
but he's supposed to have killed a lot of people

1095
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,789
, 1000 people by 1000

1096
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:37,980
people killed than any

1097
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:42,250
chile and the british

1098
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:46,920
because a friend of england and he was

1099
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:51,150
absent  hen he was also from

1100
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,830


1101
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:56,250
the bad cases he was

1102
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,750
allowed to stand in the luxurious villa for a year and a half

1103
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:01,360
was visited by fetzer

1104
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,000
but julian assange is being held

1105
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,680
in a

1106
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,570


1107
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:11,610


1108
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:13,290


1109
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,390
maximum security prison although these situations are the same it is not a dangerous person it is in the strongest security prison  where

1110
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:17,550
violent people is kept a criminal

1111
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:19,570
and that just

1112
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:22,320
doesn't fit

1113
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,180
everywhere we have been kept as a where

1114
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,330
he

1115
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:30,630
has a right

1116
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:32,520


1117
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,070
to have family life his family and

1118
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:38,860
his health is in

1119
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:40,960
dire dire situation and

1120
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,680
i visited two years

1121
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,390
ago and have  were warned

1122
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,730
his health

1123
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:51,760
was failing he wasn't even able to hear his

1124
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,100
own

1125
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,800
his own

1126
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,800
hearing he had a

1127
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,730
heart attack during the hearing it is

1128
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:06,550
that the judges

1129
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:09,610
decided his health was good

1130
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:11,190
enough to put him in the

1131
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:14,970
expel usa due to a few

1132
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:19,080
basic

1133
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,070
statements that don't protect him at all

1134
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:23,490


1135
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:28,530
the real question fits right in. you

1136
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:32,530
are sure you wo

1137
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:34,720
n't be amazed at him i'm the

1138
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,640
opposite i'm sure you'll

1139
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,290
research him further it's impossible

1140
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:41,170
for him to get a public case and

1141
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:43,060
a definitive case

1142
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:45,300
the

1143
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,290
public behavior is so strong

1144
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:49,930
against him he will have to come to light in alexandria people

1145
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:51,649


1146
00:54:51,649 --> 00:54:54,499
espionage in court

1147
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:58,109
of a secret court case and

1148
00:54:58,109 --> 00:54:59,789
usually the defense

1149
00:54:59,789 --> 00:55:01,939
no longer has the necessary information

1150
00:55:01,939 --> 00:55:04,039
against the

1151
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:06,599
announced there is no press that

1152
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:08,749
is there there is

1153
00:55:08,749 --> 00:55:13,259
that  jury takes information directly

1154
00:55:13,259 --> 00:55:16,380
from defense defense

1155
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,969
has no access to this

1156
00:55:17,969 --> 00:55:20,159
information no one has ever been

1157
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:23,959
acquitted in the case that a

1158
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:28,979
national security and people

1159
00:55:28,979 --> 00:55:31,549
there have long

1160
00:55:31,699 --> 00:55:34,349
long court cases and in his case

1161
00:55:34,349 --> 00:55:36,089
that will mean at least

1162
00:55:36,089 --> 00:55:38,219
decades in prison contracts

1163
00:55:38,219 --> 00:55:40,519
must and

1164
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:45,829
and in this case it is always

1165
00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:48,169
in

1166
00:55:48,169 --> 00:55:50,459


1167
00:55:50,459 --> 00:55:51,929


1168
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:55,339


1169
00:55:55,339 --> 00:55:59,309
solitary confinement he has no contact to the outside has no contact to other people he is not allowed to talk to the guards in the usa where we have

1170
00:55:59,309 --> 00:56:01,979
to make sure he doesn't

1171
00:56:01,979 --> 00:56:03,959
kill himself that means they wake him up  every

1172
00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:05,959
15 minutes at night he cannot

1173
00:56:05,959 --> 00:56:08,459
sit up or lie down during the

1174
00:56:08,459 --> 00:56:14,209
day is a real form of

1175
00:56:15,229 --> 00:56:18,209
torture am not the only one who

1176

1179
00:56:27,859 --> 00:56:30,859
torture

1180

thanks for that  answer i have one

1181
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:37,099
last question

1182
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:39,319
the big question

1183
00:56:39,319 --> 00:56:42,359
what can society do what has to

1184
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:44,630
happen to prevent extradition

do to prevent the american the effect of the

1188
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,670
american government's

1189
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:56,440
attempts at intimidation against

1190

journalists from my

1191
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:02,020
perspective the us american

1192
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,900
government has to deal with this case

1193
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,820
partying they need to be pressured

1194
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,010
into their own v

1195
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:10,660
on your own

00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:16,680
society on your own press on your own media american society

1198
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,960
you control the political scene

1199
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,180


1200
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:24,130
it is in your own interest that

1201
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:27,040
this is prevented otherwise you

1202
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,830
will lose all your rights

1203
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:32,560
to know what your

1204
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,600
government has to say about the series  you that is

1205
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,330
quite lost the civil

1206
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,070
society

1207
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:41,740
it is very important but also the press

1208
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:44,680
and the mainstream media it would be

1209
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,300
really important if you picked up on

1210
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,490
that

1211
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:49,960
public opinion has to turn around

1212
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:53,410
not only in the usa in australia in

1213
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:55,980
sweden in great britain people everywhere

1214
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:58,540
have to  ask your governments

1215
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,900
why do you accept that a country

1216
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,590
that you are friends with

1217
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:06,810
journalists who are prosecuting the

1218
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:09,790
war crimes uncover we must

1219
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:11,640
ask the people the

1220
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,660
elected representatives of must why

1221
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,690

of that

1236
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:56,759
by the law enforcement agencies in

1237
00:58:56,759 --> 00:59:00,099
swedish authorities to circumvent the

1238

european court of human rights

1239
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:03,579

1244
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,169

that

1248
00:59:21,419 --> 00:59:24,279
the washington post or the new york

1249
00:59:24,279 --> 00:59:26,009
times

1250

1251
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,329

be on board you published this

1255
00:59:44,549 --> 00:59:46,989
case and you want to be factual

1256
00:59:46,989 --> 00:59:48,969
you  need to

1257
00:59:48,969 --> 00:59:50,819
look at the facts

1258
00:59:50,819 --> 00:59:56,619
they need to be a special reporter ha

1259
00:59:56,619 --> 00:59:59,189
ben to

1260
00:59:59,189 --> 01:00:02,429
unbelievable that this has to happen

1261
01:00:02,429 --> 01:00:05,969
this case to be dropped

1262
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:09,459
let go as well that is a scandal in

1263
01:00:09,459 --> 01:00:12,539
20 years of journalism my experience

1264
01:00:12,539 --> 01:00:14,819
as a journalist

1265
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:17,799
15 years of investigative journalism i

1266
01:00:17,799 --> 01:00:20,130
have never heard anything like this from a

1267
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:21,900
media organization

1268
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,429


1269
01:00:23,429 --> 01:00:26,619
letting go of this investigation for eleven years

1270
01:00:26,619 --> 01:00:31,529
i  don't think it will happen,

1271
01:00:31,589 --> 01:00:34,169
just that it only appeared in

1272
01:00:34,169 --> 01:00:36,999
grieth but not

1273
01:00:36,999 --> 01:00:41,968
that it was a media organization

1274
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:45,279
journalist like him the media were

1275
01:00:45,279 --> 01:00:46,289


1276
01:00:46,289 --> 01:00:49,310
journalists here from wikileaks

1277
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:52,340
we have to completely corrupt the legal process the

1278
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,190
legal process

1279
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:59,240
it's like it depends on us  to take

1280
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,950
to the streets and

1281
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:06,440
get press attention the media

1282
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,380
civil journalists whatever we

1283
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:13,130
have to mobilize people to take

1284
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:15,890
to the streets to expose this

1285
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:18,700
terrible injustice to

1286
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,530


1287
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:24,610
make the big film more directly

1288
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:27,070
about this monstrous

1289
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:30,070
injustice

1290
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:32,630
if i can say one more sentence about

1291
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:35,560
to sum up our statement

1292
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:39,470
doesn't think that's the only case it can

1293
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:42,700
happen that's just the tip of the

1294
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,350
iceberg i've written a book

1295
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:47,120
about it not just because it's the

1296
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,190
only case that's the case

1297
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:51,200
that it mostly makes most visible what

1298
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,120
happens  is actually a

1299
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,580
keyhole through which you can see

1300
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:58,550
into a parallel world exists where

1301
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:00,250
democracy and the rule of law

1302
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,410
undermined

1303
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:05,390
questioned does not believe

1304
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:08,150
that this public news

1305
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:11,510
question asks asks questions questions has

1306
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:14,890
proved who has which

1307
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:19,130
interests to know what the powerful masses are doing

1308
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:22,370
with their  power and that's important that

1309
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:24,530
's really at the core of it and i

1310
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:26,290
hope that it was just two

1311
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:29,470
my person

1312
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:32,690
