am very happy that i can be here today

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,080
on the topic of working together

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,300
digitally volunteering is back in the city and

34
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,000
in the country and i am very happy

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,610


36
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,830
to be able to talk to daniel and felix about it because you two are standing

37
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,050
actually exactly for the fact that you make digital engagement possible in

38
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,170
rural areas but also in the city

39
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,730
with

40
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,250
your spaces and that is basically a

41
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,110
very special thing that our foundation, which is

42
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,970
also located in rural areas in

43
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,300
neustrelitz, also promotes and it is

44
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,530
probably not known to everyone that

45
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,420
this foundation is relatively new

46
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,310
and has been around for exactly a year and a half

47
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,990
a year ago we were also having

48
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,750
long discussions we were still

49
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,970
very young so to speak, still in the process of being born,

50
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,010
so to speak we

51
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,930
have stabilized a bit and we

52
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,250
are a foundation  which was founded by three

53
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,840
ministries that

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,000
's something very special that means

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,229
the  The federal government

56
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,600
attaches great importance to the topic of sectors in its office

57
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,090
and it provides us with 30

58
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,010
million euros a year so that we can

59
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,540


60
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,070


61
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,680
support the voluntary commitment

62
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,540
of around 30 million volunteers

63
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,100
throughout Germany, especially in structurally weak and rural areas,

64
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,600
if  now you hear 30 million

65
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,820
volunteers 30 million euros you can add

66
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,260
up that quickly it's one

67
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,600
euro for each volunteer that's why we take a

68
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,270
very close look at where we can support and where

69
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,640
we

70
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,920
can achieve leverage and in felix and

71
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,230
daniel i think we've found two

72
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,930
partners  who do this wonderfully in their

73
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,209
practice every day with

74
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,910
their voluntary work i don't know

75
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,190
how many hours that is for you per

76
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,930
month per week will definitely be added

77
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,610
in the conversation but

78
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,840
maybe a few more words about the

79
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,170
foundation the foundation has a full

80
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,390
mandate  in general, the commitment

81
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,040
nationwide z  u support there

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,100
are volunteer fire

83
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,650


84
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,330


85
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,610


86
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,500


87
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,000
brigades the sports clubs there are social projects in the city and in the country it is totally diverse what is also important to us as a foundation and what was written to us, so to speak, our establishment

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,519
law is also the topic of digitization

89
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,500
in view

90
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,640
last year, in our

91
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,720
founding year, we were able to support around 2,500

92
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,160
non-profit organizations on

93
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,750
the path towards

94
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,060
digitization have supported them with

95
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,860
20 million euros that they created

96
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,510
really wonderful projects

97
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,890
have gone further this year

98
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,570
and I would like to

99
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,370
talk to both of you now about what

100
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,620
will actually be needed in the future not

101
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,269
only for funding programs but also for

102
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,670
support format of recognition

103
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,739
formats that the topic of digital

104
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,480
commitment what he however the congress

105
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,850
so the digital society so that

106
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,500
it can function better so that

107
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,299
it can better r  basic conditions what

108
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:58,980
does it take and i think it's

109
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,570
really nice that

110
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,700
we can look at it from two perspectives

111
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,450
maybe there are differences

112
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,890
maybe there are more

113
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,230
things in common and that's why i

114
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,360
would like to ask you felix

115
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,820
what actually made you do it

116
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,590
to found the x1 you are sitting

117
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,510
in friedrichshain in the middle of berlin, which

118
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,130
also has structurally weak regions in

119
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,608
germany

120
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,769
here again what the objective was

121
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,110
behind it and what role commitment actually

122
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,370
plays your fear it

123
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,270
might scare us actually

124
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,820
was that the original reason

125
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,590
to found an ex association yes a totally

126
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,889
selfish i wanted to learn the cool stuff

127
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:39,440
which i couldn't well well it

128
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,330
's kind of interesting 3d troops i

129
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,320
would have liked to have

130
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,080
learned another programming language and i

131
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,270
can't at all at home alone with

132
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,340
books or somehow youtube tutorials

133
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,259
something  learn that suits me  not at all

134
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:52,820
i'm someone who

135
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,979
learns things by doing and

136
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:56,270
at that moment

137
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,880
i thought well then i just need a room where

138
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,199
i can go where all the people

139
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,870
who can do the cool stuff

140
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,250
and i'm sorry can come  I can learn from

141
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,340
them and there wasn’t a suitable one

142
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,650
within my reach at the moment,

143
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,180
so I decided I’ll

144
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,669
just do it myself up and down then

145
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:16,580
on the one hand I’ve learned a lot of stuff I

146
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,570
still haven’t learned any other

147
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,130
programming language but I’ve learned a

148
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,810
lot of other things too

149
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,240
I quickly noticed that I'm not

150
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,210
the only one who finds it more fun,

151
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,590
not alone at home but

152
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,560
somehow to learn or try something out,

153
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,000
but actually a relatively large number of

154
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,680
people are looking for one room and where they have the opportunity

155
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,020


156
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,760
to talk

157
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,470
or exchange ideas  you can also find devices and machines that you

158
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,110
don't have at home or are

159
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,240
not allowed to use  too loud or

160
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,479
too much dirt and then I just

161
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:49,729
found out that if you make an

162
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:52,669
effort you can reach a relatively large number of

163
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:55,430
people and they can be very happy

164
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,349
and if you notice that people are

165
00:05:57,349 --> 00:05:58,880
somehow totally happy because they

166
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,130
can do what you actually

167
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,080
thought they could do  once this space is thought of

168
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,409
then it

169
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:07,639
is very satisfying and as a result it

170
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,800
has

171
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,139
become the majority of my

172
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,720
free time not to worry about the x1

173
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,250
so we have

174
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,550
grown from zero to over 100 members in five and a half years

175
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,110
but in

176
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,810
between from 40 square meters to

177
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,150
200  square meters moved to the house

178
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,150
next door

179
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,220
and even now it's like that, you

180
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,780
think maybe you could use a

181
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,780
few more square meters,

182
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,750
so there's a total need for

183
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,730
these possibilities to be able to let off steam and exchange ideas in a

184
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,160
creative, artistic, technical way

185
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,490
, and yes, we

186
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,050
are  here in the middle of berlin but so

187
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,850
many great locations  there is no ns for that

188
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,440
and that was exactly the

189
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,910
reason why i am still there now

190
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,920
and also have no desire to

191
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,510
stop somehow but

192
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,880
actually would like to continue it

193
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,830
is a great example of what

194
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,000
actually constitutes a willing commitment

195
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,500
namely the

196
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,170
starting to sing your own to watch

197
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,060
something to create something i mean the 100

198
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,620
members here meanwhile has what

199
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,660
speaks for it not only that there is a

200
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,790
need but that the people

201
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,770
also want to create something but what role

202
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,360
does it play if i briefly ask the

203
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,900
question again which  the role is played by the

204
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,100
topic of honorary evening engagement wurst said you

205
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,070
spend a lot of time in your space

206
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,480
but what about the others i

207
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,280
have read your page yes there are also so

208
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,840
-called mentors who are their

209
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,060
official who help new members

210
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,890
to find their way around initiating projects

211
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,290
yes so basically we have  here only

212
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,630
volunteers we currently have

213
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,250
not a single one  employees here,

214
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,220
but they all only do it in their

215
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,310
free time and by the way,

216
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,050
insofar as this whole space

217
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,650
is not possible without voluntary work,

218
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,330
yes, there are people who spend more time here

219
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,130
than others and, for example

220
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,410
, take on the task of welcoming new

221
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,790
people here and

222
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,350
there a little  a little bit of the

223
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,820
fear of getting into

224
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,680
a room full of

225
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,690
people you don't know or devices

226
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,810
that you might be afraid of and

227
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,800
feel a bit uncomfortable,

228
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,440
so we clearly have our

229
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,390
crew mentors

230
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,710
somehow on this one too  chaos games a

231
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,900
bit oriented there is also this

232
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,990
project that you offer

233
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,740
a bit of an introduction to get people to do so

234
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,380
because

235
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,640
if you don't take

236
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,289
good care of newcomers and have a bit of a

237
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,650
welcoming culture then

238
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,030
you're right  yes also quickly back

239
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,330
out as a community so

240
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,970
that's just very important and like

241
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,130
gesa  gt so no one here

242
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,600
gets paid so at the moment it's all just

243
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,330
voluntary here a voluntary project

244
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,160
and so the world i come

245
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,570
from volunteer management with the

246
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,060
mentors and godparents that's great

247
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,310
new people are supported in their

248
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,440
engagement that's a good thing  model

249
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,690
daniel how was it with you

250
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,490
not exactly sitting in the city of millions he

251
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,710
is sitting in the fürstenberghaus on the way

252
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,150
to neustrelitz i have to say

253
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,670
and i founded the havel there as an

254
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,560
association what were they moving at the time and

255
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,950
for you and a fellow campaigner it was

256
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,200
with us  the motives were

257
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,030
initially similar or at least

258
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,630
similar to felix we came

259
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,180
out here in 2011 and before that i spent

260
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,830
almost 15 years in different

261
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,930
cities, most recently in berlin, where

262
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,870
there was always some experience, so

263
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,510
other people who were organized in this community

264
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,900
here and  more or

265
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,580
less spaces had created

266
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,840
themselves at least once

267
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,960
reg  regular meetings and stuff like that and

268
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,790
there was nothing out

269
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,290


270
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,000


271
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,160


272
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,190
here that i somehow missed so is a wonderful life here in fürstenberg or the only downside was that there is

273
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,390
no such place here so i

274
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,800
didn’t have anything in the workshop

275
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,720
or  a place where i could say

276
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,610
that people who are also interested in these topics can

277
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,990
somehow

278
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,100
meet and therefore there was also

279
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,990
this very intrinsic motivation for

280
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,260
me to create as myself and

281
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,630
at the same time it is of course so

282
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,880
that everything around me  outside of this

283
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,470
there is no offer here at

284
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,320
all so neither for young people

285
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,270
i also went to chaos macht

286
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,950
school for a while because i was very committed and also

287
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,960
with youth somehow and we

288
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,420
then found out very brutally

289
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,070
that actually out here it’s a

290
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,740
completely different reality  takes place than in

291
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,900
the perhaps more modern and

292
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,880
higher schools in berlin  finds

293
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,470
or in the whole context of a city where

294
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,209
you can at least find such offers for young people

295
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:48,089
and so it

296
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:49,980
was somehow relatively natural that

297
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,779
we said we will also create this

298
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,879
place so that then what the

299
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:56,489
young people can get in and that it closes

300
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,249
there is also a gap here on site

301
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:01,439
and similar to x1, everything is done on a

302
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:03,359
voluntary basis. last year we had

303
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:04,609


304
00:11:04,609 --> 00:11:06,259
a

305
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:07,410
federal volunteer who

306
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,199
was our only paid employee

307
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:12,359
, but she has now been

308
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:13,279


309
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,249
out of her job for two weeks and back

310
00:11:17,249 --> 00:11:19,439
into freedom  and the daughter sits on the

311
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:21,209
other side of the camera in the director's office

312
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:23,179
and works again on a voluntary basis, so of

313
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:25,199
course it's all about volunteering here for us

314
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:29,069
and that's

315
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:30,600
actually the nice thing about it,

316
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,059
so I think it's really great

317
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,160
because in the end it means that  the people

318
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,169
who are here come in

319
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:38,359
here with a different

320
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:40,350


321
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,449
concern and have a different one  h

322
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:43,799
involve here so there is nobody here who

323
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:46,439
leaves his job or comes in from her in the

324
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,119
morning because he is paid for it and

325
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:50,549
has to be here or something like that, but the people

326
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:52,470
who are there and who help out here,

327
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,660
even with the totally crazy

328
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,699
expansion projects or

329
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:58,109
new things that come to our minds  or so they

330
00:11:58,109 --> 00:12:00,089
're all here because they really

331
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:02,519
want it and that's also a different

332
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,759
kind of working together

333
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:08,339
and that all sounds really good

334
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:09,779
but i know how it is in engagement

335
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,279
engagement there are of

336
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,230
course also problems what would you say

337
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,089
that  would you two say that

338
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:17,160
your challenge do you think there

339
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,679
are differences so what you do

340
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,079
is very similar but death from the

341
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,519
different regions

342
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,739
yes i would be very interested

343
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:27,509
to know what the challenges are on the outside i

344
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:29,279
know of many large associations

345
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,199
that also unite foundations that you

346
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:32,609
For example, they have immense problems recruiting young people

347
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:35,759
that they are groaning

348
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,279
because of bureaucracy  s stresses

349
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,449
that you have as a non-profit

350
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:42,019
organization felix you are organized as a GmbH

351
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:44,999
here daniel as an association nonetheless

352
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:46,859
you probably have similar

353
00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:48,869
challenges or is it also the

354
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:50,970
financial the financial possibility

355
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,070
that you have as a non-profit

356
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,480
organization to also apply for funding

357
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,290


358
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,120
let’s just have a look  talk briefly about

359
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,130
how the situation is where you

360
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,769
sow the challenge max at the

361
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:04,320
beginning so maybe very briefly from

362
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,570
my side here with us the

363
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,639
challenge well one of the

364
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,470
challenges are definitely people

365
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,139
so I thought long and

366
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,790
hard about

367
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,470
what I measure with at the beginning  now actually the success

368
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,240
so if we build something like this here we

369
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,040
have given our three years to

370
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,920
say to determine whether it is

371
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,019
worth running this place here and investing

372
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,699
all the work again rhine flows

373
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:28,889
and then we

374
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:30,389
asked ourselves what actually is  somehow the

375
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:32,279
metric  somehow you do it with

376
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,870
numbers a lot of support

377
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,820
programs that we are also involved with, for example

378
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,040
, only the sponsors they want

379
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,600
to have numbers somehow how many

380
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,880
young people come on how many days a

381
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,070
year and so on that's a

382
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,680
bad metric actually because first of all

383
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,240
here in the country there are of course

384
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,800
far fewer young people there

385
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,810
are other ways that have to be

386
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,490
bridged so it is also

387
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,100
much more complicated for us to get to the train station

388
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,079
at the

389
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,459
same time for the young people who come to

390
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,680
us this is just the place that was

391
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,990
missing so we have  here young

392
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,920
people who are at the end of

393
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,089


394
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:11,160
the day here at least once a week with their own key

395
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,850
, some of them somehow come 30 35

396
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,260
minutes by car here with the

397
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,870
parents' taxi somehow drove up here and

398
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,220
live with some dump in the

399
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,110
lake district

400
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,760
where there is nothing  they are interested

401
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,980
and even if you don't have just five

402
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,329
young people like that, they have the hi  he are very

403
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:29,339
regular is that for these young

404
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,949
people I think the offer is that the place makes the

405
00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:33,690
right difference for their

406
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,120
life path i hope at least close and

407
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,910
at the same time it is natural

408
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,190
that in the medium term you have to see

409
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,899
how it somehow develops

410
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:46,589
and we are very keen on that  in

411
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:49,199
cooperation with the elementary school, so we

412
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,490
have an afternoon group

413
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,870
or actually three

414
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,580
afternoon groups

415
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,380
during the week where the kids come after

416
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,210
school and since they are all

417
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,800
elementary school students somewhere between

418
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,110
third and sixth grade,

419
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,880
i think they grow quite well in this space

420
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,230
in here so i think that in the

421
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,420
medium term everyone, if

422
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,880
not more, will

423
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,620
continue to frequent this place here and grow in here and

424
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,260
bring in their own

425
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,300
ideas that they wish

426
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,520
for in a place like this and that this

427
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,410
will also change over the next few years  really good

428
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,210
and parts will also develop at

429
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,380
one  way that i couldn't plan at all

430
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,990


431
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,000
and found out that one side

432
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,130
and otherwise of course everything

433
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,290
that has to do with bureaucracy is always

434
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,390
difficult so i'm not a bureaucrat at all

435
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,480
i hate paperwork and above

436
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,240
all i get annoyed every time i have

437
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,730
time  which I would actually spend with

438
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,270
my engagement here

439
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,740
on having to sacrifice in order

440
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,150
to do any accounting or

441
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,320
somehow organize all this overhead

442
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,660
and unfortunately I have

443
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,310
n't found anyone who wants to take it off

444
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,570
, so I'm confident

445
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,820
that at some point somewhere he'll

446
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,040
be happy to do it  but we don't have the people

447
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,180
at the moment and

448
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,120
we're struggling with that a bit

449
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,800
that's nice felix sees it with you

450
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,570
and what are your challenges or

451
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,850
your solution methods for the challenge

452
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,660
yes, in a certain way it's also

453
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,760
a 1 1 people  problem maybe

454
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,290
not like hold in Fürstenberg that there is so

455
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,090
little and you just about anything  how friends

456
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,770
have to make friends when five people

457
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,560
show up regularly

458
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,570
it's more about the fact that it's

459
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,250
more like a communal

460
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,670
hobby room here and

461
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,140
everyone else earns their money somewhere else

462
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,510
, sometimes it's much more

463
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,100
difficult to find people who are willing

464
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,530
to offer workshops  always

465
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,510
once for a one-time yes of course but

466
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,950
somehow to say that you

467
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:48,180
regularly do workshops this is

468
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,340
just difficult again or just of course

469
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,630
somehow everything that is

470
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,120
administrative overhead nobody really wants to

471
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,850
do that

472
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,100
I'm glad that we are now together as a

473
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,110
couple  are and I can already give away a large part of

474
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,110
it.

475
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,760
That's definitely the classic problem, I think, if you want to do something that

476
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,970


477
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,520
you want to do and also have a little

478
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,849
bit of space,

479
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:15,439
because you could maybe

480
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,939


481
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:18,349
do workshops for school classes and so on if  you can accommodate a complete

482
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,689
school class but yes

483
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:22,609
we have  en although now a total of 200

484
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,010
square meters here on two floors but to have fun with

485
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,020
a complete school class with 25

486
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,780
children here at the same time

487
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,720
that doesn't work out space technically alone

488
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,179
with us that's a problem that

489
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,289
it's probably much bigger with us

490
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:39,409
than with daniel in the country we

491
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:41,630
would  getting kids there they

492
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,000
don't have to drive 35 minutes by car

493
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,710
, it may

494
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,320
also take 35 minutes by s-bahn or subway, although

495
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,600
it's the same city, but in

496
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,909
fact our biggest problem here is

497
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:54,650
space or

498
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,530
the possibility of paying for space  so

499
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,740
it's not like there aren't any

500
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,840
other areas, but of

501
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,860
course we're here in the heart of

502
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,860
friedrichshain,

503
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,669
moving is almost impossible,

504
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:11,900
especially because we don't

505
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,820
somehow pay our rent from funding pots

506
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,490
, but

507
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,929
for funding programs, like yours already

508
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:19,130
said, we usually make money somehow

509
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,240
would have to and so and so many

510
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,250
workshops and that's exactly what's a

511
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,110
bit difficult for us  ig that's why we finance

512
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,150
ourselves with a bit of rental income and

513
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,159
mostly donations and from that

514
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:34,250
to pay for a new location in Berlin

515
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,530
that's the biggest challenge, so to speak

516
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,169
, especially since the battery is now also

517
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:41,480
drawing otherwise we would need more

518
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,659
workshops so that we can introduce more people here

519
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:47,530
and make them happy,

520
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,970
but there  corinna is also unfortunately still playing a spanner in the works for

521
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,770


522
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,380
us i would just like to

523
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,780
check again so on the one hand just not

524
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,460
that a misunderstanding has arisen

525
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,169
so we have here in our

526
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:02,090
regular offers something

527
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,909
between 20 and 25 young people who

528
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:08,309
actually once  in the week there are

529
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:10,470


530
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,140
reliably yes and in addition we have school classes, so due to corona it was

531
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,669
not possible now but we

532
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:17,010
have also had school classes from other parts of the

533
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,780
republic who

534
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,919
, for example, simply

535
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,720
rented a place at the campsite for a

536
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,820
week  and at other weeks in

537
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,530
our workshop  and we somehow did some

538
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,500
action with us so

539
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,059
we don't have this problem i would

540
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,490
just wanted it with the numbers in the

541
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,750
sense that we had far too few

542
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,429
people or something like that but i just wanted to

543
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:38,070
say the metric by which you can measure

544
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,840
that is on  the country is different because the

545
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,280
target groups are maybe much

546
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,159
smaller and maybe building

547
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:46,289
on what felix just said, also with the

548
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:48,299
rent one thing that just came to my

549
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,090
mind and that is really

550
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,280
very important

551
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,600
what is generally missing in the whole

552
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,950
funding landscape is such

553
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,280
structural funding  yes, it is

554
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,860
really relatively easy for us comparatively

555
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,350
easy to raise investment funds

556
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,409
somewhere that if i tell someone

557
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:09,240
i have something new planned i have

558
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,630
a specific project here somehow

559
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,760
then i can very easily

560
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,190
acquire funding for potters because everyone

561
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,720
wants to finance something new but it is quite

562
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,700
extremely difficult to raise funds

563
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,370
when I don't know what I have  e what

564
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,500
works, what needs to be preserved

565
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,080
and i have these problems and not just us

566
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,549
, it exists in the whole

567
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:31,650
field of engagement and i think we should

568
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,590
think about why we

569
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,929
don’t put this focus differently

570
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:39,570
and whether it wouldn’t be important that we have

571
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,890
certain desirable

572
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,230
social  structures and

573
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,390
they are somehow football clubs or

574
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,820
sports structures just like what we

575
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,400
both do here

576
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,780
that they also benefit from the structure

577
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,240
financing

578
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,130
because they all

579
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,159
suffer from the same problems it is

580
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,150
becoming increasingly difficult

581
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,309


582
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:04,260
to finance things through membership fees to

583
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,330
maintain structures and at the same time need them  we have

584
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,100
these structures and that's why i think i

585
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,120
need a kind of

586
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,010
structural funding and a change

587
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,350
in this funding landscape. there must not

588
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,940
only be something new with this project idea

589
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,710
, but above all the

590
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,920
preservation of structures that are worth preserving

591
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,160
must somehow be included in the  back focus

592
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,480
that is definitely a sore point

593
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,800
garnier that we have already

594
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,410
noticed that the federal

595
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,180
foundation are also

596
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,220
currently still tied to the

597
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,840
so-called annual kite when allocating

598
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,370
our funding that there is nothing that we came up with that there is more or

599
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,640
less like

600
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,170
that they give like that  framework but

601
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,060
what we are trying to do we have the

602
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,360
topic of strengthening the structure also in our

603
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,550
statutes are in the direction of

604
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,290
law we are trying to be

605
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,810
sustainable in networks with small projects in the country

606
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,160
but only the

607
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,710
municipality should be involved that if

608
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,940
I want one too  my subsequent question

609
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,310
is trying to

610
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,570
build up the structures that support civic

611
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,270
engagement in its area and of

612
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,590
course we don’t want to do that just for a

613
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,500
year but for several years,

614
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,330
we don’t ask ourselves, however,

615
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,830
should we as a foundation do something like that,

616
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,600
so we’re happy to talk to

617
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,610
you about it here too  also considered in the

618
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,080
coalition agreement  it says that the

619
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,160
German Foundation for Voluntary Engagement

620
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,570
should be strengthened,

621
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,700
especially in its funding rope, which we think is

622
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,800
very good, but how can we do

623
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,380
it with 6 over 600,000 association over

624
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,180
20,000 foundations i don't know how

625
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,500
many gse gss cetera pp there

626
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,240
really is a good structure here  Strengthening

627
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,570
what we do is investing in scaling

628
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,000
, so to speak, good good

629
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,190
programs projects that have a social

630
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,320
impact that work

631
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,570
and things that you do that help

632
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,580
you to get into the area

633
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,220
you also support the basic structure that's sort of

634
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,020
a

635
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,580
new funding logic around you we would be

636
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,610
happy if there were others with us

637
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:59,640
so that they think along with a

638
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,140
strict is not only state

639
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,290
funding is driven there is

640
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,480
the municipality that is often clamped,

641
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,430
especially in structurally weak areas,

642
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,380
voluntary commitment is often one

643
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,420
so-called voluntary performance

644
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,310
I must also first le  But I would

645
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,290
like to ask you again how is it

646
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,970
in your municipality, so the city of Berlin

647
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,550
and

648
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,940
Fürstenberg do you get support there,

649
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,250
so we have not quite deliberately

650
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,480
applied for any yet

651
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,010
, here there is club

652
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,960
funding as probably

653
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,210
in most  other municipalities too and

654
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,130
the club funding amounts to

655
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,770
a maximum of 5000 euros over

656
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:42,040
three years so that's that's what

657
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,510
we have in terms of fixed costs it

658
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,640
doesn't really get us very far and

659
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,590
we've held it back a

660
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,140
bit at the moment

661
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,790
so that we  in the event that we

662
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,740
really need the

663
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,919
city to have it as an ace up our sleeve

664
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:01,030
at the same time, the billing process is

665
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,950
also relatively complicated, it has

666
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,660
to be applied for with a lot of joy

667
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,700
, then

668
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,410
you are not allowed to start with certain things before they

669
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,929
have been approved in some way  and that

670
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:12,669
's why we haven't used it at the

671
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:14,799
moment, i

672
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,900
know  s that at least and that is

673
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,400
also something we

674
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,840
have been working towards

675
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,910
that it is now relatively clear in the city that this place

676
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,100
offers added value yes and that is

677
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,870
also very important to us we wanted to create this place

678
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,610
independently so that we do

679
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,410
n’t end up in such a  we have to start a discussion

680
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,900
about whether it's really needed and

681
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,150
whether it's worth putting a bit of

682
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,669
municipal money on top of it,

683
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:41,020
no one would have wanted to have this discussion

684
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,059
, which is why we said we'll

685
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:44,860
build it up first, we'll show

686
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,600
that it has added value, that it's

687
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,640
accepted here in  the city that that is

688
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,710
that needs and then you

689
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,490
have a different basis for

690
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,230
negotiating in the future when it comes to

691
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:57,000
support from the municipality

692
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:00,549
it's similar for us we do

693
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:02,559
n't get any funding from the

694
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,900
municipality if only because we

695
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,850
haven't since  were non-profit at the beginning

696
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,890
but are only now

697
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,750
non-profit in 2019, which means that he

698
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,480
did not really work before  I offered

699
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,559
up until then I had run the x1 as a

700
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,179
small business owner because there was

701
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:19,960
actually no chance of

702
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,919
funding programs and

703
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:24,600
I actually didn’t dare to really go into the city

704
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,429


705
00:25:26,429 --> 00:25:27,869
because I have to say it was also our

706
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:30,480
contact with the city of Berlin during the

707
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,999
first one  lok downs last year unfortunately

708
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:35,700
very unpleasant because we were the

709
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,679


710
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,830
first of the game and also produced

711
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,570


712
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,309
and distributed masks and

713
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,470
tried to get to the Berlin state administration

714
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,330
several times in order to

715
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,429
possibly get money from them

716
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:52,080
so that we can somehow

717
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,169
do things more and faster and

718
00:25:55,169 --> 00:25:57,769
have been flashed for weeks

719
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:00,389
that we

720
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:01,859
finally got my answer at some point

721
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:04,200
and it was like you

722
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,059
want to sell us masks what should

723
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:07,919
the costs be we buy them then  we

724
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,419
said no, we don't want to sell you masks

725
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,609
, we want to  We were happy to distribute masks for

726
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:14,070
free and they

727
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,230
replied to us that the non-profit is

728
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,139
not relevant before that and that was the end of the

729
00:26:19,139 --> 00:26:21,419
topic and that's what

730
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:23,429
we really tried to get in touch for weeks

731
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:26,159
in all possible

732
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,749
ways and somehow you could

733
00:26:27,749 --> 00:26:29,489
on twitter  read that the state

734
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:31,139
deputies are somehow tweeting that

735
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:32,879
's great what we're doing and that

736
00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:35,009
you should support it but in the

737
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:37,169
end we didn't see a cent

738
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:39,210
or a thank you or anything

739
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,190
there and that didn't really

740
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,100
encourage us and somehow got along with us

741
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,480
funding programs right now to the state of

742
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,230
berlin

743
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:51,179
thank you for the openness of our

744
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:54,539
talk means working together and acting

745
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:56,369
really quickly this year and

746
00:26:56,369 --> 00:26:58,169
actually the project with the face

747
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:01,080
now was that was that was that too

748
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,220
so that you somehow

749
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,869
developed it together  you and there were

750
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:06,629
other men spaces with impressed

751
00:27:06,629 --> 00:27:08,730
us a b  isschen has to tell

752
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:12,320
so i think it's

753
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,669
hard to say now that we developed it together because

754
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:16,830
we sent versions back and forth

755
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,899
in the meantime but in the end it was so that

756
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:20,879
here with his couple of people we already

757
00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:22,320
started using a fabric mask

758
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,869
and then daniel asked hey

759
00:27:24,869 --> 00:27:27,179
me  somehow needed someone to

760
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,279
supply the doctors in berlin with fixed ones

761
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,739
you can’t even and half an

762
00:27:31,739 --> 00:27:33,480
hour later the first test print on

763
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,639
the 3d printer and that’s when it

764
00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:39,250
started then it wasn’t at all so they didn’t develop this

765
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,700
but then we were

766
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,910
in  cooperation even with the chaos raised a

767
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,820
lot more firmly and also

768
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,790
more fabric masks and all that

769
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,920
distributed everywhere so

770
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,420
we built up a network together pretty quickly

771
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,790


772
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,940
but yes we developed the festivals

773
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,440
exactly but i would say that it

774
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,780
was precisely this thing with  the fans of the

775
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,670
game have had a super good

776
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:10,120
success story like a

777
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,510
couple of open who  kstätten in the state of

778
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,160
brandenburg yes, above all we

779
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,750
have the network open workshops in

780
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,580
brandenburg that is a really good

781
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,520
network where very different

782
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,470
such faces are networked across the state of

783
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,200
brandenburg together

784
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,690
with the x1 kaders and the beuth uni in

785
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,820
berlin made common cause

786
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,940
and within

787
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,520
five weeks or so we somehow transferred from a

788
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,490
decentralized 3d printing production to

789
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:42,520
an industrial injection

790
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,250
molding and we always distributed a total of

791
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,520
almost 25,000 such shields in

792
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,620
brandenburg and in berlin,

793
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,790
so i even ended up with some

794
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:55,660
in the congo  clever somehow and that

795
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,090
was really a

796
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,610
really good example of how everyone was

797
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,800
volunteering under lockdown conditions in their free time

798
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,270
and so were

799
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,650
able to

800
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,090
set something up together that the market just did

801
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,730
n't regulate at all, so that's why it's

802
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,290
a  super good example I think

803
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,330
what happened and  what becomes possible

804
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,400
when a few people get together

805
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,590
i also think that this is a wonderful

806
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,150
example of how working together

807
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,910
can work and what role

808
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,530
commitment simply has and how much

809
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,690
faster and more creative it often

810
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,220
is and that that just needs

811
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,600
support we have each other  Yes,

812
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,430
a few points have already been mentioned as to

813
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,110
how funding policy, state

814
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,240
funding policy, in particular, but

815
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,560
perhaps also private-sector

816
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,480
or private foundation law

817
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,180
father policy, should change. Do

818
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,020
you have any other

819
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,980


820
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,900
ideas?  i am the

821
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,030
main board member of de i was also

822
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,920
at the foundation which had to travel frankly

823
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,360
itself i know how difficult this

824
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,059
business is and

825
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,350
from my point of view the topic of the project does not make a

826
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,600
lot of sense it is usually sensible

827
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,270
to state things definitely that is that

828
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,660
is also  just something well

829
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,250
something fuel that  But

830
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,870
on the other hand, it's good when something

831
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,250
effective and when you see

832
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,320
that organizations come together

833
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,450
and manage to provide help within a very short time,

834
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,950
like what we just mentioned as an

835
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,660
example,

836
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,880
what effects

837
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,300
do you want from a future

838
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,470
funding policy  also with regard

839
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,330
to digital engagement in particular,

840
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,870
our topic here is what do you see what is

841
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:36,530
needed what needs to change

842
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,940
i would very much wish that this

843
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,000
whole topic around digital

844
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,030
projects in the voluntary sector would be

845
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,530
even better and also a

846
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,880
natural acceptance

847
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,190
thinks well freifunk he is such a typical

848
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,809
example somehow it took a long

849
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:56,940
time until someone understood on an

850
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,340
official site

851
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,250
that the development of freifunk

852
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,030
infrastructures is also a charitable

853
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,280
affair and that applies to a

854
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,590
lot of other work that people from

855
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,450
our community do here in  their

856
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,120
free  so it's about time that this

857
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,970
this this obscure technical

858
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,950
people program something or

859
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,040
somehow operate infrastructures operate

860
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,670
video conference systems

861
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,610
whatever that in this world

862
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,290
of charitable

863
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,780
charitable commitment goes down

864
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,950
without a doubt and is also

865
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,380
recognized as such I think that's

866
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,390
really good and then there's it  for my

867
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,440
heart's

868
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,380
desire that there should be something like a

869
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,000
voluntary digital year

870
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,100
so we have the voluntary

871
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,520
ecological year the social year we

872
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,679
have the federal voluntary service but

873
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,870
it would be just as good and actually also

874
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,330
in the interest of our society that

875
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,679
we people do this

876
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:54,690
young people in particular have an affinity for technology who would like to do something useful

877
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,460
between school and the rest of their

878
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,350
lives

879
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,690
, that they are given the opportunity to

880
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,789
do something with this digital

881
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:03,720
focus and a technical

882
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,999
focus and i think

883
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:07,860
that you  se can also

884
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,799
get this interface that such

885
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,139
people then also go to organizations

886
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,669
that may lack this digital

887
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:16,710
competence and that we get this

888
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,110
interaction from clubs that

889
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,850
actually do something completely different that

890
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,470
has nothing to do with digitization at all

891
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,999
but simply accompany and shape social areas on a

892
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:28,679
voluntary basis

893
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:31,169
that they

894
00:32:31,169 --> 00:32:32,580
will be able to bring a bit of

895
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,200
technical competence on board

896
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,470
and maybe take the step into the

897
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,419
future because that is also

898
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:41,190
a huge problem how do you

899
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,929
support them all like we have it here on site

900
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:45,690
every day or every week

901
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,940
that from the seniors’ association

902
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,409
would like to be supported by us, for example

903
00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:52,200
, to put it in the cloud so

904
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,549
that people can organize

905
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:55,259
it better, can share photos, things like that

906
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:57,659
and everyone else has that

907
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:00,720
too and via a voluntary digital

908
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,279
year I think you could do something like that then

909
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,019
vi  maybe try

910
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:07,110
a bit the other way there

911
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,269
was actually a pilot project 215

912
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:12,659
to 220 that tested the digital

913
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:15,210
voluntary social year at the drk around im

914
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:19,080
brk saxony-anhalt and that gave

915
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,279


916
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,749
rise to small counseling centers but that hasn’t happened yet

917
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,179
what you have now, daniel, we

918
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:25,590
hope and it is also included in the coalition

919
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,740
agreement to strengthen it again and also to

920
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,509
put it in place from our point of view it makes a

921
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:31,740


922
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,320
lot of sense we received 2,500 applications last year, then it was

923
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,139
very often about very low-threshold

924
00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:39,119
things  as far as digitization is concerned,

925
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,679
they simply need a lot of committed people who

926
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:42,539
bring the skills with them and for this

927
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:43,980
, places like the ones you have just

928
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,119
created with your commitment are

929
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:47,690
very important from our perspective

930
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:51,480
felix, what what do we want from

931
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,850
a non-future-

932
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:56,940
oriented funding policy that really digital

933
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,909
commitment  made possible and such places

934
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:02,879
that you also provide  lt of course supports

935
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:04,740
this on the one hand more

936
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,990
structural funding so I would like it

937
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,299
if you didn't suddenly get funding only in the last

938
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,460
quarter

939
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,750


940
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,280
and had to be gone at the end of the year and if you could

941
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,399
somehow approach it a bit calmly and

942
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:19,168
calmly then I think you could use it

943
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:20,179


944
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:22,260
more sustainably  On the one hand that would be

945
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,149
nice and I

946
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:26,280
personally would like to see the topic of digitization,

947
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,250
especially because more children and

948
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,719
young people would like to have it,

949
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,760
that you might get a

950
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,379
little more on the screen that

951
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:36,418
digitization doesn't necessarily just mean

952
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:39,480
programming and computer direct,

953
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,290
that's what it's called  there are also all the

954
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,239
digital artists 3d printing and laser

955
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:48,480
cards and so a mixture of

956
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,399
digitization and almost handicraft

957
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,100
actually what i think that should

958
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,219
somehow also be

959
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,470
on offer for children and

960
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,230
young people because something like i

961
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,610
had back then in school when

962
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,710
work  i think there is

963
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,960
almost no such thing anymore and i

964
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,100
think a lot of things are simply

965
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,380
lost because you have

966
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,180
no point of

967
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,990
contact with it at school so i would

968
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,640
actually like it but like

969
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,590
a

970
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:18,320
communal maker space so not

971
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,510
at all the directly as  educational institution

972
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,970
which is also financed by the respective municipality

973
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:25,470
and where one should possibly make

974
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:28,200
the nice ones you how every

975
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,090
student in the district spends

976
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,220
at least one day per school year here

977
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,220
and can do everything from test

978
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,260
programming to a wood workshop or

979
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,690
just something to hand  take what

980
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,940
you might not be able to do at school

981
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,640
and i don't think you can

982
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,140
expect every school to

983
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,540
build it up itself because it's easy to run a

984
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,870
whole heap of work son max pace

985
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:54,410
and to keep it going and

986
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:58,230
yes the teachers aren't like you either

987
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,120
you have to be halfway up to date, especially in the technical area

988
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,920
, and you

989
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,350
can too  don't ask pedagogues

990
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,000
that the vivendi

991
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,100
have studied another subject then somehow work on it in their

992
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,870
free time in addition to

993
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,490
preparing lessons so that they can

994
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,020
then offer ag in the respective school

995
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,370
.

996
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,650
my big wish would be a solidly

997
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:20,630
financed municipal amec space

998
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,760
for adults too, but with one  focus on

999
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,250
children and young people

1000
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,630
that sounds good too and it

1001
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,190
sounds even more so if i will be together

1002
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,690
because something like this can of course not just

1003
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,190
come from the club, for example

1004
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,600
, but you need

1005
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,640
many players for that, i.e. the

1006
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,710
municipality, so we think  that does

1007
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,850
not always help from the

1008
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,680
federal government somewhere model project somewhere but it

1009
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,960
has to come from below and also

1010
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,390
be supported locally we would of

1011
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,890
course also like to support

1012
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,570
again on the subject of subsidies what we

1013
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,920
also do here in the

1014
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,080
community we also advise on

1015
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,120
subject funding search we

1016
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,980
are quite there  active we also have a

1017
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,170
focus on supporting open

1018
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,730
source projects which of course should always have

1019
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,920
concrete connections with the topic of commitment in

1020
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,690
your office,

1021
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,630
which you also have frequently and which i

1022
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,550
would like to recommend to both of you again and

1023
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,410
i don't know if you do it

1024
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:10,950
together with

1025
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,930
there are quite a lot of voluntary agencies in berlin,

1026
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,970
at least you said you are looking

1027
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,320
for people who somehow

1028
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,700
offer shops, regularly and

1029
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,410
reliably, or maybe here in

1030
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,240
the community, so there are

1031
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,790
always offers

1032
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,230
to say that you are

1033
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,850
looking for someone, you don’t know  whether he

1034
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,130
already works with such structures,

1035
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,260
but if you have any issues, feel free to contact

1036
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,710
us and

1037
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,660
feel free to contact us again and help where

1038
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,700
we can, so not only financially

1039
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,590
but also advise that's what I wanted to

1040
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,530
say now  I'll ask if there are any

1041
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:45,690
questions from our viewers or

1042
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:48,470
about shopping,

1043
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,490
yes  in fact there is a question

1044
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,370
, namely the suggestion

1045
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,840
that schools and other

1046
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,520
public institutions could be persuaded to make

1047
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,820
empty rooms in space and

1048
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,680
similar available and

1049
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,850
whether you

1050
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,770
think this is a sensible solution and if so how to do it

1051
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,759
best approach

1052
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,120
now know the room situation i would say

1053
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,710
secondary schools here in

1054
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,300
berlin not so well but when i look

1055
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,040
at how it is in the elementary schools

1056
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,840
here it is just

1057
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,180
difficult to find an empty room in

1058
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,520
a school in berlin at least he

1059
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,210
doesn’t deserve it yet  there is a planned use

1060
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,599
so i would say in

1061
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,500
general it is not a

1062
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,940
bad idea at first so if there is a space

1063
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:40,030
for it then it would probably be a very good possibility

1064
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,910
to open such spaces for people who

1065
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,530
then go in and play in the major space

1066
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,410


1067
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:51,099
so how  everyone has something of it then

1068
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:52,990
what felix said that it

1069
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,150
is difficult to expect that from teachers or  he

1070
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,680
teachers that you are now building up the

1071
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,570
neckar space in the school that

1072
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,050
it is a very realistic problem

1073
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,859
at the same time you could maybe

1074
00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:06,280
create the synergy effects and

1075
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,740
bring people to the school who would

1076
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,109
get closer to the students and

1077
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:12,520
i could well imagine that but  i

1078
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,470
'm also not really sure if we will be empty in

1079
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,500
the time next to in the schools so

1080
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,349


1081
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:21,460
that's even out here in the country

1082
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,460
i don't really think ursus who but

1083
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,570
so horrible in my opinion really

1084
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,040
a nice concept also

1085
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,720
because there would be the possibility  the fact that you could perhaps just give

1086
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,470
the students

1087
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,940
a little bit of the design

1088
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,220
and organization of the respective max

1089
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,609
bases in their

1090
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:42,010
own hands would be nice who makes such a

1091
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,980
room so that would be a really good way of

1092
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,160
getting close to a potentially

1093
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,730
very thankful target group

1094
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,960
so i know that there is also a lot of discussion about

1095
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,530
places of engagement, above

1096
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,910
all  to create in rural areas

1097
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,080
i wanted to do it somehow so that

1098
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,270
non-profit organizations don't come

1099
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,589
together at all there are no

1100
00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:04,450
networks even though you're together in a village

1101
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:06,640
there's no idea 567

1102
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,710
clubs the 1000 don't get along

1103
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,820
because there's no longer that kind

1104
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,700
in the middle of the village there is no

1105
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,560
culture center or there isn't even

1106
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,240
my village pub or something like that but it works he

1107
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,800
set up village pubs and I think there

1108
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,410
are many, many places in rural

1109
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,420
areas than in urban areas that lead to

1110
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,240
such places, well, to such places of

1111
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,920
commitment  be that digital

1112
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,390
engagement is also classic engagement

1113
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,220
so big beat and meeting rooms

1114
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,170
can be created and

1115
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,000
we also find that interesting, especially with the

1116
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,520
order to support voluntary engagement in

1117
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,720
rural and structurally weak

1118
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,480
areas and we are also

1119
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,039
happy to take a look at it, so if you have more ideas with it

1120
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,529
He doesn't have that either, so I can

1121
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:49,029
recommend stations  the perfect place

1122
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,039
in many respects and the railway company

1123
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:52,960
sells a lot of these buildings and

1124
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,299
doesn't want them anymore

1125
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:58,480
and that's definitely more worthwhile than

1126
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,220
the next rossmann or something like that, but

1127
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,420
felix isn't like that in the

1128
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,279
cities that there are also places that he

1129
00:41:06,279 --> 00:41:07,950
refers because I only say

1130
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,630
shopping centers

1131
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,549
yes, but unfortunately it has not yet

1132
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:16,150
been established that you can simply use these areas for

1133
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,619
other purposes.

1134
00:41:17,619 --> 00:41:19,170
You then somehow have this

1135
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:22,660
weird morality that is not

1136
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,609
visited and someone used it to write off their

1137
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:26,559
profits somewhere else, no

1138
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:29,549
idea  that would

1139
00:41:29,549 --> 00:41:32,980
have jumped out at me on the spur of the moment on the council

1140
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,670
there are a number of ones that I could turn

1141
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,140
into an excellent expert with enough money

1142
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,529
, yes I would have been

1143
00:41:41,529 --> 00:41:43,660
totally keen on it, but the

1144
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,039
problem is that these buildings are

1145
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:47,319
usually no longer owned by the

1146
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:49,470
are city that means

1147
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,940
you are back in the private sector with

1148
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,259
business and then it gets difficult

1149
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:57,039
so i think we can

1150
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:59,200
say that space is a huge topic for

1151
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,960
engagement it's great that you

1152
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,420
create these spaces bigger who always more beautiful

1153
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,700
what i find interesting what's

1154
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,769
the difference between you guys

1155
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:10,299
then somehow you go the distance to

1156
00:42:10,299 --> 00:42:12,970
come to you  for those who get

1157
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:14,859
involved but the young person or

1158
00:42:14,859 --> 00:42:18,130
adult with you felix correct

1159
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,380
me if i say wrong so maybe

1160
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,970
more of a bit longer-term

1161
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,259
commitment to somehow

1162
00:42:23,259 --> 00:42:26,470
agree

1163
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,390
to give a break for half a year i don’t know and that

1164
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,069
’s from both of you  listening and one

1165
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:32,230
wish would be that your fellow campaigners would

1166
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,390


1167
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,849
also find something like

1168
00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:38,920
bookkeeping, subsidy management, for example, so they would

1169
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,670
rather take on the well treacherous things

1170
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,980
than as committed people and

1171
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,839
that actually with a lot of other

1172
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:49,029
non-profit organizations

1173
00:42:49,029 --> 00:42:50,559
can be enthusiastic about listening to it but

1174
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:52,100
maybe is  yes here someone there

1175
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,480
There are also samples to be taken on. Do you

1176
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,580
have anything else

1177
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,190
you would like to share on the subject of digital engagement and

1178
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,960
perhaps with a view to the next

1179
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,000
legislation

1180
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,860


1181
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,970


1182
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,440


1183
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,420


1184
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,030
?  So whoever would like to spend

1185
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,010
a year or a year and a half here with

1186
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,930
us or even half a year in

1187
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,580
Fürstenberg and play with the

1188
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,960
adjustable yard a bit

1189
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,180


1190
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,330


1191
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:29,030
is open  over the next

1192
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,180
four years and as far as the legislature is concerned

1193
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,890
, i would say we all have to watch very

1194
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,380
closely to see whether it stays the same,

1195
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,260
that with many other digital

1196
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,720
topics, yes, that voluntary work

1197
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,460
should be strengthened, that you should be better

1198
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,670
financed in the foundation and

1199
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:49,190
then we have to  somehow measure the current traffic light against

1200
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:51,560
what is now

1201
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,270
full-bodied somehow here in the ra

1202
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,980
was changed and i just hope

1203
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,780
maybe we're all lucky and

1204
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,600
that's really meant seriously and

1205
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,870
we're not

1206
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:05,240
maybe further on the way downhill

1207
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,700
but there is a bit of light at the

1208
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,970
end of the tunnel and as far as many of these

1209
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:13,040
digital topics are concerned  we're

1210
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,540
getting out of the valley of darkness a bit

1211
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,930


1212
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:19,490
yes i don't think i have much

1213
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,590
to add to that let me put it this way i

1214
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,000
wish because we are now also

1215
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,800
serving our own legislative period at the

1216
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,900
time started so at the end of the

1217
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,810
legislative period i would like to be more

1218
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:31,250
friendly and benevolent about  I would be happy to

1219
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,650
be able to talk to the Berlin administration.

1220
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,380


1221
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,910
I would like to thank you both very, very much,

1222
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:39,260
above all, for your

1223
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,180
heart and soul for the commitment to

1224
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,580
everything you do on site and for us as a

1225
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,440
society and thank everyone who

1226
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,320
listened outside and when it came to the

1227
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,120
topic  engagement goes we are down there for you

1228
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,050
and thank you a candidate

1229
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:56,600
or also thank you  something very important

1230
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,250
that you do this and it is very

1231
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:59,770
important that this

1232
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:02,510
is pursued further because you are filling a

1233
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:06,330
gap that was just like we were before,

1234
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:09,660
thank you, I go, children,

1235
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:14,050
