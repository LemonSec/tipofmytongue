00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,360
hello good afternoon welcome to the

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,160
exciting stage dear creatures outside

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,560
out there on your devices

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,359
i'm really happy to open our stage

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,400
today

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,320
i'm a bit sad to do it um

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,000
all alone here

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,960
but no audience

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,359
so it's even better that at least for

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,880
our first talk uh we have a pretty full

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,520
uh panel um so

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,920
with all the seven people uh here on the

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,600
stage it would be rather crowded um but

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,600
yay internet it's possible to have them

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,559
all there and still be alone on here and

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,239
but there are so many people so i don't

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,480
want to uh talk too much about them so

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,280
they have time to talk themselves so um

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,280
welcome to the exam listen that's the

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,840
first talk and uh

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,199
your talk speakers

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,080
yeah thank you very much

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,640
um unfortunately we

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,280
just lost mario so talking about

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,720
internet

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,240
um

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,479
who is supposed to actually uh run the

29
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,920
session mostly

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,040
uh but i also get the notes here

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,840
um so let's uh let's maybe start with

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,680
what this session is going to be about

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,520
and let's hope that mario will also be

34
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,479
joining back in a bit

35
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,560
so i want to share the story of the ps

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,119
lab that's one of our projects and our

37
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,360
challenges in corona times

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,520
our goal is to inspire others to create

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,079
open hardware and to share their stories

40
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,159
of how they find solutions to problems

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,720
and specifically in these corona times

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,720
and in turn this might help us as well

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,479
and welcome back mario i just did the

44
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,159

also can see how we basically work so

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,119
whenever something's not working or

51
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,959
something needs to be fixed

52
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,599
and this is how we um collaborate um

53
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,800

54
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,520

usual regular meetings of the pocket

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,440

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,360
person so um i would like to nominate

61

hello i'm daniel

63
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,800
um i joined the pocket science lab i

64
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,640
know maybe one and a half or two years

65
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,599
ago but also saw it in singapore a few

66
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,319
times at frost asia and i was really

67
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,319
excited about it and

68
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,200
personally i mainly concentrate on how

69
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,840
people can use it and work with students

70
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,480
to to test it and it's some like

71
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,840
musical

72
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,400
instrument misuse of the pocket science

73
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,280
lab and i hand over to alexander

74
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,599

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,239
working

77
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,560
with the psb team now for

78
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,480
about a year and a half

79
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,680
and i mostly

80
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,879
work on the software side

81
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,680
so that means mostly the

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,799
the python component which is

83
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,200
a standalone library which can be used

84
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,959
[Music]

85
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,840
by people who are familiar with python

86
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,159
scripting and it is also the the driver

87
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,680
layer for the graphical user interface

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,720
and i also do some work on the firmware

89
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,000
um

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,080
yeah i originally originally got

91
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,599
interested in in the ps lab

92
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,599
during the summer

93
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,879
of 2020

94
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,400

first g-shock in 2017

105

and ever since i was

106
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,199
with the project mainly working on the

107
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,280
hardware and

108
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,759
collaborating a bit to android and the

109
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,720
firmware part as well

110
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:30,960
yeah

111
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,040
i think i can pass on to

112
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,440
kiwi

113
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,000
hi um my name is uh kiwi so um basically

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,160
uh friends of forest asia for quite a

115
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,360
while um so here in singapore so

116
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,280
basically not just a ps lab but uh any

117
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,440
kind of a highway production

118
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,440
uh needed from laser cutting uh

119
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,720
generally they'll just come to the

120
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,080
office

121
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
design troubleshoot

122
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,520
and redesign again

123
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,479
until we manage to get the

124
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,000
design and the casing correct so so hand

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,360
over to

126
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,280
wait up

127
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,880
hi so yeah i'm with that uh

128
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,280
i'm i'm i'm currently co-founder of a

129
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,000
fandigo i air uh

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,680
back crowdfunding

131
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,160
for for impact businesses yeah so my

132
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,320
role in pocket science lab is actually

133
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,240
the manufacturing and of course the

134
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,440
distributing

135
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,080
i've been dealing with

136
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,160
the manufacturing issues

137
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,120
which is

138
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,639
which is a headache especially during

139
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,080
the coroner times

140
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,120

147
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,759
uh as a project i guess

148
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,039

to integrate

155
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,639
scientific equipment on the pocket

156
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,000
science lab

157
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,520
to give this depth

158
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,400
and

159
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,919
make it useful

160
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,199
on a sensitive on the scientific field

161
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,840
and yeah

162
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,880

by day i'm actually a software engineer

174
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,560
working mostly on the web

175
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,520
and so i took over a bit the development

176
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,840
of the desktop application which is

177
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,880
based on electron and that's interfacing

178
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,199
with what alex talked about uh the

179
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,840
python interface that is our driver

180
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,960
and with that i hand over to

181
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,440
uh good question i think everybody spoke

182
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,800
and over back to mario

183
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,280
i'm yet um and

184
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,199
yeah maybe uh

185
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,360
thank you short introduction if you like

186
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,800
can you hear me actually yes

187
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,120
yes so the funny thing is i see myself

188
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,039
on the screen but i um

189
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,160
it apparently you don't see me for some

190
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,639
reason but yes so thank you everyone i'm

191
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,440
here

192
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,560
um

193
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,639
i studied first asia organization with

194
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,759
mario back in 2009

195
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,800
and

196
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,479
so um

197
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,400
what we want to do with the organization

198
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,160
we we try to

199
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,759
improve uh people's lives um in asia and

200
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,599
everywhere through sharing open

201
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,000
technologies and foster global

202
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,759
connections

203
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,680
um besides asia i also serve as um

204
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,319
the vice of the open source committee at

205
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,240
the ieee

206
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,560
and uh board member of the open source

207
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,720
business alliance and the open source

208
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,639
initiative

209
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,400
in the recent year i started to um focus

210
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,080
on um

211
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,800
localization i believe this is um the

212
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,319
way to have uh to produce locally and um

213
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,400
solve like some of the problem problems

214
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,560
and i'm really happy to be here today so

215
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,479
as a pocket scientist coming out of the

216
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,400
conversation organization i've been

217
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,360
involved um in the project um from the

218
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,679
start engaging with the community and

219
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,440
tried to bring the pakistan left to

220
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,000
education

221
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,519
okay thank you very much home fook so um

222
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,440
yeah i already got a lot of flowers here

223
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,560
in the uh

224
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,360
um in the introductions as you can see

225
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,279
guys i'm one of the person here trying

226
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,120
to bring everyone together

227
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,040
and i'm always really excited when we

228
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,480
achieved to bring um people from um

229
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,120
like around the world together so um

230
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,320
actually people didn't say where they

231
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,240
are from because i think in our meetings

232
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,519
is always so normal that we just have

233
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,839
these global calls but i want to tell

234
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,000
them you guys here so we have um

235
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,120
participants from sri lanka like padma

236
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,160
ah we ted and kiwi and you guys are in

237
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,440
singapore

238
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,800
daniel um

239
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,120
both daniels are in in germany

240
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,800
alessandro is right now in italy

241
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,160
alexander is in

242
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,920
sweden and tom focus um from vietnam and

243
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,800
so it's really exciting and

244
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,720
this is also one goal of our session

245
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,680
here we want to share how we work with

246
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,800
open hardware how open hardware can be a

247
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,519
way to collaborate um around the globe

248
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,880
without having to sign any any ndas and

249
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,560
how we solve um global uh problems and

250
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,600
what are our ideas and how how we as

251
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,839
open hardware contributors and how

252
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,959
others can um help to solve the climate

253
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,839
change so before we go and really like

254
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,640
to tackle that question i think it is

255
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,560
important to share a bit about our

256
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,040
background and how we came to the point

257
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,360
where we are now in the uh pocket

258
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,560
science lab so um i would like to start

259
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,440
this conversation here today um by

260
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,600
talking a little bit about the history

261
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,640
and um yeah i think we can uh here like

262
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,760
uh

263
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,120
maybe start with padma padma um

264
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,720
you have been one of the oldest

265
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,279
contributors on this project could you

266
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,760
share a little bit about your story how

267
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,000
you started to collaborate here in

268
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,240
pocket science lab i mean like we know

269
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,839
that for example collaboration on

270
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,079
software is happening for a long time

271
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,800
already but hardware it's

272
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
somehow more challenging so how did you

273
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,120
get started and how was it actually that

274
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,480
we achieved to collaborate on hardware

275
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,880
manufacturing

276
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,839
yeah maybe i can tell how i started with

277
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,240
this ps lab project in the first place

278
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,079
i in 2017 when i was an undergraduate i

279
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,839
i was looking into this google summer of

280
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,200
code program

281
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,120
and i was going through organizations

282
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,279
and found the forces as one of the

283
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,760
credible organizations to join and work

284
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,800
with

285
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,240
at first uh this gsoc is a is more like

286
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,399
a software-based

287
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,440
program

288
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,000
where it does not it does not facilitate

289
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,800
much of hardware things so

290
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,200
as a result there was this expires

291
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,560
project

292
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,720
which was

293
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,800
in the community for a while but it it

294
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,720
was kind of a

295
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,079
slow going

296
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,480
so we

297
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,680
so in

298
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,000
the force asia took it over and then

299
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,800
we tried to bring it to a level that we

300
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,440
can uh mass produce it and make it more

301
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,279
user friendly with a lot of applications

302
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,200
that people can interface this hardware

303
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,839
with and as a result i got into this

304
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,160
pslab android project which is software

305
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,839
so so it

306
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,000
falls in line with this giza project so

307
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,120
i

308
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,639
uh joined this google summer of code

309
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,959
project for about three months

310
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,240
and once the one this period is over and

311
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,320
mario and hong kong we were discussing

312
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,560
how to proceed further

313
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,880
outside this user program because

314
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,839
it was a software

315
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,560
software

316
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,320
software program

317
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,160
so

318
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,200
then

319
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,040
i was doing my internship at singapore

320
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,079
so

321
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,240
mario and me that

322
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,000
i think there are a couple of lot of a

323
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,760
lot of people from this coal were in

324
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,600
singapore at that time

325
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,680
so we got together and we we had we had

326
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,800
this uh maker space in singapore we we

327
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,120
joined them we discussed how to progress

328
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,680
and we designed the first prototype

329
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,360
and from that

330
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,399
we

331
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,800
after doing many peer reviews we we

332
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,959
developed the version that that is

333
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,959
currently on the market

334
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,880
and that's how we started and

335
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,760
where we're heading around

336
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,040
yeah thank you very much um i think we

337
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,880
don't have too much time to actually go

338
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,440
into all the features and uh what the

339
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,920
pocket science lab can do uh definitely

340
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,920
check out this uh website psl dot io and

341
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,079
um yeah you can definitely also produce

342
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,639
it yourself or um check a few stores on

343
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,560
the internet um if you want to order

344
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,040
this so this is completely open hardware

345
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,560
you can um

346
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,399
make all kinds of experiments with it

347
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,399
you can even control simple robots with

348
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,279
it up to four servos are supported and

349
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,839
and any sensor that has i squared c

350
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,880
standard can be supported if there's any

351
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,440
glitch and just open an issue in our

352
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,920
repositories and they're all linked on

353
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,079
the website but like we want to talk

354
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,560
this time more about um the story how we

355
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,880
produce the open hardware and padma you

356
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,199
already shared how we made the uh how

357
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,240
you make the prototypes so basically you

358
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,160
work on the code you use like open

359
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,959
source programs like key cat right and

360
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,639
then you um

361
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,480
how did you get the prototypes actually

362
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,959
produced

363
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,880
well i i would say for uh

364
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
for a general purpose prototype one

365
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
would try to

366
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
ask some of the manufacturers usually in

367
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,680
china to do the prototyping

368
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,360
uh usually assembly

369
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,600
assembly part as well but

370
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,079
here we thought it would be more more

371
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,079
efficient if we do it ourselves it would

372
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,199
save us some time and effort

373
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,680
so i remember we we were doing

374
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,839
like uh

375
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,839
three or four prototypes before we get

376
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,920
to what we have right now

377
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,880
and all these were done by uh manual

378
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,000
soldering

379
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,240
usually is empty

380
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,150
um

381
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,189
[Music]

382
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,120
wow quite quite a lot of work but

383
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,199
we are also very lucky that we had padma

384
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,120
because the components are so small i

385
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,199
think not many people were able to

386
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,600
solder them but we were sitting down in

387
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,880
the hackerspace in singapore and uh yeah

388
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,880
together and like i

389
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,199
yeah supported partner

390
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,199
with my thoughts with my mind because

391
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,720
they were so small i couldn't have done

392
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,880
it and but then was the question we were

393
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,120
pretty happy with the outcome and the

394
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,680
big question was how can we produce them

395
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,839
and um i think we could never have done

396
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,480
it without wheathead wheathead would you

397
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,120
like to share a bit about the story how

398
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,199
um it came to the production and what

399
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,279
were the challenges

400
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,519
all right okay the production wasn't

401
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,920
easy definitely right we had a lot of

402
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,759
challenges things like

403
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,560
uh

404
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,399
language we have things like the uh uh

405
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,160
quality assurance things all these

406
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,440
things coming

407
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,320
that's that's totally new to us right so

408
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,519
especially as a as we we this is our

409
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,480
first time producing so naturally how do

410
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,320
we first thing we think was how do we

411
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,079
actually reach out to

412
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,399
the people in china the the manufacturer

413
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,480
in china right so we actually look

414
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
through a few

415
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,880
websites and of course alibaba was one

416
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,519
of the the first few that came out right

417
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,160
so alibaba was actually brought us a few

418
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,639
quotes of different components and stuff

419
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,120
initially we were thinking about

420
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,639
procuring the parts ourselves and

421
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,800
finding manufacturing ourselves but

422
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,360
luckily we actually found a

423
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
very nice

424
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
distributor who actually connected us

425
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,079
with one of their long-term partners who

426
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,320
actually also does the manufacturing of

427
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
the circuit boards as well

428
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,199
so a lot of two and back uh

429
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,279
and and just nice it hit the chinese new

430
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,880
year period and oh

431
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,480
during this entire period of time

432
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,560
especially in china they had actually

433
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,360
one month long of the holidays so we

434
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,800
actually had to rush

435
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,279
rush uh the the production rush the

436
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,440
revision rush the schematics

437
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,600
and we rushed a lot of things just to

438
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,399
just to make it happen yeah

439
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,799
and of course uh this involves going

440
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,439
going down to the factory itself to make

441
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,039
sure that the things

442
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,039
are properly in place the quality

443
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,839
assurance the quality checks and and of

444
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,839
course and all this stuff as well yeah

445
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,679
uh one of the problems that we actually

446
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,400
faced while we were trying to uh source

447
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,359
the components ourselves was uh we met

448
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,599
some of the uh some of the

449
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,760
distributors actually selling those

450
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,919
secondhand components which actually

451
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,000
will overall bring down the quality of

452
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,559
the uh pcb

453
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,320
bring they bring down in terms of what

454
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,240
we are saying things like

455
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,679
there's a higher rate of failure or we

456
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,880
there will be higher rate of

457
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,039
manufacturing

458
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,120
being disposed as well yeah

459
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,200
so how is this process actually changed

460
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,360
now during the coronal crisis

461
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,520
more or less things are still the same

462
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,200
luckily for our distributor they are

463
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,280
still there they are they are not closed

464
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,960
down yet yeah

465
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,160
so that's the fortunate part uh

466
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,679
things definitely has become more

467
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,200
expensive

468
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,720
when we talk about

469
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,640
supply chain things are getting stuck at

470
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,120
different ports

471
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,520
you know factory shutting down people

472
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,600
getting quarantined

473
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,760
factories workers and things like that

474
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,400
so because of all these issues the cost

475
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,120
the turnaround time actually went up

476
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,480
when we talked about turnaround time we

477
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
are talking about components that we

478
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,160
might actually wait for

479
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,280
say

480
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,720
what could have been

481
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,000
out there

482
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,600
three we could have gotten the

483
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,360
components in three months

484
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,520
they're required maybe to the end of

485
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,960
next year

486
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,799
uh maybe not even end of the exam we're

487
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,960
talking about three years later

488
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,679
the the next available components are

489
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,320
available as well so this

490
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,880
this this

491
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,200
this results in some of the distributors

492
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,120
not just china probably around the world

493
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,039
as well to start holding on those

494
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,760
components that are very uh

495
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,120
say crucial

496
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,640
they are more commonly used which

497
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,960
resulted in the prices going up sky

498
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,200
holding we talked about

499
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,120
one of the chips the mcp chips that we

500
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,240
are using

501
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,400
it could be actually just be a few uh

502
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,160
one dollar it's actually about six

503
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,240
dollars now so that's actually quite a

504
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,440
huge jump

505
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,360
yeah

506
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,120
so but uh

507
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,480
the the rest of the challenges still

508
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,799
stay the same finding a partner who you

509
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,320
really can work with

510
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,720
and and and all these things are pretty

511
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,320
much some of the things that we see we

512
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,520
need to set across while when we are

513
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,960
doing the production yeah

514
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,840
and while we have that idea and about

515
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,600
local production i think here we will

516
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,919
talk soon about it a little bit more in

517
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,880
detail and we are not there yet i mean

518
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,120
our batches are relatively small i mean

519
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,799
the industry produces hundreds of

520
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,960
thousands of batches we are producing a

521
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,120
thousand or yeah in these kind of

522
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,000
numbers

523
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,159
and so um

524
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,320
we're still doing the production now in

525
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,200
in china and so what are the challenges

526
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,280
when talking with the chinese people i

527
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,120
know i know at the beginning we tried to

528
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,559
talk to them in english and then we we

529
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,480
switched to chinese can you

530
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,679
tell a bit more about that uh yeah okay

531
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,480
so

532
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,360
so uh true ali on alibaba platform right

533
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,440
we actually we are only allowed to

534
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,240
converse in english purely english so

535
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,640
any mandarin was actually reflected so

536
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
this verse alibaba was meant to be built

537
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,280
for for international buyers right so

538
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,159
they don't want the the native speakers

539
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,120
from china to to start going uh to

540
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,960
around in alibaba you know and checking

541
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,880
out prizes and things like that so

542
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,400
everything was in english

543
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,280
so naturally after that and they took it

544
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,880
offline

545
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,600
we

546
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
everything was true gmail was true we

547
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,039
chat

548
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,400
it was still in english as well right so

549
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,760
up to a certain point where we feel that

550
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,000
information was lost

551
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,039
during the communication so that's

552
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:09,840
where

553
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,720
where we started start to converse in

554
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,799
mandarin you know luckily in singapore

555
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,360
we actually most of us actually are able

556
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,120
to communicate

557
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,679
bilingual so it's english it's an and

558
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,760
another language so so for me it's of

559
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,880
course mandarin right so i communicated

560
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,799
with them with mandarin of course they

561
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,400
get it back they get it they get the

562
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,520
idea across

563
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,400
and then of course

564
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,919
when you are able to converse in

565
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,480
mandarin their service towards

566
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,240
their service towards us also it became

567
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,360
better because they understand that

568
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,559
we could also

569
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,640
communicate with other distributors or

570
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,600
manufacturers or

571
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,400
in china as well you know to compare the

572
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,600
quality so naturally the quality of

573
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,520
their service became better

574
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,760
yeah but after

575
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,799
and and and because of the the able to

576
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,640
converse in mandarin of course they were

577
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,600
able to to do to show us more stuff they

578
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,360
even did a free

579
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,520
checks on these schematics for us to

580
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
make sure that it doesn't

581
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,158
hit any production issues yeah

582
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,640
cool and yeah but as you said things

583
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,840
have changed a bit i mean

584
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,840
our um

585
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,640
advantage is that we have um the

586
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,120
established connection already and we

587
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,960
understand the process much better i

588
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,400
mean like actually it's pretty

589
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,880
straightforward the process but when you

590
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,240
do it the first time when you produce

591
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,679
the first time you're not sure right is

592
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,440
it like this or is it like this where we

593
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,200
get cheated and

594
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,760
and we also um yeah for us it was quite

595
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,640
a substantial investment um like we

596
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,000
started a

597
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,520
commercial operation because as a

598
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,080
community you cannot just produce in a

599
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,360
pocket science lab and but we achieved

600
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,960
to do it and we had some insights from

601
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,360
you wechat but now we have corona time

602
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,559
so how

603
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,240
could we do it in current times when

604
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,640
there are component shortages

605
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,799
um how did we work it out and yeah padma

606
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,880
you were the center of the hardware

607
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,159
prototyping of the new version and which

608
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,360
comes with a few cool features so we are

609
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,679
supporting more and more robot

610
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,880
functions and we have added an sd card

611
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,600
we added a small battery and more wi-fi

612
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,720
bluetooth

613
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,200
features um pins for more experiments so

614
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,840
it's it's like a kind of a new product

615
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,400
even and so um

616
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,960
yeah a lot of new components were added

617
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,600
a battery and so on and uh we needed to

618
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,880
make new prototypes so padma how did

619
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,080
this work out how how were you able to

620
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,399
um yeah get the prototypes together

621
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,600
yeah

622
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,640
[Music]

623
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,840
okay so padma dropped out of there

624
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,039
thing with connection to sri lanka

625
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:07,919
ah

626
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,320
you are back um can you here so how did

627
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,400
it work out how were you able to produce

628
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,640
the new prototypes now in coronal times

629
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,799
but maybe shaky connection

630
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,279
but i think we were also there the uh uh

631
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,000
the other people right i mean um

632
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,720
so maybe uh daniel because you also were

633
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,720
part of that discussion daniel maslowski

634
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,799
uh a little bit how how did that work

635
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,880
out with the prototypes do you remember

636
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,400
how we tried to to figure this out

637
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,159
i think i'm back

638
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,640
okay so then go ahead

639
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,840
here

640
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,840
so

641
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,760
i remember when we were doing prototypes

642
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,600
we we usually

643
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,039
uh make

644
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,840
a thoughtful devices c304 and then we

645
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,320
distribute among ourselves

646
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,159
and then we test this

647
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,960
and while we are using it we feel like

648
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,600
okay now one might find this switch

649
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,919
useful and we we try to

650
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,520
put that fish in this

651
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,960
in this new board

652
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,120
and so we we get a new prototype

653
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,480
so we uh

654
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,279
we went a couple of times and we had two

655
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,400
or three

656
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,240
three of these improvements

657
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,799
so that's that's how we got this uh sd

658
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,360
card this real time clock

659
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,720
and the

660
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,880
battery management system and

661
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,559
new ics for

662
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,760
existing ones and then comes the corona

663
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,720
and

664
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,640
along with it came this

665
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,440
cheap shortage worldwide

666
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,200
so

667
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,799
but

668
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,799
for most of the chips they they were

669
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,919
having a very long lead time some

670
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,320
some parts might not not be even

671
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,360
available for about a couple more years

672
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,440
so but we couldn't wait until

673
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
these parts become available

674
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,880
so as a

675
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,600
solution what we try to do is we

676
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,880
we salvage some components from old pcbs

677
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,840
and we

678
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,080
soldered them and tried to

679
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,600
just

680
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,320
have this proof of concept ready so that

681
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,640
then when when the components are ready

682
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,640
we can just go directly to mass

683
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,080
production

684
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,600
and that's how we tackle that problem

685
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,320
yes and our big question was

686
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,240
how could we do that in the future also

687
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,760
what we have maybe components that

688
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,120
aren't available

689
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,760
and what if supply chains are

690
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,760
like more disrupted

691
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,520
um so um and yeah and there we had the

692
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,799
great

693
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,440
connection here to daniel vasilek um who

694
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,000
worked also and supported us in the open

695
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,880
next project um which was funded um

696
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,880
by you horizon 2020 um and daniel um we

697
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,880
took an idea that kiwi had told us like

698
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,279
years ago already with the local

699
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,480
production um so um

700
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,159
how um do you think like that idea could

701
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,640
apply for example for us in future even

702
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,440
more

703
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,600
um could you um explain a bit about

704
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,159
decentralized local production and how

705
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,480
it could benefit us and and what is the

706
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,320
idea for example with the corporation

707
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,960
that we try to start with the

708
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,559
university of applied science here in

709
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,039
berlin

710
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,760
sure it was just just another thought

711
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,200
but i don't know if this is technically

712
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,080
possible like to have like parametric

713
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,480
keycap files basically so that you have

714
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,360
a list of components for

715
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,360
each part basically and then re-roots

716
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,880
the things or something but this was

717
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,120
just something uh along the lines where

718
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,840
i was wondering how to how to possibly

719
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,760
solve this but like it's very great that

720
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,320
we have this connection to the brt

721
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,520
berlin

722
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,440
school of technique

723
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,840
and they have a long tradition in making

724
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,159
pcbs so they have all the chemicals and

725
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,120
a lot of like tools to make pcbs but

726
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,559
also like pick and place machines

727
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,120
so we were already in the process of

728
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,760
starting to getting this running and

729
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,559
it's of course like machines that

730
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,679
have been sponsored by industry for

731
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,279
example so they were running in

732
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,120
production for a while but

733
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,039
no one has ever used them in the new

734
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,360
location so so

735
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,159
then

736
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,919
there came the

737
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,399
chip shortage and and everything got

738
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,720
delayed a bit but in general i think

739
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,039
especially for bigger things and open

740
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,880
hardware can be like electronics but it

741
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,399
can also be

742
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,159
furniture and all different kinds of

743
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,720
objects their local production makes

744
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,440
even more of a difference because if you

745
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,600
just share the plans and the ways and

746
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,279
the processes and the production

747
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,799
possibilities

748
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,200
and then you source your products and

749
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,080
the

750
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,320
machines locally and you can like just

751
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,559
get your i don't know your shelf system

752
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,840
that's exactly fitted to your space

753
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,000
from your city and and everything

754
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,640
happens there of course you have a lot

755
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,600
of less transportation

756
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,159
and so i think it's a strong case

757
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,240
especially for bigger

758
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,000
open hardware

759
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,679
projects and

760
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,720
back to electronics i think we

761
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,200
got so used to just sending off the

762
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,240
files to china and shortly after getting

763
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,200
everything

764
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,880
chipped back and everything was working

765
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,279
perfectly and then there was like

766
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,320
this ship ever given and suddenly

767
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,480
nothing was moving anymore and then it

768
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,039
was corona and so on so i think there's

769
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,120
more of a realization that it would be

770
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,399
good to

771
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,039
have this to not lose the skills and the

772
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,960
and the possibilities even though it

773
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,440
might be more expensive to produce

774
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,960
there directly for example here in

775
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,440
germany but it would be

776
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,559
smart to get better at that and not to

777
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,760
replace the possibilities of producing

778
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,600
globally but to

779
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,919
add to the to the ways of doing it and

780
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,200
especially for

781
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,919
smaller badges i think it's super great

782
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,240
if you're able to go through all these

783
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,399
steps and it's also for the students

784
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,840
great to learn

785
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,960
so and um we have talked a lot about

786
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
what are our challenges in the

787
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,360
production um but the question is also

788
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,279
um how

789
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,000
a different way of producing can for

790
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,640
example help us to save energy help us

791
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,520
in the fight against a climate change

792
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,240
and we have kiwi here who is based in

793
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,840
singapore and works with the um yeah

794
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,520
laser cutter project with the laser

795
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,840
cutter project in his company lions

796
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,279
forge um

797
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,880
and yeah kiwi helped us to produce these

798
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,600
casings in the pocket science lab and

799
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,840
for example here with laser cuts and

800
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,200
with

801
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,440
files that we posted then um on our

802
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,399
repositories so kiwi could you tell us a

803
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,720
bit about the advantages of local

804
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,679
production and what advantages and does

805
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,679
open hardware have here

806
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,159
yeah uh thank you mario uh for giving it

807
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,960
this time to uh share on this uh subject

808
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,080
um so uh this local production um but i

809
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,840
will change the terminology not just for

810
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,159
myself uh i will call it community

811
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,840
production

812
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,720
so

813
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,679
um

814
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,080
so i've been talking about community

815
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,399
production since uh we first met with

816
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,240
mario office asia

817
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,559
so i'm a strong believer that

818
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,640
not just about

819
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,919
resilience

820
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,360
for the community

821
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,399
but also looking at sustainability

822
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,399
the reason uh just give you one quick

823
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,120
example so a lot of the ps lab casing

824
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,000
that uh we made as a prototype we're

825
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,320
actually using whatever material we can

826
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,880
find uh in office so just come in and

827
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,440
say guys we want to make a prototype uh

828
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,960
i have some material here or there we

829
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,880
just take it we just recycle

830
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,880
and then here we are managed to come up

831
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,600
with

832
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,039
functional prototypes

833
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,360
and this will also be applied uh to a

834
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,960
lot of other projects especially during

835
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,440
kofi 19. so if i may i'll just share

836
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,799
with you some

837
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,440
presentation

838
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,519
it just happened that i have given

839
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,440
another

840
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,360
session but again from this picture if

841
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,799
you can see

842
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,240
uh so again local production especially

843
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,080
um or community production during the

844
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,840
time of crisis when everything come to a

845
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,159
standstill um but critical uh critical

846
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,559
supplies such as medical device

847
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,919
cannot be

848
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,440
accessed in other ways other than

849
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,840
fabricating yourself so just imagine

850
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,799
if the school is to open up and allows

851
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,120
the community to come in and fabricate

852
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,679
like convert the schools resources into

853
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,519
like a factory to produce like

854
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,760
ventilator face masks

855
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,880
you name it

856
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,720
uh just to draw something that i have

857
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,840
done

858
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,960
so uh

859
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,919
let me just

860
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,000
put this all right

861
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,559
okay so uh when the um

862
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,039
what happened here that when the kovi 19

863
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,880
uh hit us back in 2020 much uh singapore

864
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,960
was uh go straight into a lockdown um so

865
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,840
the

866
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,200
and we all know that from china's side

867
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,080
uh the shipment of mass facilities was

868
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,320
totally not available um so what

869
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,120
happened then is that we quickly

870
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,440
uh get uh which

871
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,760
the community to kind of fight

872
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,880
uh

873
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,399
whoever have 3d pictures where 3d

874
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,919
printer will use their 3d printer those

875
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,399
laser cutters like myself i'll just

876
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,200
build what we call a face shoe

877
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
production jig

878
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,120
right so using laser cutter we produce

879
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,159
this jig we distribute about 100 of

880
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,880
these jigs to 100 volunteers

881
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,240
each of them within a day can produce

882
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,559
100 pieces of face shoes so as a result

883
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,799
uh we are able to kind of gather the

884
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,120
community uh come together distribute

885
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,080
the face shoes which you can see

886
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,240
uh down here to the uh what i call the

887
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,800
front lines workers or people who are

888
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,719
in what i call it

889
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,239
as a disadvantage so these are the

890
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,199
high-risk

891
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,399
areas so whether whether they are

892
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,679
selling food or whether they are

893
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,839
working in

894
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,800
hospital so these are some of the

895
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,200
example

896
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,320
all right okay so going back so the um

897
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,320
so these are just a very minor small

898
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,239
examples but you can see that

899
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,760
if this

900
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,879
process of having the community able to

901
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,560
produce your own goods using the

902
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,000
resources you have within the facilities

903
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,760
so it's not just about

904
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,239
not being threatened by china it's also

905
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,679
the ability

906
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,399
now that uh kofi 19 or the pandemic is

907
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,480
going to be the new norm so you never

908
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
know when will be the next lockdown

909
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,359
right

910
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,040
so it's better for the community to be

911
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,599
more prepared and as we move towards

912
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,359
climate change so let's just talk about

913
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,720
a bit on

914
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,640
uh the energy efficiency and the

915
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,839
material efficiency uh perspective

916
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,240
uh so put aside coffee 19 so you talk

917
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,640
about energy efficiency so

918
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,240
using your own

919
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,200
material that you can find uh that it

920
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,160
would otherwise been thrown uh as a

921
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,200
landfill

922
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,440
or been burned away as as waste now you

923
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
can use it for better good i think for

924
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,640
that perspective you can reduce a lot of

925
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,599
waste

926
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,680
and moreover able to produce your own

927
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,320
goods versus order it from china shipped

928
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,320
all the way to here the amount of carbon

929
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,160
footprints are produced by whether it's

930
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,480
from the aircraft or from the shipping

931
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,960
industry and the truck logistics those

932
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,520
who take out a lot of energy so in a way

933
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,359
you are reducing waste and at the same

934
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,960
time you are reducing the amount of

935
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,040
carbon footprint per product

936
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,839
uh so from that perspective i think

937
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,400
uh open hardware uh

938
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,560
comes in when we move away on not just

939
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
the material but also the design of

940
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,839
electronics so if in the future

941
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,119
all electronics are more or less a

942
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,040
standard template uh then student

943
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,040
speaking again just unplug one

944
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,359
component's electronics and apply it

945
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,200
into another

946
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,640
electronic cell

947
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,880
so right now obviously for the purpose

948
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,800
of education like arduino so they are

949
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
already doing that but what i'm saying

950
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,359
is that can we move that open

951
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,720
architecture that inter-compatibly

952
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,400
beyond just education

953
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
can we move it into the industry right

954
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,240
can we convince the industry to do that

955
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,560
so what assuming your

956
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,400
when people start to buy ev car they

957
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,920
start to trash with an ev car can we

958
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,119
take the same parts and then apply to

959
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,160
your washing machine apply it to your

960
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,920
other products you want to design right

961
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,599
right hand back to you mario

962
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,560
i think i thought

963
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,800
wow now i'm just amazed and you're

964
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,880
drawing very big vision and i think

965
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,320
these are the times

966
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,359
where we need such big visions and to

967
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,680
change the way really the industry works

968
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,640
and

969
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,800
we want to be examples we want to give

970
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,079
examples how this can really work and i

971
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,480
would like to ask again daniel veselek

972
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,839
in regards to a resilient and

973
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,320
sustainable society now that kiwi

974
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,240
mentioned and you are also a scientist

975
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,240
like a researcher

976
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,040
and what advantages do you see here um

977
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,440
um as open hardware um

978
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,119
like going along the way that

979
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,480
was what kiwi mentioned um as he as he's

980
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,800
doing it in a practical way what

981
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,000
opportunities do you see

982
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,280
yeah like like i was very happy that uh

983
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,839
this computer magazine ct

984
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:42,640
uh

985
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,240
published something on open source

986
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,680
hardware i think it's blurry now because

987
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,040
of the filter but um basically i think i

988
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,079
think this diy approach is one side of

989
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,480
the picture so like using what you have

990
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,839
and so on but

991
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,440
and i think it's a big one but at the

992
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,680
same time i think also being able to

993
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,480
like open your devices and so on like

994
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,880
right to repair has gotten a big push in

995
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,400
germany now because we have a new

996
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,720
government now and they have it within

997
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,920
their agenda to to foster this this this

998
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,839
approach so so for me it would be

999
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,240
already really great if like every

1000
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,640
device that i have like laying around

1001
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,400
especially the bigger ones if i can like

1002
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,599
open it up

1003
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,400
repair it um like

1004
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,320
exchange with other people that might

1005
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,359
also

1006
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,920
uh know what constantly goes wrong and

1007
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,160
so on so like so i think there's a lot

1008
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,680
of

1009
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,520
it would be super great to have mostly

1010
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,320
on hardware simply in my surrounding

1011
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,240
because because it would

1012
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,280
make it

1013
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,280
all a lot easier and maybe one could

1014
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,280
also like it's also easier than to if

1015
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,320
someone has a broken device or a device

1016
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,320
that they don't want to use anymore to

1017
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,400
really use this directly in order to

1018
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,040
exchange parts and so on so so the more

1019
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,880
modular things are as you were just

1020
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,040
explaining uh the better and

1021
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,200
i wonder like like what one can do

1022
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,520
because i i feel like there is some more

1023
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,560
emotion now like like we had a peak 10

1024
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,359
years ago also so but i think now it

1025
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,760
becomes more and more of the topic to

1026
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,920
push open hardware also on a political

1027
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,800
level

1028
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,280
so so i want to see more products and i

1029
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,560
want to see them everywhere basically

1030
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,440
in the kitchen and in the living room

1031
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,720
and like so so and for me like like if

1032
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,079
they are comparable devices like like

1033
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,400
like i would opt for the for the open

1034
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,320
ones of course because

1035
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,960
it's a big advantage basically

1036
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,839
um you talked about

1037
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,599
extensibility and we have alessandro

1038
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:44,560
here

1039
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,320
and so in the

1040
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,920
pocket science club project we can

1041
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,520
support um potentially any sensor that

1042
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,560
supports

1043
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,280
i squared c and this standard supported

1044
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,760
by a lot of sensors and we have circuit

1045
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,320
python implemented um we are working

1046
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,160
with sig rock so and and we have

1047
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,680
alessandro here alessandra you're

1048
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,079
working on a kind of extension or a

1049
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,839
component that can work together with a

1050
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,000
pocket science lab it is the open

1051
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
spectrometer and i think this is a very

1052
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,800
good example not just of how hardware

1053
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,880
extensibility

1054
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,200
can work but also how we collaborate

1055
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,440
collaborate in the project please tell

1056
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,119
us a bit more about the open

1057
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,400
spectrometer

1058
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,480
and what you can do with it in the

1059
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,880
future

1060
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,880
yes

1061
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,839
so

1062
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,680
for the first about the first question

1063
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,280
what i envisioned is this open source

1064
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,400
hardware

1065
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,280
reaching out also

1066
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,800
the laboratory the scientific

1067
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,280
laboratories and because there is such a

1068
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,200
need of standardization

1069
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,440
um the open source movement is would uh

1070
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
could really support scientific

1071
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,800
activities and

1072
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,599
in

1073
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,839
in the sense of uh reproducibility of

1074
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,240
experiments and equipment

1075
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,440
and uh

1076
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,839
like kiwi was saying it would be great

1077
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:09,040
to have a community uh capacity of

1078
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,800
building such equipment

1079
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,680
because you could empower communities

1080
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,720
that

1081
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,280
are hard to reach where they

1082
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,599
where the where the parts are not easy

1083
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,680
to be found

1084
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,520
and yes by standardizing the

1085
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,440
construction of this uh

1086
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,760
equipment this piece of equipment

1087
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,680
we could empower more people to do

1088
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,920
science and to make analysis and to

1089
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,400
style and to be able to study the the

1090
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,200
world and the problems around themselves

1091
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,480
about the spectrometer the

1092
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,920
spectrophotometer this is a tool that uh

1093
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,280
tells you

1094
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,079
what's in your sample so which chemical

1095
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,640
compound is in your sample and how much

1096
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,560
of it there is

1097
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,520
this is a very common technique used in

1098
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,839
biology biology laboratories and

1099
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,960
it can

1100
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,400
let you do very

1101
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,079
so a lot of uh

1102
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,400
uh different assays

1103
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,960
so tests

1104
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,960
and uh

1105
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,960
yes uh

1106
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,800
we are seeing we're having some troubles

1107
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,040
because when you attach so we have a

1108
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,119
really powerful sensor and

1109
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,440
there are some we are seeing that it's

1110
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,680
not so easy to

1111
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,920
to connect it uh with the pocket science

1112
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,079
lab but we are positive because through

1113
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,400
this experience we are really

1114
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,359
seeing

1115
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,520
what's the potential and how to go

1116
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,319
beyond the uh the actual capacity of

1117
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,839
pocket science labs so i'm really

1118
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,800
positive about this experience

1119
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,359
and uh i'm really looking forward to see

1120
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,920
when this will uh this tool with this

1121
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,319
device will actually work

1122
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,680
and

1123
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,240
starting with some workshops to teach

1124
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,079
about uh

1125
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,319
more complex scientific experiments to

1126
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,119
to people so already to young people so

1127
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,960
that they can proceed faster in the life

1128
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,640
science careers

1129
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,480
and yes i think that's a

1130
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,040
that's a quick summary of the world i

1131
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,520
always find it very exciting when i come

1132
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,520
to your top lab and we talk about this

1133
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,520
and we try out the first prototypes of

1134
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,160
the open spectrometer and you tell me

1135
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,720
what you can do with a spectrometer

1136
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,960
because for example you can go into the

1137
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,960
supermarket and

1138
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,400
check out fruits and so on could you

1139
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,079
give us a little bit more a few more

1140
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,760
examples

1141
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,359
okay yes

1142
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,319
so the practical applications uh that we

1143
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,560
envisioned is to check

1144
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,720
so it works by checking the color

1145
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,760
analyzing the rainbows of the

1146
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,000
chemicals so you you

1147
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,560
throw some light at the other substance

1148
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,880
and it reflects a color which is what we

1149
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,160
see

1150
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,839
and

1151
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,400
yes i'm family and

1152
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,160
everything

1153
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,920
and it reflects the color and if you

1154
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,119
split this color into a rainbow

1155
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,160
you can

1156
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,200
check how much of each

1157
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,240
tone of color there is and each chemical

1158
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,880
has a as a known pattern

1159
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,040
and through these you can tell

1160
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,920
how much nutrients micronutrients are in

1161
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,040
your

1162
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,800
fruit in the fruit or vegetable that

1163
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,680
you're buying how ripe they are and then

1164
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,760
you can make a study to check how

1165
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,960
nutritious is a

1166
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,680
food

1167
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,720
so a vegetable or fruit according to his

1168
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,040
writing status and then

1169
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,400
you can check

1170
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,200
uh

1171
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,280
what's nutritious to you

1172
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,160
or

1173
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,160
if you have some really fine

1174
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,880
spectroscopic method you can also tell

1175
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,839
if the water is contaminated and

1176
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,760
what's in the water so which which

1177
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,960
contaminant is it and track it back

1178
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,560
through knowledge

1179
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,839
to the source so if there is a

1180
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,920
contaminant in the river you can check

1181
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,400
if it's metal which metal or chemical

1182
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,240
dye and you can track it back to the

1183
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,240
source so to the industry which is

1184
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,240
releasing that into the

1185
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,920
waters

1186
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,079
these are kind of applications

1187
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,800
this tool so a simple version of this is

1188
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,760
used in the lab 25 for example results

1189
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,000
of pcrs tests which is the one that we

1190
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,960
use

1191
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,839
uh

1192
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:20,800
to check

1193
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,079
the golden standard to check the

1194
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,640
coronavirus for example they covered the

1195
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,839
19

1196
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,000
so they are called the

1197
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,040
qpcrs so real time and there is a

1198
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,839
different type of

1199
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,000
of uh

1200
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,960
of machine and there are it has these

1201
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,760
kind of spectrometers integrated so it

1202
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,760
works with light so there is a lot of

1203
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,400
there are a lot of applications and uh

1204
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,400
yeah maybe

1205
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,880
hopefully we will see something soon

1206
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,880
in the next in the coming year

1207
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,119
yeah i could imagine like all these kids

1208
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,920
they're doing uh um you can forge yeah

1209
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,079
and these kind of things where they go

1210
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,240
out in the supermarket test what is

1211
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,000
really true is it really true what's

1212
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
written on the product description is it

1213
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,400
really olive oil and are these products

1214
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,319
are really from that country and so on

1215
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,560
like right trying to find out all kinds

1216
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,920
of things with the open spectrometer so

1217
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,240
that would be so cool because um of

1218
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,800
course also want to lower the price not

1219
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,800
these expensive spectrometers that are

1220
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,079
available but good quality spectrometers

1221
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,880
for below 200 euros on future even below

1222
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,440
uh 100 euros that would be really

1223
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,680
amazing thank you very much

1224
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,000
for giving a few insights here and you

1225
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,839
should definitely give a talk on the

1226
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,839
entire thing because it's such a big

1227
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,200
topic

1228
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,079
thank you okay and and and we are we

1229
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,319
don't have like many hours but we had a

1230
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,400
few more minutes i think and

1231
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,119
um i would also like to talk a bit about

1232
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,240
like um how we overcame this corona

1233
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,280
crisis by focusing on different topics

1234
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,000
making them the ps lab more extensible

1235
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,640
by focusing on um software components

1236
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,359
and we have alex bessmann here from

1237
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:06,560
sweden

1238
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,520
who

1239
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,160
also joined the project like i think a

1240
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,800
couple of years ago and alex could you

1241
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,520
talk to us a little bit more about what

1242
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,400
has been the progress um for example in

1243
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,000
the area of circuit python of uh working

1244
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,760
on plugging in our

1245
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,000
libraries into sick rock and maybe not

1246
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,319
everyone knows what is sick rock but

1247
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,839
yeah would be great if you could share a

1248
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,680
little bit about the work that has been

1249
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,319
done here during the crisis and over how

1250
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:38,240
we overcame these challenging times

1251
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,559
absolutely

1252
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,119
so we have talked already a bit about uh

1253
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,440
the extensibility potential of the ps

1254
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,800
lab

1255
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,599
so any sensor that that

1256
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,280
talks over any of the protocols is spi

1257
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,480
or uart

1258
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,200
can theoretically be made to work with

1259
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,559
the pslab

1260
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,280
uh but each of those

1261
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,400
every search sensor every such device

1262
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,400
would need to have its own driver

1263
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,920
written

1264
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,359
basically

1265
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,440
but there's already a lot of drivers

1266
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,720
written out there

1267
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,880
with suitable licenses

1268
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,319
for a lot of sensors and a lot of

1269
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,000
devices

1270
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,359
and it turns out that a lot of these

1271
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,119
drivers are implemented in circuit

1272
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,800
python

1273
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,079
so we

1274
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,359
wanted to

1275
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:26,960
see if there was a way that we could

1276
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,200
reuse these drivers instead of making

1277
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,720
our own

1278
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,119
so we had a g-stock project on that

1279
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,520
this past summer and

1280
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,319
it was quite successful and

1281
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:41,440
after after that gsoc project

1282
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,200
was merged

1283
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,880
the ps lab

1284
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,599
can now use any sensor that has an

1285
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,200
existing driver

1286
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,440
uh written in circuit python

1287
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,160
with

1288
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,040
minimal work it takes a few lines of

1289
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:55,839
code

1290
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,319
to glue it all together but

1291
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,839
there's no need to to re-implement the

1292
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:03,119
entire driver anymore so that's a big

1293
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,720
success i think

1294
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,079
and the other

1295
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,839
project that that you mentioned mario is

1296
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,079
siggrop so sigric is a

1297
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,240
existing mature

1298
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,800
application and library for

1299
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,400
interfacing with

1300
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,200
a number of sensors and and instruments

1301
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,000
like oscilloscopes and

1302
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
logic analyzers and other devices

1303
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,520
and

1304
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,880
so we wanted to to see if we could

1305
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,680
use

1306
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,920
sigroq

1307
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,160
and integrate it with with the ps lab

1308
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:39,760
and the reason we wanted to do that was

1309
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,880
because

1310
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,720
two reasons mainly

1311
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,359
syncro provides support for it supports

1312
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:46,559
both

1313
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,319
pc of course uh but also android

1314
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,079
as does the ps lab

1315
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,240
but the ps labs android and desktop

1316
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,319
support are currently implemented in two

1317
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,960
completely parallel driver stacks one is

1318
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,240
written in java for android and the

1319
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,760
other is written in python for pc

1320
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,119
so any any

1321
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,640
work on the driver has to be done twice

1322
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,559
so if we could instead replace the

1323
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,480
drivers with with the

1324
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,119
sig rock then we could do it in only one

1325
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,200
place which would be uh

1326
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,720
beneficial for us

1327
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,480
uh in addition to that the sig rock

1328
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,839
project also supports a number of

1329
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,079
features that we would like to have but

1330
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,480
don't have yet so if we

1331
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,400
were successful in integrating siggrop

1332
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,079
then we would get those basically for

1333
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:30,880
free

1334
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,040
that work is not done yet but it's it's

1335
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,119
ongoing we currently have some

1336
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,000
uh

1337
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,839
communication issues with upstream but i

1338
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,400
think that's out of scope

1339
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,559
for for the talk

1340
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,559
um

1341
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,559
yeah

1342
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,520
i think that's about it for for that

1343
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,319
yeah

1344
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,480
um thank you very much and

1345
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,040
these are the technical aspects and and

1346
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,040
it's great to see that progress

1347
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,119
and i would also like to get your

1348
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,119
opinion about the ps lab and the topic

1349
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,480
of climate change so practically um we

1350
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,480
have heard about open hardware it can be

1351
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,240
more sustainable in regards to the

1352
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,960
production and to the logistics the

1353
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,640
delivery process and as well as the

1354
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,720
repairability um i would say and but

1355
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,359
what are the use cases now of our open

1356
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:21,680
hardware project here where they where

1357
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,079
can the pslab be used

1358
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,880
as a solution um to

1359
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,960
technology development or to hold

1360
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,280
climate change could you think of any

1361
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,880
potential um experiments or processes um

1362
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,800
where it could be useful

1363
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,319
yes absolutely

1364
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:39,680
i mean one one thing that you can do

1365
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,680
with this lab already

1366
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,599
is you can measure

1367
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,440
such things as

1368
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,520
carbon dioxide concentration in the

1369
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,680
atmosphere yes that's an example that's

1370
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,160
relevant to uh to climate change

1371
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,760
uh

1372
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,079
being able to to understand the world

1373
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,839
around you is

1374
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,720
essential i would say to to

1375
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,960
halt climate change

1376
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,359
so being able to i'm having some i'm

1377
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:06,880
hearing something from

1378
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,480
someone else

1379
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,160
right now i'm having some trouble

1380
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,800
yeah me too maybe from from backstage or

1381
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,440
something oh no problem i i muted them i

1382
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,280
hope it's okay all right thank you

1383
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,880
i nope still hearing them

1384
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,720
okay so i i don't know

1385
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,599
maybe i don't have the rights yeah we

1386
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,400
understand something

1387
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:35,200
yeah i think i think it's okay

1388
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,520
for me

1389
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,400
are there are there some questions from

1390
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,520
from the audience that we can switch to

1391
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,160
um i haven't seen any questions uh

1392
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,640
posted there's one question

1393
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,000
on the pad

1394
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,480
i found one question

1395
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,200
right now i see four or four not found

1396
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,520
so maybe the pet is getting restarted i

1397
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,359
don't know felix has one

1398
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,240
and the question that i find is um where

1399
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,559
can people find out more about this

1400
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,880
amazing project so they're asking for a

1401
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,520
link or something

1402
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,319
to find out more

1403
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,079
yeah

1404
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,760
okay so the the link is pslab.io

1405
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,480
you can just check it out

1406
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,000
[Music]

1407
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,359
please and um yeah exactly and

1408
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,760
um we uh coming to the end of this

1409
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,839
meeting as you see like i'm i feel it

1410
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,599
bad because like home foot

1411
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:37,760
didn't have the chance to to talk about

1412
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,079
like how we uh make community efforts

1413
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,480
and daniel um also

1414
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,240
didn't talk so much but like i think we

1415
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,760
have a couple of minutes

1416
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,480
left so um alex

1417
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,040
the experiments what can

1418
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,119
uh so like i was saying

1419
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:54,319
uh

1420
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:55,760
the pslab

1421
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,760
is basically uh

1422
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,520
it allows for uh citizen science

1423
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,440
uh

1424
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,200
so anyone with a psy device uh can can

1425
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,400
can do a lot of

1426
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,400
a lot of measurements uh to learn more

1427
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,000
about the world around them

1428
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,119
uh

1429
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,079
and and through that

1430
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,040
you know uh

1431
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,880
i i i i struggle to find any to come up

1432
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,559
with any like specific uh

1433
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,200
ways to solve to solve climate change uh

1434
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,960
through that because it's such a such an

1435
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:31,920
enormous

1436
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,079
enormous challenge and almost topic but

1437
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,079
but just by understanding

1438
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:39,520
it's by learning more

1439
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,000
yourself

1440
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,280
it's i think an essential step uh which

1441
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,119
the ps lab and other open hardware

1442
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,480
projects like it

1443
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,200
uh enable

1444
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,079
yeah

1445
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,000
absolutely so we need to understand the

1446
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,760
world around us

1447
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,440
in order to

1448
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,160
um yes solve the problems around us and

1449
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,599
i understand

1450
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:06,480
thank you very much alex and yeah

1451
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,839
we have um like a little bit left and i

1452
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,559
would like to ask daniel and hong fuk

1453
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,960
and to conclude this session daniel for

1454
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,520
example is working hard daniel maslowski

1455
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,119
is working hard on the

1456
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:20,400
desktop app

1457
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,480
and and how focus brings the community

1458
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,880
together so i'd like to invite both of

1459
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,440
you and for the final conversation to

1460
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,200
wrap up this

1461
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,520
yeah great get together and we also just

1462
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,040
saw the website thank you very much

1463
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,799
felix for showing the website you saw

1464
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,480
their pictures also of other

1465
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,640
contributors and

1466
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,359
yeah thank you very much for everyone so

1467
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,839
 daniel would you like to use these

1468
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,960
final minutes for uh yeah sharing a bit

1469
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,880
about the community and the development

1470
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,480
and how people can contribute maybe

1471
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,839
sure so um

1472
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:56,720
um

1473
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,880
yeah so um i think one first of all i

1474
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,040
just want to say that i'm so grateful to

1475
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,440
be here to be involved in the project

1476
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,440
and to be among um uh you for people

1477
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,240
like

1478
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,880
not only my friends but the people who

1479
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,240
give me a lot of um energy a lot of um

1480
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,400
inspiration to to continue what i'm

1481
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,720
doing in the community so i want to the

1482
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,480
second what i like such as now so

1483
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,359
climate change is a huge topic and it

1484
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,280
cannot be tackled by just a small group

1485
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,680
of people we need everyone involved and

1486
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,160
the conversation we are having right now

1487
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,119
is an example of how big your problem

1488
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,480
can be solved by um like sharing of

1489
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,319
technology sharing um of uh so-called of

1490
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,319
resources and i think i don't need to

1491
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,319
emphasize the example here anymore a

1492
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:46,880
kiwi and then you a vessel like already

1493
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,960
mentioned or alexandra there's so many

1494
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,799
applications around

1495
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:53,760
uh that we can um reference do but i

1496
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,760
wanted to make a call for the people out

1497
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,280
there and that we need more people we

1498
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,079
need more believers on like the the

1499
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,079
right to prepare open source hardware

1500
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:03,760
can change something and we need to join

1501
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,520
together in the movement in this

1502
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,559
movement

1503
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,599
um so daniel uh malonsky i i'm gonna

1504
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,119
pass it over to him i just want to say

1505
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:13,839
that i know daniel for several years

1506
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:15,839
also through the open source community

1507
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,720
and and never stopped like surprised us

1508
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,640
by all the the work that he'd done so

1509
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,520
far and continuously um supporting the

1510
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,839
project and um it's great to to to see

1511
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,000
so many people at this point of

1512
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,040
difficulty during covet uh we know that

1513
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,400
the last two years have been so

1514
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,000
challenging for every one of us um

1515
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,760
but still the people here in this court

1516
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,720
and a lot of people are there

1517
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,240
participate in in in the rc3 and we

1518
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,040
believe that by coming together we can

1519
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,520
do something good we can train something

1520
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,079
and i truly hope that this momentum

1521
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,680
continue uh to grow um among us and

1522
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,760
inspire more people

1523
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,760
daniel your final words

1524
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,359
thank you

1525
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:04,319
that's a uh yeah just just a a quick

1526
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:06,960
thought that just came to me uh because

1527
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,599
we've talked about understanding things

1528
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,079
and i'm absolutely aligned with alex

1529
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:15,760
here so it really helps if more and more

1530
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,760
people understand what's going on in the

1531
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,880
world

1532
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:19,599
to

1533
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:21,599
fight things like climate change but

1534
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,559
also well basically any issue right so

1535
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:27,280
reading news looking at things is always

1536
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,040
a very good idea

1537
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,920
and since the pocket science lab is also

1538
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,400
open hardware as we already discussed

1539
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,640
what you can do for example is you can

1540
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,200
look at the schematics that we have

1541
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,359
so that means you can get the full

1542
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:43,839
understanding about how the electronics

1543
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,520
are tied together

1544
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,400
and you can also transfer that to other

1545
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,799
electronics so it's not a very specific

1546
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:51,680
thing

1547
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,079
but lots of patterns that you see in

1548
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,559
electronics can also be found in other

1549
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,119
devices so if you are in that situation

1550
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,240
where one of your other devices breaks

1551
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,040
then maybe you can gain the knowledge to

1552
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,799
uh you know

1553
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:09,599
get that thing up and running back again

1554
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,280
because you may see the very same

1555
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,440
pattern also being used

1556
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,400
in pslab but the core difference may be

1557
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,559
that you actually have schematics there

1558
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,839
and then maybe you can conclude and see

1559
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,680
you know uh there are these and these

1560
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,839
devices here like you know specific

1561
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:28,799
resistors or capacitors uh which have uh

1562
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,559
especially effects if they are coming

1563
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:31,599
together

1564
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,920
uh or you know larger circuits like with

1565
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,880
mosfets for example we have many of

1566
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,799
these uh smaller

1567
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:39,839
let's say

1568
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:43,040
compound circuits also on that board and

1569
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,480
that can give you a very very good

1570
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,559
understanding of things and i can tell

1571
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,599
you

1572
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,520
for example with the sensors that you

1573
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,599
can attach to the ps lab you can find

1574
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,680
the very same stuff in your laptop or in

1575
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,400
your desktop computer also

1576
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,680
so that could be a very good motivation

1577
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,799
thank you very much daniel these

1578
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:08,000
were very good final words actually and

1579
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,839
thank you very much

1580
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,839
for all your work also bring the

1581
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:14,480
community together um and i want to

1582
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,599
point out

1583
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,280
that we have a code heat contest

1584
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,680
codeheat.org

1585
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,079
and where you can even like win some

1586
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,400
small prices if you contribute to the

1587
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,280
pocket science lab project and yeah as i

1588
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,960
said earlier you can find us um on

1589
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,119
pslab.io with all the links and you can

1590
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,760
find kiwi also like um on his website

1591
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,640
for the lions forge laser cutter and

1592
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,640
just like type it into your favorite

1593
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,480
search engine thank you very much for

1594

it was a pleasure like it was really

1596
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:48,960
condensed i love to get all the

1597
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,000
information here uh together and i hope

1598
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,520
we can meet again soon as our like

1599
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,280
regular meetups that we had from time to

1600
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,799
time before

1601
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,400
the corona times but it's great to see

1602

excited to get the next version of um

1604
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,040
pslab out there with everyone's work

1605
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,960
together and we know not everyone could

1606
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,280
be here today some people are like

1607
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,280
recovering some people are in a

1608
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,000
challenging time zone and but thank you
