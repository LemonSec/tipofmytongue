1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,470
welcome to the

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,230
lecture

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,290
think act is nokia so how we

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,180
west the technology optimal again

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,850
girl tells about asia and then

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,380
also believes that they are true the

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,210
lecture will be held by katalin part will be

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,070
translated the antigen

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,640
suns and kaster

10
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,620
we want to talk about fairy tales today

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,540
usually  not which ones

12
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,770
are somehow better followed,

13
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,090
but ones that shouldn't be

14
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,340
told and the problem is that china

15
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,250
today just doesn't believe that's a

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,230
fairy tale are

17
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,420
mostly if you had cash in

18
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,100
asia is this idea that this vision of

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,680
a place that's somehow in  the future

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,380
lies compared to north america or

21
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,500
europe but the problem is sometimes

22
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,840
when the

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,310
when the stories are told when they

24
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,500
are simply untrue and that is what this lecture is supposed to

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,229
deal with talk nice about things

26
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:29,560


27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,300
the europeans also believed her but are

28
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,390
just rubbish  an important

29
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,060
limitation is i would like to briefly

30
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,570
mention wa  s what here what this

31
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,360
contract is supposed to do what it is not supposed to do i

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,830
will not refute things completely

33
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,160
if someone somehow so

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,569
if we look at it over the last two years

35
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:55,599
if someone then we have

36
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,530
learned that if someone

37
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,750
really believes that then they are

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,929
resistant  immense day

39
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:03,369
as other people have

40
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:05,910
already taken over this day

41
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,840
that they

42
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,989
write down and explain indignantly but what i want to

43
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:13,360
do i will use these

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,500
examples to give you an idea

45
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,500
what

46
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,480
other people believe which just

47
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,580
becomes untrue now like in asia and  then

48
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,720
i would like to explain why that is a

49
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,540
problem and what the consequences

50
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,629


51
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,920
are because i don't refute it myself now, i

52
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,390
just have to believe myself

53
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,640
when i say that it exists and that it

54
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,030
's true, we have to believe

55
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,700
that and therefore that i do it now

56
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,930
written 12 times that asian

57
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,500
countries have invested heavily in contact tracing

58
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,030
to find out who

59
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,140
has been infected with corona virus and we

60
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,260
have claimed that the french are

61
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,070
gently thinking about replicating it and

62
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,340
then someone wrote in the economist

63
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:22,620
that this article in new york in the

64
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,660
new york times is

65
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,980
just plain wrong and that the asians are also working

66
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,630
with manual

67
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,819
tracking and they don't

68
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:33,120
digitally tracked electronic ones and i was

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
last in germany and there

70
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,850
people also talked about the fact

71
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,310
that according to paul systems in asia will be so

72
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,540
much more successful than our

73
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,819
own and i always wanted to

74
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,890
look at it and then

75
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,980
i tried to understand this article

76
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,930
and  then i looked for these apps

77
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,000
and what people

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,860
must have imagined

79
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,950
was just nonsense these apps don't

80
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,590
do all these things so

81
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,000
they imagined that when they

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,049
contact someone they would

83
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:05,610
automatically get a message

84
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,160
saying they did

85
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,780
that ended in possibly a

86
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,540
contact  sets were and

87
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,709
as I said I can't

88
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:15,329
refute that now but we have to believe

89
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:20,160
that until recently I

90
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,160
couldn't find anything in Asia in the direction

91
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,010
that this automatic tracking

92
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,770
of contacts with other

93
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,610
infected people doesn't even exist and

94
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,979
that's

95
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:35,960
why I

96
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,400
have there is one  very good article in

97
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,090
the new yorker that breaks it down

98
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,740
how the contact tracing

99
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,630
really works but this girl has become

100
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,850
so independent that it is

101
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,830
now somehow marketed here as a fact that

102
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,830
is relatively widespread and is

103
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,470
also believed and what draws me to

104
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,620
the  thing is there are little aspects that

105
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,169
we are so when i for example more

106
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,970
corrosive if you were a part was so

107
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,020
a year ago then you have to be in

108
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,780
quality when you enter and

109
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,940
in time the government tracked your cell

110
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,349
phone down to have its order

111
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:20,440
and as is so often the case when you have such a

112
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,909
tiny spark of truth then the whole thing takes on a life of its

113
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:23,680
own  d the

114
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,539
story of this election comes out has

115
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:29,020
nothing more to do with the whole thing and it is

116
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,580
complete nonsense that, for example,

117
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,190
I think that in Asia and 24 love

118
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,810
people are being followed all the time

119
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,190
that is simply

120
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,000
completely impossible

121
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,409
and

122
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,479
definitely in serious media  in

123
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,009
germany and also in the new

124
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:49,110


125
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,229
york times it was all

126
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:54,099
spread and accordingly

127
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:56,969
people hit

128
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,770
and this is very negative of the

129
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,719
chinese social credit system came up

130
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:07,659
around 2015 this is my second

131
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,240
example this is very good for what

132
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,389
i am going to explain to you  want because a lot of people

133
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,310
i have a quote from politics and where

134
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,819
it was about it was about the united nations

135
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:29,880
resolution on

136
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,440
[music]

137
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,500
and in which

138
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,360
they committed themselves not to use

139
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,069
artificial intelligence in order to use

140
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:41,560
social credit systems, among

141
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,650
other tourists  and here

142
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,870
the people constantly became that in front of it and that is

143
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,310
then also visualized that there  nn almost

144
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,690
every single citizen somehow has his

145
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,150
turning

146
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,630
point and then I have here a

147
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,250
German a German extract from

148
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,820
the world where

149
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,100
the author relatively in bright colors

150
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,710
describes the region of cameras and

151
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,100
thrones monitor the citizens at every

152
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,950
step they take and that  it all sounds

153
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,710
pretty scary but once again it's

154
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,360
just not right the idea of the

155
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,390
social credit system

156
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,880
the idea behind it is that all citizens are

157
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,600
somehow rated with a small on a

158
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,960
small frame

159
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,300


160
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,100
and there is like a point system of

161
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,750
30,000 points but that's true too

162
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,990
simply not if you have friends in

163
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,120
china and you ask them if you

164
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,670
have such a system with the

165
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,440
three

166
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,140
digits there is probably a credit system but it is

167
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,450
much less extensive and

168
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,800
if he asks you about the very

169
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,230
specific form

170
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,600
that is described in hebrew then it will be  that if

171
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,790
you simply deny that, the whole thing is relatively

172
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,740
complex and difficult to practice  look but

173
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,020
if you have this this

174
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,840
historical

175
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,700
idea that the state can know everything

176
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,100


177
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,160
and is direct but actually that vienna

178
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,680
as well as rightly picture that someone

179
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,250
filled out a few papers by hand

180
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,060
and that is south china morning

181
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,350
post described it like that  it works exactly

182
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,350
and they have

183
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,049
a social credit system in this city, for example,

184
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,400
but it

185
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,710
has the effects that are

186
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,710
presented in the western media

187
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,380
and if you are now the

188
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,560
kontakta prosecution is a protection against

189
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,060
you with the sketch of this slide

190
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,890
with it  you can read it and check it

191
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,330
and

192
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,140
and the truth about this social

193
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,060
it's just that it's complicated and

194
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,800
this simple narrative isn't real

195
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,350
this idea these people's stories

196
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,640
everyone sees it's just not true

197
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,260
so why do we believe these things

198
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,660
about asia why is that  possible for

199
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,730
me to

200
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,589


201
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:20,560
address a small person in Germany or the USA

202
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,320
and the gl  except that you think that the

203
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,600
rivers are like that in china with the

204
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,640
social sciences even if that's not

205
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,130
true

206
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:34,010
i say that a fancy house in the

207
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,950
sky above us

208
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,410
well france close there we

209
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,630
know it's wrong but these

210
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,100
other things about asia

211
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,130
believing in

212
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,600
i believe a very important training

213
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,060
is

214
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,350
we have to think about the stories like

215
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,640
science fiction that

216
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,230
actually happened a bit here

217
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,810
but writing this story

218
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,270
we get science fiction because people in little

219
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,110
facts little jokes of information

220
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,650
take that out of context

221
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:10,430
first document that says something very abstract in

222
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,920
the system the next polish

223
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,440
it

224
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,610
even if we only have documents that

225
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,800
the scales are that you tell yourself a lot

226
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,089
then just people do that because your

227
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,230
imagination has a firm place we have

228
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,230
these fairy tale hour things and those

229
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,990
are first of all tropical  fairy tales and there

230
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,209
it simply provides a canvas for

231
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:34,700
science fiction writing  especially for

232
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,259
the historical chance be meanwhile

233
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:40,779
the first was is and is a day

234
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:43,569
he must take with him these are not because the

235
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:45,839
screen is not that where you project

236
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,399
all your technology fears into

237
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,410
that is a real upright

238
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,499
people live who have real problems

239
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:56,679
but if  we're talking about it we're talking about

240
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:00,389
asia correctly it's very big

241
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:03,549
will also be a hunk or

242
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:05,970
place teamed up

243
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,369
granny in the meat eats trox to penetrate

244
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,579
that's

245
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,470
tough stuff said people

246
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,529
they don't believe but why you why you

247
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:19,269
should listen to me we

248
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:21,789
should think about this conversation  is simply that

249
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:23,139
several reasons there are bad is

250
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:25,869
not told now the first

251
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:27,309
reason first is the fascist and real

252
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:29,439
orientalist ish english german and

253
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,410
other media

254
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,639
technologies it exists in this

255
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,859
technology tallistic frame that is

256
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:36,539


257
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:39,519
so different to the places but not really

258
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,039
a real one  place people in asia should not have

259
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,230
these notions

260
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,819


261
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:48,329
not real mens  chen

262
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:51,910
and that will

263
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,800
soon be an imaginary place that is simply bad people because their western ideas will be stripped of

264
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,579
their

265
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:00,649
humanity and

266
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:01,910
therefore practical consequences above

267
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,069
all

268
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:06,170
that people in the west will talk about

269
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,759
how great democracy is but the problem

270
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,889
is when people from china go to

271
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:12,170
germany or the  coming to the usa or

272
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,779
reading the media the things are

273
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:17,149
absolutely wrong that we are their homeland they are

274
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:18,620
absolutely wrong because they

275
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,230
survived that in them and they trust

276
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,819
these institutions and that just makes it

277
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:24,680
harder to convince people

278
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,259
that democracy is cool i personally

279
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:29,209
have met people  and I know people in

280
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:31,399
china who came to germany

281
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:33,440
and then read german media or

282
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,519
see something like that because these are

283
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,690
obviously blatantly wrong things about china

284
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,810
and

285
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,709
and then take heed of it well the

286
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:46,670
western media are just the

287
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,829
same as the chinese one there's just

288
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:51,620
someone who has one  agenda who wants to

289
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,670
say something specific who can  you don't

290
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,880
trust and it's a huge problem if

291
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,910
you're someone who thinks that democracy

292
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,290
wanted to convince people

293
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,170
makes it exist and the second reason

294
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,840
is

295
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,280
that means that if

296
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,390
we imagine this huge problem

297
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,650
isn't really as real as

298
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,840
we imagine it then we haven't

299
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,620
really spending political energy

300
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,820
on these wrong things

301
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,980
then on real problems for

302
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,470
example one example one reason why

303
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,680
i just used politicians

304
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,800
because these principles have an

305
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,380
explicit ban on social scoring

306
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,470
system

307
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,090
i have a great impression that this

308
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,590
is written a  was decided because

309
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,270
people heard about this thing in

310
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,220
china and it doesn't exist

311
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,650
as imagined

312
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,630
the problem is that there are things that

313
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,820
are called that then it definitely

314
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,140
works problems a

315
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,380
technology but the problem is when you

316
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,050
ban things when you use energy  is a

317
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,140
trust in these principles and then something

318
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,030
that exists  animals then you don't

319
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,770
have that much energy for anything else

320
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,960
like energy

321
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,490
over

322
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,800
surveillance systems

323
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,840
so if we think of political

324
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,140
energies as a zero sum game

325
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,060
then

326
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,010
fantasies and using energy grids

327
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,450
powerfully to fight problems and i

328
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,220
personally think that's a problem for

329
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,770
activism it was  that bad

330
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,970
if we just imagine it as asia as

331
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,470
this fantastic historical

332
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,500
horrible place that is so different then

333
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,210
you will learn differently from others

334
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,420
too and

335
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,260
good and bad so

336
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:53,270
difficult for the good e.g. prevention

337
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,040
this

338
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,199
press about taiwan the

339
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,930


340
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,329
taiwanese pandemic

341
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:03,410
i answer  don't say that the animal should simply

342
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,060
copy taiwan because of course

343
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,000
all countries are different

344
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,560
but after six months i

345
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,620
think that something can be learned from that but

346
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,980
we just paint this huge place in asia tm

347
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,380


348
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,610
as a place that's completely different and

349
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,649
exotic that's typical after  you ca

350
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:23,990
n't learn  n and from which you can't

351
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,040
go yet can't take anything with

352
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,160
you but also

353
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,709
makes it harder to learn from things there

354
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:31,730
that go wrong

355
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,980
obviously asian countries are

356
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,740
countries real countries with all sorts of

357
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,949
problems for example capitalism in

358
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:42,100
a formula others they have for

359
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,360
profit companies south to

360
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,170
the  consumers about

361
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,279
this terrible technology and also

362
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,240
buy into the government and

363
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,970
things go wrong

364
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,329
the technology will

365
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:03,099
grow an example how big

366
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,950
industry in china

367
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,270
also the bad things that happen

368
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,630
if we just assume china this

369
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,230
magic is nearer place it wasn't it

370
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,160
so typical is just as fantasy

371
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,750
then becomes so bad historical

372
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,760
so different from us this is heavy power

373
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,380
so car fool to look at as otto

374
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,850
dipper employee country can learn

375
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,220
article a teenager and wbo route

376
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,770
must here

377
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:40,490
about the motion rim niche market and

378
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,770
its implications for human rights

379
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,420
there you have this  thing in german in

380
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,350
china about emotion recognition

381
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,520
but wrong example

382
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,720
buys these technologies and

383
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,830
promises what you can do with them

384
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,720
and say believe people believe that

385
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,850
then that's not the perfect

386
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,089
technique of the topia or the chinese state

387
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:07,790
suddenly the emotions of people from

388
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,160
their face face  but

389
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,170
it's probably an important

390
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,940
message about how we work with new

391
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:18,310
technologies and how technicians

392
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,890
try

393
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,000
to oversell the promises of what they

394
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,369
can do

395
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:27,300
and it's easy to learn from suns so

396
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,720
when other places

397
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,980
are transformed differently is

398
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,780
the 14 reason  what's bad

399
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,080
is sometimes

400
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,760
that means something like it could be

401
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,590
bad but it's not china so it's

402
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,140
okay

403
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,600
that's just bad luck

404
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,820
just that copies make you think of china

405
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,310
a good example is some of the

406
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,850
arguments facebook had in the last four

407
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,970
years couple  years ago i heard about the

408
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,540
techcrunch castle from 20 19 where someone

409
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,460
said

410
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,460
that you i

411
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,610
american tech comes from regulating

412
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,250
you should because you then belittle things from

413
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,730
the bad or good people

414
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,850
and the bad people always find

415
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,830
that of

416
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,790
course but if you the

417
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,600
bikers clear of

418
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,220
the problems but if they

419
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,240
break apart then the

420
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,880
chinese will come  so worse

421
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,280
and of

422
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,270
course the tech companies in europe and

423
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,280
the usa are also very bad and

424
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,460
it's quite difficult to say whether

425
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,440
chinese or

426
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,500
western european companies are worse overall

427
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,390
and so we just try

428
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,799
to hide our own problems with it

429
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,950
and regulate  ban

430
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,690
because of course we are not perfect

431
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,010
but at least if i china and that

432
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,900
is of course also very important what

433
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,080
others additionally is that it later

434
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,190
makes it easier to play

435
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,480
down the problem we

436
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,799
pass technology for example the monitoring of

437
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,970
course great for companies if you can

438
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,730
say it is of course not not  good

439
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,559
but that's the way it is  much less true than

440
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,230
what china is doing and when people now

441
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,330
have all this in the back of their minds this

442
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,880
picture of from this the story the children

443
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,409
accept that although they have never

444
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:29,480
seen it before they always have this

445
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,919
picture in their mind how terrible it

446
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,720
is and like everyone else  data will be siphoned off

447
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,970
all people will be laughed at and that

448
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,710
probably gives the wrong

449
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,070
people power and makes the problems

450
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,169
we are already seeing worse and the

451
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:44,480
fifth reason why it's still right or

452
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,840
why it's bad

453
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,360
again more about china than about asia

454
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,270
and basically  if you make yourself the

455
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,100
henchman of the chinese government and

456
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,629
its propaganda

457
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,780
but the binz that is about the force of

458
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,309
surveillance the chinese

459
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:10,130
government has

460
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,250
at its

461
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,530
disposal then you basically make your task easier because people are more

462
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,929
afraid of the chinese government than

463
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:20,150
you see  as a result they appear much more powerful than

464
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,049
they actually are and

465
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:25,340
thus create the image of an

466
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,539
allm  powerful actors of what they are

467
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:32,408
actually me

468
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,500
and their on because the task is that

469
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,350
you are afraid of the people

470
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,240
then we would then help them in principle

471
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,770
noren that is actually the task and

472
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,440
therefore only slightly so what should we

473
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,800
actually do

474
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,620
I just need  about it it's

475
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,510
important to talk about the fact that

476
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:00,500
things like this have solidified as fact

477
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,690
that are actually completely

478
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,040
made up these are things that we

479
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,350
would normally read as a novel

480
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,020
and these are so many things

481
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,000
that people believe when about asia and china

482
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,510
and the worst of it  is

483
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,280
still contradicting him and

484
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,840
even still believe that you somehow have a

485
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,750
propaganda yourself that is the chinese

486
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,120
and

487
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,010
it would be so much more important that we talk about the

488
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,450
right problems or the real

489
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,480
problems instead of

490
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,210
people making them up and

491
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,440
here we have already seen how  It's difficult

492
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,010


493
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,560
to get rid of these solidified fairy tales. Unfortunately, I have

494
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,640
no idea how we do it  should deal with

495
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,280
it i don't have a really good

496
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,020
answer how we can stop it

497
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,350
but

498
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,720
i also have one because there is no solution how

499
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,120
we can have a better technology

500
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,850
discourse it is best

501
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,950
to involve the chinese and the asians

502
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,980
so that we can learn how the

503
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,390
people there simply do it  just your life the

504
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,390
same as here too and

505
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:10,400
one thing i can offer

506
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:14,390
is the idea of

507
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,010
suggestions

508
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,210
to keep in mind

509
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,380
when reading something that

510
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,590
maybe it doesn't all have to be quite the way

511
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,560
you see it in front of you is there for

512
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,030
example a great podcast from chelsea

513
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,740
so i would like to give

514
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:34,220
some of the credit for it

515
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,560
this is a video so i can

516
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,120
say go back and look at

517
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,970
the slide it says it

518
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,950
is basically what you just said is

519
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,310
in a podcast episode of  you and

520
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:49,260
explained how to read news from china

521
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,170


522
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,490
or how to record one had to be

523
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,620
the news and  So that you get a

524
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,430
feeling for what is

525
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,390
reported truthfully and what is

526
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:03,450
just exaggerated or by and in

527
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,790
the specific example it was about the

528
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,790
social credit system and I can

529
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,320
only suggest that you

530
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,170
should also support your writings and one of the

531
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:17,340
first warnings is the

532
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,690
you could internalize if she

533
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,630
always has the same anecdotes

534
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:24,140
the example she mentioned was

535
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,480
that someone from a

536
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,570


537
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:33,150
university was affiliated with the klitschko because of his bad score and if you

538
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:36,720
look at it now in the

539
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,400
reporting by the foreign

540
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,500
media  about the conditions in hessia

541
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,630
it was always the same

542
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,680
reason because small details changed but

543
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,900
if it really happened now on the scale

544
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,670
that is a huge

545
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,830
country then it would have to

546
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,180
happen to a lot more people and it can’t be

547
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,730
that the same story over and over again

548
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,120
details are told and

549
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,950
then so it can  n its natural that it

550
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,180
still somehow has a core of

551
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,890
truth but that is maybe this

552
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,900
story really was and then that is the

553
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,330
core behind it but if it is the

554
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,560
same over and over

555
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,890
again then it can be so then it is

556
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,090
unlikely that it will affect many

557
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,680
people  or that is a general

558
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,930
phenomenon is further what she says is

559
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,940
that you urgently need to look at links and sources

560
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,900
so ideally look locally but

561
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,840
also in english

562
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,500
and then you can also

563
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,790
distinguish if you only ever quote a sign

564
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,820


565
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,300
then it is

566
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,440
likely that it is  bad substitute

567
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,830
if the kinetic sources are quoted

568
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,480
and

569
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,090
if super

570
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,720
these errors become independent

571
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,190
because if someone has introduced an error

572
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,170
and everyone else

573
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,630
writes about it from then on and uses it as a source

574
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,350


575
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,460
then at the end of the day the truth comes

576
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,990
out that's exactly like the one with the

577
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,480
contact after follow up because produce

578
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,490
a story published in the new york

579
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,420
times  and

580
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,060
then they claimed that there was this

581
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,340
massive

582
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,150
follow-up yellow

583
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,000
without writing any details about it

584
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,380
and that's why it's even more important that

585
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,660
you get

586
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,440
hurt on sources that are in the

587
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,510
local language or that are on site

588
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,630
and

589
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,070
if you can assume that we're

590
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,350
somehow a  there is a specification from the

591
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,530
government then there is a document in

592
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,480
the chinese bureaucracy it is unthinkable

593
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,030
that there is such a

594
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,590
general rule that there is probably no

595
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,200
document behind it

596
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,400
thirdly it is important that

597
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,710
these sources are somehow given a

598
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,690
context so if you are going to  For example, if

599
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,670
you have already read the translation of a

600
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,010
Chinese government document or of

601
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,070
Thailand or a Japanese

602
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,960
document, then it means that you

603
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,460
have not only understood what that

604
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,760
means because you lack the context.

605
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,540


606
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,890


607
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,200


608
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,340
I feel the same way  lost when I look at the

609
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,350
German text  en would and what is

610
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:13,860
even more important is that if the if

611
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,820
all these tech ideas are there they

612
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,110
are usually very specific

613
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:24,300
research or people who are out there

614
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,120
on site or who

615
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,660
should know talk to people who have done things directly on site

616
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,910
there are really good ones

617
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,590
there are also examples in germany, for

618
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,840
example, there are people who have

619
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,610
really looked at the details, who are

620
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,700
investigating carefully and i do

621
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,860
n't want to slam the media across the board

622
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,629


623
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:52,529


624
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:55,499


625
00:26:55,499 --> 00:26:58,080
know exactly how such

626
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,450
a technical and works

627
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,249
and another important limitation that

628
00:27:02,249 --> 00:27:03,919
i would like to make is

629
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,230
people understand just a part of

630
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,629
it so if i walk out into the

631
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:12,419
street and ask someone in

632
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:15,299
berlin, for example something about

633
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:16,470
german monetary policy and

634
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,080
installation  then it's very

635
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,999
unlikely that people will

636
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:23,070
see reason  would give a good answer

637
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,529
so if i happened to

638
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:26,460
catch one in the business

639
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,240
students then maybe i would get an answer

640
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,519
but a normal passerby on

641
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,889
the street would just talk nonsense

642
00:27:31,889 --> 00:27:33,210
and that you are now so

643
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,720
important to understand that

644
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,279
any randomly met people

645
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,889
there something about  asia tell because you

646
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:43,049
live your life that in

647
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:44,909
no

648
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:47,340
way qualifies you the experts on any subject for the countries and of

649
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,639
course you can

650
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:53,100
say anything about the av and you have as you

651
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,200
read in there

652
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,149
that

653
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:59,220
the governments in taiwan and china are

654
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,529
often quite bad

655
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:04,139
explain important functions to your citizens that is of

656
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:05,490
course an interesting aspect

657
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:06,409
but

658
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:09,470
you cannot generalize and

659
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,179
what you also have to consider you

660
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:14,879
should not generalize local

661
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:17,509
experiences to the whole country

662
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:19,169
that sounds kind of

663
00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:22,919
simplistic but china

664
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:24,480
is huge and asia is  really

665
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,210
again g  Bigger and just because something is happening

666
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,200
from that particular city like

667
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,029
this there is no way you can

668
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:32,070
assume it is happening across the country

669
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,689
and

670
00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:38,129
generalizing to all of Korea for example is going to

671
00:28:38,129 --> 00:28:39,830
be completely wrong and

672
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:43,159
it may just be that

673
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:46,110
the problem is just a local 1st  that of

674
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,450
the county that of the state

675
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,090
or whatever

676
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,899
or it can also just be the

677
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:53,519
specific city and you have to

678
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:56,960
separate that from two general had

679
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:58,539
experiences that you can have across the

680
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:01,720
country and i know for example has a

681
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,349
strong phenomenon that you have locally

682
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:07,659
experiments that run independently of the country

683
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:08,889
so is like trying

684
00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:10,210
different things in certain

685
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,609
regions and just because that's happening in that

686
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:14,409
region doesn't mean in any

687
00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:15,999
way that it works or happens across the country

688
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:19,840
and i mostly run

689
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,879
so many of them in parallel and just because

690
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:23,950
that all happen there, that doesn't mean that it's going to happen

691
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,450


692
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,619
all over the country afterwards  is set and

693
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:30,909
the last thing I would like to say, which

694
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:33,159
I find particularly important, is that you

695
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:34,720
differentiate between facts and

696
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,009
assumptions and things that are particularly vague

697
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:41,639
, e.g.

698
00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:44,259
is there something that someone describes that

699
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:45,820
is somehow something that someone knows

700
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,769
what is happening or is that someone

701
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:49,440
what  someone suspects that could happen

702
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,460
either now in the distant future and,

703
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,200
for example, the alliance has a new

704
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,599
technology, have the effects

705
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:00,999
already occurred or someone just suspects

706
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,379


707
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:06,419
that this could happen in the future and

708
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:08,679
is it already being exploited now, for example,

709
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:09,940
or also  not

710
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,320
or used against the

711
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,349
population or not

712
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:15,759
with that i would like to say it now and i

713
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:17,289
apologize there is

714
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:20,049
sunburn drained here but i

715
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:21,220
think it is important that we

716
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,859
start a discussion here and that we

717
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:25,989
lead it more broadly, especially when we are talking about

718
00:30:25,989 --> 00:30:28,690
authoritarian countries  talk like china and

719
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,239
that will definitely be about d  ie the

720
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:33,700
unpleasant things you talk about

721
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,470
really happen there and that we really don't put

722
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,440
any energy into these

723
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,029
things that actually happen and

724
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:41,470
not just things that could happen

725
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,929
or that people imagine

726
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,999
will happen and so let's

727
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:48,239
solve real problems and not

728
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:49,929
reinvent them  it doesn't actually

729
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:53,799
exist and that's why

730
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:57,389
I want to thank you very much. I'd like to buy Arminia again

731
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:00,369
and a few others and I'm

732
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:01,539
sorry if I've been away a bit now

733
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:03,759
and but it's supposed to be the first

734
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,870
conversation starter

735
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:08,660
or a start for a broader

736
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,730
discussion about why  people believe such

737
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:14,020
fairy tales and it wasn't like

738
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:18,010
that so let's get to the question part

739
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,169
hey

740
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,110
so

741
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:27,830
that was of course just a recording and

742
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,390
that was a few days ago and i

743
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,330
would like to add a few things

744
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,490


745
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,840
i have talked a lot about how you

746
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,179
can recognize that technology in

747
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:40,580
asia which you can tell is

748
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,010
not that good but i want one too

749
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:46,789
couple of examples of suits from the

750
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:50,289
other end of the spectrum viz

751
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:53,480
- works are particularly

752
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,179
good about the

753
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:59,110
about the labor camps

754
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:07,090
the book fossil links describes

755
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,289
that gives an incredible amount of

756
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:11,270
detail about the experiences

757
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:15,908
people have in the camp and

758
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:20,120
the other example what i bring

759
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,130
would like to be hit it is censored

760
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:27,490
this is a quantitative analysis of

761
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:31,270
china with its firewall

762
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,320
blocking and analyzing network traffic and

763
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,429


764
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:39,740
good example of how

765
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,549
research on such technological

766
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:45,110
relative you that the chinese have for

767
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,549
example can also be done and

768
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,640
even in such a way  a country like china is fine

769
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,350
and i wanted to add that again

770
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,080
and when you start with dj

771
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,090
thank you

772
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:06,030
thank you summit in talk that is the day

773
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:11,160
is sophia

774
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,280
batteries sei and translated by cattle

775
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,750
and capsules but we are still happy

776
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,470
about feedback about the hashtag hash ingo

777
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:22,000
we still have about twelve minutes

778
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,340
for the questions, the first ones are there too

779
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,730
already there

780
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:32,610
is the question as a

781
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:36,449
social club system and

782
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,670
would you say that this document

783
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,520
the documentation is not

784
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,730
truthful

785
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,710
i want to do the whole thing can similar about

786
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,520
the social credits

787
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,210
was i already did the banks

788
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:56,150
and i think a

789
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:59,340
lot of people are already doing research

790
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:03,510
and  I think if you want to know what

791
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,930
's really happening

792
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,989
there are really

793
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:12,030
sources and they've done a lot of research in

794
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,570
China themselves,

795
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,620
which also says what something

796
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,389
like that could look like in Europa

797
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,909
Place, that helps you

798
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:26,810
to get something there that makes sense  really going on

799
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:29,699
but it's so much it's not

800
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:33,418
productive find talking about this specific

801
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:35,210
details

802
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:39,770
there are things that happen

803
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,260
yes

804
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,800
this did a little more research than

805
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,050
I did

806
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:56,739
the second question the

807
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:59,109
stores and showed

808
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:03,740
five sources that take the system

809
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,260
apart

810
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:11,690
and the  person meant that can so

811
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,060
the question has just looked at the five

812
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,980
sources has claimed that

813
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,840
none of d  be peer reviewed by someone and

814
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,570
would like to know how credible the

815
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,480
sources actually are and he

816
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,440
might want a journal or

817
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,400
hope you look at the authors

818
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,089
of the article

819
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,330
who are 19 have researched social credit care

820
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:41,470
quickly

821
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,960
because i know at least two pages of the

822
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,350
dissertation

823
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,950
but as soon as the dissertation stops

824
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,750
working and is published again there

825
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,790


826
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:59,300
will be additional effort between accessing it

827
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,320
publicly

828
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,770
one impression i have is

829
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,360


830
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,530
wanting to have german research on something that

831
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,140
doesn't really exist

832
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,740
then it will be very difficult

833
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,950


834
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:22,660
blame yourself for a paper i looked at

835
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,960
is maybe rather banal

836
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,900
although very difficult

837
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,089
to find out if it really

838
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:33,950
leaves any impression if there is no

839
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,790
real evidence

840
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,829
if this phenomenon just doesn't have that

841
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:40,930
much

842
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:43,279
impact other than maybe real

843
00:36:43,279 --> 00:36:45,609
course

844
00:36:46,779 --> 00:36:49,930
then focus on other

845
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:53,230
phenomena that actually have something to do with a

846
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,390
chinese

847
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:57,390
ruler of

848
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,400
course too  good ethereal

849
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,510
creates what a

850
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,280
coup it's just important

851
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,930
to make these statements based on

852
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:17,460
information available

853
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,610
government documents tell he does

854
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:27,180
n't have the full story

855
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,510
thanks

856
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:33,610
here on my can there are no

857
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:36,220
further questions for now i have

858
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,609
but one more

859
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,470
that those before again  roll

860
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,760
afterwards or should all the

861
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,180
screenshots

862
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,680
if people don't drive fast enough

863
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,370
to the screen then erich denzler will

864
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,030
scotch

865
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:58,940
but i won't rev up everything sorry

866
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,850


867
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,350
mostly it was really just random

868
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,900
pictures that always somehow

869
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,290


870
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,940
matched this can only recommend everyone

871
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,680
to follow katharinen on twitter  part as a

872
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,900
cutter and now there is

873
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,940
a

874
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,770
known question so and again talk about

875
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:24,620
how difficult it is

876
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,310
to do sociological research on china oh

877
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:31,330
yes it is clear on the challenges

878
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:34,569
above all on china

879
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,859


880
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:46,970
especially when it comes to

881
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,540
horseback riding the

882
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,650
big problem is

883
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:56,599
the intention  is that nobody really

884
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:58,460
mo  meanwhile you can go there for two

885
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,710
years

886
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:03,170
so i think most of us know that

887
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,799
we have

888
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,859
is just two years out of date

889
00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:13,359
knowledge because no one can go there

890
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:19,270
but it

891
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:22,970
is true that foreign researchers are looked

892
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,520


893
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,089


894
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,299
at with a bit of suspicion, especially when it comes to things that are

895
00:39:32,299 --> 00:39:35,559
absolutely politically important to me

896
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,200
what is important then is

897
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,310
there is also talk about the fact that there

898
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,870
and was already stopped because that

899
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:56,339
was classified as a danger

900
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,460
made you not sensitive are

901
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,510
probably much easier

902
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,450
skating just never really

903
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,579
secret the government tried

904
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:13,770


905
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:17,140
to keep itself secret that is a  fair

906
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,260
secret that happens in china

907
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,339
it really depends on the topic

908
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:28,410
but in

909
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:32,190
general it has become difficult

910
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,690
to talk to people in china because

911
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:37,240
people simply distrust western researchers inside

912
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,868


913
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:47,010
basic research on the ground so what

914
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:52,230
's up mark robert's work

915
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,299
examples

916
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:57,780
of how to do it differently  can

917
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,849
other example is

918
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:05,490
that you can have a look at some point

919
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:10,379


920
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,270


921
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,280
also include the plus point in

922
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,280
government

923
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,780
documents also documenting what is happening there also an

924
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,460
innkeeper has actually already

925
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,800
documented the Chinese government that

926
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,720
it also happens privately more often I am

927
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,740
not saying that it is easy and they

928
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,070
say it has definitely become more difficult

929
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:36,190
so they are allowed to

930
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:40,160
but that is  it's also important to recognize

931
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,210
what you can do a lot it's

932
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:47,270
also really important to catch up a lot

933
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,670
as well as look at social media if there's

934
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,680
a phenomenon there's a lot of people and

935
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,170
influences china then talk

936
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:58,980
about social media too until it's not a secret by

937
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,640
10 that's how it crystallizes

938
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,109
also with example is for example

939
00:42:04,109 --> 00:42:06,560
this

940
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:10,460
thing for

941
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,400
autumn contact tracking was

942
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,140
probably actually used the cell data of

943
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:19,009
people

944
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,180
whether they had met because of

945
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,150
but the topic was so

946
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:29,630
sensitive that it infected all sorts of people

947
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,490
then people

948
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:33,750
started making fun of it

949
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,859
and  to make forest about it

950
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,350
a  Even on the ground it's difficult, that's

951
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,320
difficult, but there are so many other

952
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,230
ways to know what's happening in China, to

953
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:52,100
find out what's happening there,

954
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,530


955
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:59,700
the simple referee

956
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,860
bastian scores and whether it's him that points

957
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,350
were deducted or something

958
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:06,670
and whether points were deducted for certain things

959
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,590


960
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:11,250
whether that would be something for the power

961
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:14,770
what might be very good very easy

962
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:17,670
to verify that

963
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,140
well i have another

964
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,779
question

965
00:43:26,779 --> 00:43:32,369
so a murder of the fund he that makes the

966
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:35,309
government look much more powerful

967
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:37,829
than it actually is

968
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:39,960
and the question is whether the government does that

969
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,000
not even throw yourself out as propaganda

970
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,369
to make yourself more powerful that

971
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:46,670
depends

972
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,950
i mean

973
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:53,569
on a scientific point

974
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,160
i know the

975
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,359
situation of power

976
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,599
propaganda

977
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:05,000
doesnt really change what people think

978
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,309
just the government

979
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:10,670
presenting itself as stronger

980
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,380
and

981
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,339
people dont really believe  what the

982
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:15,630
government says but they're just

983
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,780
scared

984
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,849
because the government  g this

985
00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:22,770
giant fight europe can because can

986
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:24,930
campaigns almost ready to showcase are strong

987
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,930


988
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,210
and

989
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:30,960
built they

990
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,430
probably just look stronger than they

991
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:35,270
really are and

992
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,150
just want to look powerful and dangerous

993
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,940
and that's probably one of

994
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,569
those things

995
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:50,720
that

996
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,009
your governments just like to

997
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,790
do but you have any more questions  another

998
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:01,030
short anecdote

999
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:04,700
about the reversed myths

1000
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,810
maybe myths about

1001
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:09,910
europe and

1002
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:13,340
america that are told in asia or is

1003
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,760
a good question

1004
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:20,030
is just white there is nothing an

1005
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:21,790
interesting

1006
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:24,340
general anecdote

1007
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,359
about the different worlds we

1008
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:27,430
live

1009
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:31,660
in china goes

1010
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
but

1011
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:42,880
in china

1012
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,009
there is  they believe that kopietz was delivered from

1013
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:49,230
america to china

1014
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:52,420
and that is perhaps the most important

1015
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,250
answer but a good example of this

1016
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:59,400
is ideas about the other places are actually a reflection of each other

1017
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,539


1018
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:08,069


1019
00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:12,220
unfortunately this explains our newspaper many

1020
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,180
many thanks for this very

1021
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,379
interesting lecture
