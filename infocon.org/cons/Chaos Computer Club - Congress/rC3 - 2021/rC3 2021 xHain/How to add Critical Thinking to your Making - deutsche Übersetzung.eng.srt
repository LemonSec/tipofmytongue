41
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,690
we last year we had a

42
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,419
bit of a shock about

43
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,240
critical thinking and critical doing

44
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,500
the making and the answers we

45
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,450
got got the lesson but

46
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,560
really really big and

47
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,890
in that

48
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,450
context i'm a

49
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,910
technical technical person i have

50
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,530
a small parliament  singapore i

51
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,820
help out with make us bases and im

52
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,060
a coffee

53
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,040
ride or caffeine

54
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,340
others say

55
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,630
think some people on the team are shooting

56
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,000
and already seeing ours or slides we

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,100
are in the first slide and the

58
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,710
second one I guess you guys are seeing a picture of

59
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,340
an actual stage one on

60
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,800
one  actual complete as well as genia

61
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,900
our

62
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,540
last year de  n defined the term critical

63
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,110
critical macon making

64
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,930
now so two years

65
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,230
ago so now before the pandemic so now 100

66
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,360
years ago so last time we

67
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,160
talked about it we

68
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,090
defined now as

69
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,420


70
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,890
adding critical thinking to creating makeup and there are

71
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:39,708
hundreds of ones  another definition

72
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:47,750
and what it reflects best is

73
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:53,700
that we want to build something that has

74
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,920
meaning and makes sense and

75
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,840
for the contact by you am and in the

76
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,819
definition changes and the further

77
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,890
you go in the more sense it

78
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,500
should we have so more jobs

79
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,470
should it could

80
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,510
you can think about how that

81
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,970
helps people

82
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,039
personalization that is that that

83
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,250
is the

84
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,660
definition of critical shadows

85
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,570
that is an

86
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,300
easy to understand

87
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,880
explanation nor an oil trade the concept

88
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,550
and that's why this whole

89
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,039
concept is interested in creating the different areas

90
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:41,900
of a critical  could

91
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,900
strongly recommend comeback

92
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,910
but i recommend that to you  talk by

93
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,340
regina looking at us

94
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,800
for some one hour very

95
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,289
comprehensive

96
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:58,270
consideration

97
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,509
topic and today i think we

98
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:04,520
're going to focus on what has happened since then

99
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,580
what is

100
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,990
behind the concepts

101
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,060
the third before here we see one of the photos here we see

102
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,400
here one

103
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,190
of the photos what's also in the dryer

104
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,530
but everything is shown was about

105
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,659
collecting information when we could

106
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:26,870
still learn each other if possible with the

107
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,580
big blue mobile laboratory of

108
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,880
the workshop i would like to spend a few

109
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,460
minutes in the garden talking about what

110
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,580
happened at the last meetings and

111
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:45,440
what a pandemic in relation to the

112
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,010
classic  conway king

113
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,120
happened that will have

114
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,599
evolved and was now looked at from the outside

115
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:55,000
that will say

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,919
yes i think we have a

117
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,620
phenomenal

118
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,080
along

119
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,400
the whole bands makers and create

120
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,949


121
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:12,020
new visibility through the pandemic that has

122
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,240
great

123
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,150
potential in this reaction to it but  when

124
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,970
we remember how is above all

125
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,009
yes, now the time is gone because

126
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:24,910
of corona but when you

127
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,710
think back, for example,

128
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,340
emine had safety and

129
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,889
protective masks were scarce and people took advantage of

130
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:36,639
the situation and got

131
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,860
involved this time not just

132
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,229
social work because everyone who had

133
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:45,500
skills or

134
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,509
had to somehow  found ways to get

135
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:50,030
involved and participate and it was

136
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,990
based on a worldwide

137
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,539
basis not only with the availability

138
00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:00,169
to protect the equipment but also

139
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:04,060
so that people who use e.g. 3d printers or

140
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,250
other application processes can

141
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,750
try to adapt these skills

142
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,639
to what was needed and  it's

143
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,620
very impressive

144
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,889
that this has happened on a global basis

145
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:17,900
and that we have also

146
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,750
connected all these

147
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,509
adjustments and digital

148
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,680
digital shifts or ordering

149
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,460
of the digital what affects ours and

150
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,680
moving away from the physical viewing has

151
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,469
happened and i miss you very much

152
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:36,500
and i'm looking forward to it  still  a time

153
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,030
and we can meet again for each other

154
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,889
i am still optimistic

155
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:41,289
but we

156
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:44,240
are not over the hill yet and with

157
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,030
the breakdown is still very real and

158
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,198
me what we still

159
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,030
answer but my question what has

160
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,979
changed since then is mine  feeling is

161
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:58,300
that the people they are involved

162
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,190
people who are otherwise rather isolated in

163
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,469
their

164
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:05,229
producing delicious

165
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:08,080
babbels or chambers or the ticker you are now

166
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,289
more recognized and under because of their

167
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:15,440
skills and social colorful na and

168
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,840
i would like

169
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,948
to appreciate this potential even more

170
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,500
delicious in the future  and hex rays it was right

171
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,330
at the forefront like many other

172
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,480
gentlemen of ace germany and

173
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,730
to produce exactly this of this protective

174

183
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,130
if you

184
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,720
can install with big buttons instead of a

small button or small things that you can

the topic of this madness from the

carried out together which was then also

00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,730
accepted by the european

political machinations here

227
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,860
that was after the  wrote about this motion last congress

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,480

[music]

230
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,970
we have technical difficulties we

231
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,180
are

232
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,730

open to answers and the resources that combine very well with the means values that we then both want to contribute

236
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,660
so we picked a few things

237
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,560


238
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:21,290
like equality and that we are young talents

239
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,509
such applications always

240
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,660
have to

241
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,389
boost the sponsors the gold ban somehow and

242
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:30,819
we have also

243
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:34,279
chosen so that i than as a

244
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,720
broader and more general

245
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,949
today i would like to show you a

246
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:44,689
bit of what we have already done

247
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:46,189
because we are now at the end of the

248
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:49,599
first act project

249
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,119
want book  n show that we have managed so far to

250
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,220


251
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,709
give you a little insight

252
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:00,139
when we did the gender-specific

253
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:02,209
part that they had worked in

254
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:05,410
different places

255
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,959
and I have now brought two examples

256
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,259
of case studies that the

257
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:18,259
waldseer are published about help

258
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:23,319

00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:31,369
there are many many others i am

262
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:34,959
very excited here

263
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:43,240
very pretty ones so of course

264
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,420
when you think about gender

265
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,290
many people clearly believe that it

266
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,480
is only because women

267
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,959
girls are

268
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,189
encouraged and allowed in max payne but

269
00:13:58,189 --> 00:13:59,629
in reality it is  it's about the complete

270
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:01,519
spectrum the complete differences

271
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,879
of spectrum that really everyone has

272
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,399
a pleasant a pleasant space

273
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,149
on site no matter whether male woman male

274
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:14,059
female or everything else and in this

275
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:17,640
special case it's so nice to

276
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,730
be and they

277
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,260
don't want to tell us now

278
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,180
would we only for women

279
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,640
or only  for a piece in particular

280
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,450
a special type of nerd we

281
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,400
really want is inclusive and

282
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,430
sure one for everyone that lots of

283
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,500
small examples here and online you can find

284
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,440
more and

285
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,110
our and

286
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,770
mostly about the love we have to report to

287
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,420
the european union

288
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,940
then take  we have small sections of it

289
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,750
and publish it in a

290

format designed for people to

291
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,750
interact so it's easier to

292
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,030
read than a corresponding one immediately

to contribute to the next steps

and the style in the next time in

that is where we

together in the area so

316
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,410
about the  open

317
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,150


318
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,750

00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,520
practices in global what moment but

321
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,340
we are also in the process of giving

322

[music]

323
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,990
lectures like this one right now

324
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,899
about what we found

325
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:38,519
out about that too so how  also or

326
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,100
the corresponding colleagues of ours who made

327
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,620
the critical so you

328
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,420
see in the next foreman

329
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,420
seville area accessibility will be operative

330
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,940
so there is this openness

331
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,750
of a very our core value and the

332
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,910
basic values like but also in the

333
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,459
picture probably

334
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:01,649
there are many  many different

335
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:04,260
ways to interpret this word so w

336
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,910
we can promise about open bunnies for example

337
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,150
which is of course one

338
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,420
of the most obvious for you

339
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,730
all to watch through now because it's also

340
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,040


341
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,329
something we talk about on the chaos completely very

342
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,020
often

343
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:26,179


344
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,040
opening up for everyone

345
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,440
would be just very simple things to

346
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,960
do  being able to tackle things being able to do things

347
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,780
easily for yourself that

348
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,390
is a very important part of open

349
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,870
bunny then we also found other

350
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,410
aspects that also occur in this literature is

351
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,919
open openness can for

352
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,660
example finally be read as an

353
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,059
infusion or empowering people to do so

354
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:58,340
people

355
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,550
opportunities to give

356
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,790
general users can but

357
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,440
minorities will go here all kinds of

358
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,850
inclusion and

359
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,559
eg

360
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,020
[music]

361
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,330


362
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,470
but

363
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,539
[music]

364
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:25,269
it may not be that going to

365
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:27,169
think about but it is also very

366
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:30,669
important is economic growth

367
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:34,929
in a global

368
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:38,320
cadres so have new ones too  business

369
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,070
models openness in the

370
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,440
business models a

371
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,729
lot of innovation  ion strong innovations 4

372
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:52,629
and in the area and that already

373
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:55,970
many and many before the long

374
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,970
-distance tension is the the tension that

375
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,529
we have seen the Rhine and

376
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:02,379
over is

377
00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:05,529
there are many tensions between

378
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:08,379
different economic

379
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:12,700
standpoints, for example

380
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,210
people some people want want  made me decide to do it

381
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,099
for free time

382
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:21,229
reasons or for other capitalist reasons

383
00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:23,859


384
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:28,009
so what offers a certain potential for tension

385
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:31,159
where you have to tackle it then

386
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:36,369
there are apartments that are coming

387
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:39,919


388
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,639
that will shape the future if you see the whole thing as a revolutionary movement

389
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:45,409
so the big change

390
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:47,590
for the future, e.g.

391
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,690
towards the capitalist system

392
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,320
and then of course there are the

393
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,859


394
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,789
most important tensions that the tension between

395
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:01,190
an individual view of the world

396
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,109
individual interests of the collective

397
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:04,929
collectivist

398
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:07,519
orientations i do what is good

399
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,869
for me i do what is good for

400
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:12,279
the society  haft is also important

401
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:15,729
is that you look at the whole thing as a point of

402
00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:19,039
discussion so are

403
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,590
so this is the scientific

404
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,769
results that we have found in

405
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:28,149
this article of course all of

406
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,709
course much more in there

407
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,440
now say something if i will add to

408
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,620


409
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,159
that so you want all of that  of course brings

410
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,539
more examples of

411
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:55,710
practical approaches in the academy that

412
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,380
also

413
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,380
people

414
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,570
that is a bit unclear there have war to

415
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,269
talk about but add ours so

416
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:08,159
you have already said to go into it

417
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,289
i think the nature of our work is

418
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:14,210
very

419
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,549
practical and

420
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:21,690
that often with too much resistance or

421
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,240
restrictions  which now remains where

422
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,190
iran

423
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,720
mpc's have been

424
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,279
discontinued and i hope

425
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:30,830
that we'll find more

426
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:35,340
examples people will take

427
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,230
a more constructive

428
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,399
approach to it because we've seen

429
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:43,340
for example

430
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,279
and a lot of it is also emerging

431
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:49,230
in the understanding and

432
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,659
imagination of  people people who otherwise

433
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,860
might not be so inv  olvier are

434
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,289
in a place where I work

435
00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:01,279
where I am

436
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,659
only once a week or at the

437
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,000
weekend

438
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,110
and we see them again

439
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,690
the freely conditionally but lately

440
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,840


441
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,100
we have seen that the performances and the demands of

442
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:23,399
the work are becoming more and more of a

443
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:26,399
whole

444
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:29,059
i feel more motivated and doing the

445
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:31,909
work

446
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:37,020
is also open whether the social sharing and

447
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,240


448
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,800
analyzing and

449
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,840
reproducing what other people have done together and he is

450
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,230
welcomed by those

451
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,450
it's not so much an exciting idea

452
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,450
where you tell people first  explaining and

453
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,880
in indian culture it is

454
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,760
important

455
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,400
to provide understanding and so

456
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,250
willingness to others that is very

457
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,710
impressive

458
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,610
and my my idea but the

459
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,840
people's exhibition is changing and

460
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,810
wanted are open part of what they have

461
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,110
achieved and don't wait until

462
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,970
something works  and then shares it

463
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,410
so the process much more openly with

464
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,540
the asian

465
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,100
sensibility you don't share the

466
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,420
i either  identity the species on the way there

467
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,520
one both he for himself or only

468
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,920
a very narrow circle and that there never

469
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,160
documented or shared because I

470
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,350
now see more examples of where that is

471
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,660
paid yes I believe that it is not

472
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,590
just the Asian

473
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,650
mentality that is the problem  we have everywhere that

474
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,580
people have so many projects or

475
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,480
products that the people the manufacturers

476
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,480
prototypes

477
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,749
[music]

478
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,830


479
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:21,530
problem when we met in 2009 10

480
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,579
[music]

481
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:28,039
innovation

482
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:30,720
ambassador conference and rome

483
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,090
met and we invented what is

484
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,000
shown here next slide he invented

485
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,190
so to speak the principles of

486
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,120
sustainable has in the shadows

487
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,289
the sustainable or

488
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:48,990
oriented do you want to say about it

489
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:53,840
and say yes the process behind it was

490
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,700
very

491
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,950
interesting the energy we had in the

492
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,929
room at the time discussed as a model

493
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:03,770
for me at

494
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,870
least i understand it is to stay tuned to

495
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,990
the  the challenge was these

496
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,419


497
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:14,450
different perspectives that came together

498
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,039
to bring together with and all

499
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,830
at the same time because the floral

500
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,480


501
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,090


502
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:24,890


503
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,530


504
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:32,120
gathering there is a very high diversity and the people who work on it between mecca space & co working spaces

505
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,520
startups and a hacker space

506
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,460
are very socially committed and it

507
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,059
tends that they of course then

508
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:45,059
they  adapting to local happenings and

509
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:49,280
that's why everyone has a very special

510
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,860
view our game view and that

511
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,159
has a whole a whole world of new

512
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,370
possibilities

513
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,929
and it all came together in this

514
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:03,650
room after we got over

515
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,960
that initial

516
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,760
shock it all came

517
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,919
together and it was challenging

518
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:12,539
putting it all together and

519
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:15,530
understanding it and that was very

520
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,240
messy socially and now of

521
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,890
course it's written down nicely neatly and cleanly

522
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,710
but the aspects of that

523
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,090
are his reputation they

524
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,780
are the reality in the painting group

525
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,520
that was all right before the

526
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,090
pandemic the idea of

527
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:40,850
this global perspective that  you bring

528
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:44,030
them through you  rch this she

529
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,800
helps us get through times of crisis

530
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,410
is phenomenal could

531
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,180
go on talking for hours now

532
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,830
but don't say what

533
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,580
yes thank you

534
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,790
or that's phenomenal

535
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:04,150
try to reproduce the legacy of

536
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,060
part job

537
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,740
and

538
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,020
produce online and on big digital

539
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,850
whiteboards together too  write but

540
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,230
I'm very happy that we

541
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:24,130
were able to build together so principles

542
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,110
that make sense

543
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,450
parts

544
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,580
like that power

545
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,700
for sustainability

546
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,010
finds the ecosystem or local

547
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,650
ecosystem

548
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,210
services

549
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,730
and

550
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,710
local needs

551
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:51,200
based on these things

552
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,620
we built the project

553
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,860
because every year three months away  was and

554
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,100
can watched it often and

555
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,940
then recharged batteries

556
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,860
recharged only the project team updated here

557
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,970
and that could soon be

558
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:13,060
adjusted too so that we are now

559
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,520
local and connected we have a

560
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,810
social background which

561
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:25,010
we emphasize are adding critical flexible

562
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,860
things to

563
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,990
the pact  for his so an influence

564
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:34,700
and buildings have fun and do

565
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,700
business

566
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,360
on the whole it's always important

567
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,990
that you see this slide that

568
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,870
we're going to work on now in the critical

569
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:55,280
sharp criticism comes in

570
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:00,320
europe and also built one

571
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,679
that we're working on that I'm now working on over

572
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,570
the next few months and

573
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,730
when I  now here on the

574
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:09,710
next slide

575
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,620
the critical shadows

576
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,729
are showing more the mentors program

577
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,770
program

578
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:22,190
starting in january and

579
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:25,520
we will see

580
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,160
there throughout the year accompanying on

581
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,260
the next slide who will do why

582
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,059
that we have done a study

583
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,600
and again a bit but i noticed

584
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,230
that  the openness that

585
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,900
everyone in the globe's global innovation

586
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,140
community has spoken so again

587
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,690
very nice to see you again and that

588
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,059
the economic opportunities that the

589
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,440
economic opportunities of the

590
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,540
girl is also very

591
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,850


592
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,920
interesting in

593
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,840
low income countries but even in

594
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,850
countries with higher  income than many

595
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,460
many voluntarily  gene projects

596
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,470
sees projects that can also be

597
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,910
done in free time

598
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:16,620
we would like to find a way to continue

599
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,830
working on what is possible without

600
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,110


601
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,650


602
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:29,400
adding no economic background so once again

603
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,770
inclusion became a very important

604
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:35,490
topic to include eg topic having less

605
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,140
technical skills or

606
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,600
that people create

607
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,100
to make it more accessible for people

608
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,510
with physical disabilities and

609
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:51,140
we're trying so see

610
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,570
we're trying

611
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,220
to bring those values from front fork second so that's

612
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,690
one of those online keywords that we've

613
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,030
created so as an example of what we

614
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:03,000
want to do in this project so we

615
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,830
have we

616
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,110
we've been having workshops here throughout the summer and hopefully we'll have

617
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,900
a great demo group at the end of that as well,

618
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,120
a

619
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,470
demonstration for a week ahead where we'll also be

620
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,490
giving out rewards to people who have

621
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,960
participated and we're

622
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,280
still in the final stages together is

623
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,610
this program closed  design and

624
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:32,280
and that the kleve also prepare the call for submissions

625
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,669
, so of course

626
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:38,370
we invite you to take a

627
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:42,480
look at one and space and

628
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,850
to apply for this program right away or

629
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,679
to share it with others who

630
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:49,280
might be interested in it and

631
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,230
last but not least I would also like to say a

632
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,860
few lines  with you a few

633
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:58,610
tools a few tools and

634
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,140


635
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:03,690
information i.e. things that we will prepare in the

636
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,610
next few months so

637
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,700
want toolboxes for researchers

638
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,690
but also for make-up

639
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,390
tools for learning on a piece of hardware

640
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:21,540
i hope you all know that if

641
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,080
not take a look  get into this open hardware

642
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,049
meka program this is a great resource for learning the basics

643
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:31,530


644
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:34,669
of open hazard

645
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:37,190
we have also collected that in the

646
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,450
next image many many

647
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:45,919
resources for you to look at

648
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,440
and this is the first page of this

649
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,210
long list  of tools and sources

650
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,249
and

651
00:32:54,249 --> 00:32:57,379
add and the last

652
00:32:57,379 --> 00:33:00,669
bit i want to share with you is you  e

653
00:33:00,669 --> 00:33:03,559
self-reflection about yourself

654
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:04,899


655
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,830
unfortunately doing this as we do a

656
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,450
slider tool on the second page

657
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:13,759
where we also look into the different

658
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:16,600


659
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,499
categories of peace in principle in the basics

660
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:24,109
and we use this tool as soon as

661
00:33:24,109 --> 00:33:27,919
we get started with the winter program that

662
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,070
people think about how  you yourself

663
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,109
create a god you yourself create this

664
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:35,230
yourself stand

665
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:38,799
and kind of like a game and

666
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,259
there so this idea told along

667
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:44,269
with a few other people in singapore

668
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:46,179
about

669
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:48,830
the growing species you

670
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:51,909
can spin spin the bottle handy

671
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:55,700
and one by one  real

672
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,730
candidates answer the question and on the

673
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:02,659
next page you go again was

674
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:05,480
created at the end from some

675
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,699
messy polishing and

676
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:13,579
and as it evolved over

677
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:14,989
time and on the

678
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:18,199
next page you'll see some

679
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:22,030
guide cards to help you

680
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,530
think about it  do you

681
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,260
ask yourself should wa  s i what your

682
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,609
next plans are or how you

683
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:33,609
think about it

684
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:37,659
then hold back and

685
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,589
eventually you'll have kind of a

686
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:42,340
deck of cards to work

687
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,960
with and so we're going to have a

688
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,719
workshop on that where we're going to have a

689
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,699
conversation with other people in mecca space exactly on

690
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:51,300
that topic  be entertained and

691
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,750
then on the last page you will see how

692
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,030
to follow the team on a project

693
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,849
and how to contribute to the project

694
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:04,300
how to join the hacking community of the

695
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,990
maps at the moment and

696
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:10,270
we will soon be calling out on

697
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,220
these platforms for  our

698
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,380
program now next

699
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,430
year's program will start soon

700
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:21,540
tomorrow if everything goes well and

701
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,760
if you look at this lecture like this

702
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,619
it might even be there

703
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:28,980
already

704
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,570


705
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:34,240
so karl can come now hello many

706
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,680
many thanks for the lecture

707
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,869
we have one  few minutes for

708
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:44,170
a penalty and answer table and i

709
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,730
want to remind

710
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,680
you again to ask questions  does not know about this

711
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,920
lecture with twitter and mass from

712
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:56,430
with the manufacturer rt3

713
00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:02,700
and you can also ask questions in the

714
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:07,359
erc in the canal 13 dash found and

715
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,240
we already have simple questions and

716
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,330
many are already about it although

717
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,580
you can find more information

718
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,550
So you said the website is that

719
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:21,839
everything can be done everything you reported about being

720
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:25,170
set up,

721
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:28,270
not everything has already been published

722
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,619
. Of course, the matter is still being worked on

723
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:35,200
and if someone who can hardly wait

724
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,570
,

725
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:40,229
we can do without burning

726
00:36:40,229 --> 00:36:43,059
work packages and sharing them with people

727
00:36:43,059 --> 00:36:45,549
but we work all the time or

728
00:36:45,549 --> 00:36:47,170
profit all the time so further

729
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,009
under website

730
00:36:50,009 --> 00:36:54,430
so how people have to follow each other on

731
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:57,039
twitter and look at their website

732
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:00,609
and straight away the next question

733
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:03,640
i have is what is vogel tag

734
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,999
exactly will

735
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,759
answer now

736
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:11,910
this is one  interesting question

737
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,799
contra bahn how to ask it

738
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,900
probably different foods

739
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,430
as a new password  or

740
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,779
just defined in venture capitalist

741
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:24,119
or the

742
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,680
capitalist

743
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,549
investment areas i would

744
00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:29,799
say it is definitely a disruptive

745
00:37:29,799 --> 00:37:32,400
one that

746
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,650
disrupts perspectives and if you

747
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:39,400
look at the day of the business

748
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,799
then there are devices that are never

749
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:46,529
available that are often expensive because of

750
00:37:46,529 --> 00:37:49,920
a  ask if you have a relatively small

751
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,650
no market and the production of a

752
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:57,430
specialized device is expensive so

753
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:00,690
are products in which

754
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,819
that is total taxes are often expensive but

755
00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:05,109
actually it is maybe just a

756
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:07,650
button pressed

757
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,979
and the health sector ready the

758
00:38:10,979 --> 00:38:12,759
oldest the bills just might

759
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:14,920
cost little  to the traffic jam or something

760
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,349
it just doesn't make any sense

761
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:19,539
but that's how you find what you're finding on

762
00:38:19,539 --> 00:38:21,880
the market right now and

763
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,660
answering the question

764
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,380
polytec or kugel innovation

765
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:30,459
is outside of the normative is

766
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:33,759
to think of the established routines to take a

767
00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:36,029
product

768
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:41,160
and price or a

769
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,540
user and go back and forth from there

770
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,690
to fin a way  how you can reduce the whole

771
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,380


772
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,630
thing or produce it more cheaply in a maker that happens

773
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,630
every day and works with the things

774
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:57,120
that you don't exactly exist so

775
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,570
look at what will be very expensive

776
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,340
first of all we do something that is very very

777
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,410
cheap so that both of them are destroyed that's okay

778
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,110
that you  sometimes used a new one and

779
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:10,730
then from this mainz could that

780
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:14,310
carries and also to the

781
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,520
healthcare sector and this use is i think what

782
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,060
people would have google talk or

783
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,460
regale innovation

784
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,690
yes the short answer would probably be

785
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:28,800
that the cheap cheap production is

786
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,970
the easiest thing i

787
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:36,420
can find  to solve are exciting

788
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,210
answer thank you very

789
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,440
much for the great explanation

790
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,320
the next question is

791
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,320
how

792
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,770
how can politics how can this

793
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:53,580
movement include people

794
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,870
who are not so interested in politics right now

795
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,310
but just

796
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,450
want to build is cool of

797
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:03,710
course because the political

798
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:07,500
scene  is who loves it or hates

799
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,100
excited and i want jet  currently politics

800
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,410
pretty much doesn't matter

801
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,410
so

802
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,330
level or with mixed for the

803
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,330
screen

804
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,920
for

805
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,540
that's why i also focus

806
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,460
on doing things that are liked

807
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,170
with physical things the

808
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:34,370
easier to talk about because it

809
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:37,920
crystallizes the thoughts matt shaving you

810
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,150
write bad things on

811
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:44,340
a card  or karl bender it's

812
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,270
physical things

813
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,750
and you already have a prototype of the

814
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,309
prototype helps

815
00:40:53,309 --> 00:40:55,789
to

816
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,710
structure your thoughts and to communicate in solutions that's

817
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,349
why for me it's that

818
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:03,119
the thoughts are becoming more and more solution-oriented

819
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,000


820
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,339
old town festival or

821
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,890
manufacturing principles or design

822
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:12,619
principles

823
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:17,809
for me always but i

824
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,130
like  something physical is to have something

825
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:23,339
tangible that the solution

826
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:25,069
is to make it tangible

827
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:28,730
and in addition there are always the

828
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,799
different the different areas

829
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:34,849
of politics

830
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,740
but you want to make your

831
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,750
own

832
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,279
neighborhood or or Sunday in the green valleys and have

833
00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:47,309
air quality sensors look at

834
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:51,289
you or  that 

835
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:54,630
offering a wifi network all of these things

836
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,890
are very political in a way

837
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,380
but also honestly not

838
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,420
political how you put it

839
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:06,859
i think there will be many

840
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:10,049
areas where everyone can get involved

841
00:42:10,049 --> 00:42:13,529
everyone can get involved the grandmother or a

842
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:14,750
whole school class in

843
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,950
the end it's not  so relevant

844
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,660
ok

845
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:25,009
very interesting answer i

846
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:27,000
think the time for questions and answers

847
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,069
is going by fast so thank you

848
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:30,900
