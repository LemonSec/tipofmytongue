2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,800
welcome to the channel gahakdis from

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,400
hell we're streaming from the beer

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,120
shonen at aldehole in brandenburg

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,119
the coming talk looks at the method of

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,520
carbon thinking a way to limit climate

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,560
change

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,560
hans peter schmidt will tell us how to

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,279
do this with the help of biochar we're

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,599
really happy to have him as a speaker

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,519
because hans peter is a pioneer in the

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,519
field of biochar science

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,520
and he has worked on the development of

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,719
its technologies and the application

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,719
following the talk we have a short q and

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,200
a session from your devices at home you

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,840
can send your questions via twitter to

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,559
the hashtag

19
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:49,200
rc3hell or via the irc

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,160
chat or the rocketchat at

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,559
rcrc 3 minus gahactus from hell later

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,480
you can also meet hans peter

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,239
in a jitsi room

24
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,720
called discussion dot

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,840
either minus hello dot d e

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,439
and now over to hans peter

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,640
for 15 years now that i work

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,280
on methods to extract carbon dioxide

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,960
from the atmosphere

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,360
and to sequester the

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,200
extracted carbon

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,159
in a stable form

33
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,759
other than soil or in sediments

34
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,000
and

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,680
we found and many others who work on the

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,400
same subject found

37
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,040
several methods

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,000
that can extract significant amounts

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,880
of

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,640
carbon dioxide

41
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,920
and

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,119
also methods that can transform

43
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,479
on the extracted carbon dioxide into

44
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,759
stable carbon forms that do not

45
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,680
degrade biologically or chemically

46
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,960
and

47
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,520
the itaka institute for which i work

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,038
also developed

49
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,000
the first carbon sink certificate

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
that can certify

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,040
and

52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,480
assess

53
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,360
the amounts of carbon that are stored in

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,760
carbon sinks

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,959
and

56
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,319
now at

57
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,040
the end of 21

58
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,840
we we are the stage that

59
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,920
several of these technologies could be

60
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,760
scaled

61
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,080
and have to be scaled

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,680
to reach the objectives

63
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,959
of the climate policy

64
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,319
but this

65
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,120
scale up of these technologies is so

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,319
massive

67
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,280
that it will have an influence on

68
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,239
the

69
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,680
geophysics

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,239
of our planet

71
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,920
and that we have to consider

72
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,200
those risks we have to think them

73
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,959
now

74
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,200
without

75
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,080
further waiting

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,840
to

77
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,239
scale climate technologies

78
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,920
but

79
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
we need to take care

80
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,720
that

81
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,720
um this scale up is done sustainably

82
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,400
and

83
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,239
and in our talk uh i i want to

84
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,640
to make some of these points

85
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,200
that um we will not

86
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,760
hopefully save the climate

87
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,879
to get

88
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,280
extinguished by other means

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,640
and the end

90
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,360
so the

91
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,000
the the situation is rather clear

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,200
and

93
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,120
most in the world

94
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,040
most governments

95
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,519
and people understood it by now that we

96
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,720
need to reduce the emissions

97
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,319
to

98
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,319
close to zero by 2050

99
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,840
and and in all scenarios we should have

100
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,480
reached already

101
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,599
the

102
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,759
point of highest emissions

103
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,040
by now

104
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,440
but in fact emissions still rise but

105
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,960
um

106
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,159
everybody counts on

107
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,919
on emission reductions

108
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,840
to happen uh rather soon

109
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,440
so we

110
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,000
to be honest we cannot see these

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,440
reductions

112
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,290
happening

113
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,960
[Music]

114
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,040
in the close future

115
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,199
but

116
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,400
let's let's assume

117
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,280
emissions will be reduced

118
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,840
then

119
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
according to the plan

120
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,440
until 2050

121
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,400
even then we will need massive carbon

122
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,440
sinks because of the effect of the co2

123
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,520
that was already emitted to the

124
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,160
atmosphere and that is not degraded

125
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,800
but has a global warming effect that

126
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,919
continues for several

127
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,759
hundreds and thousands and ten thousands

128
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,960
of years

129
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,800
so

130
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,039
to clean up

131
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,880
legacy emissions

132
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,280
we need

133
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,720
to extract

134
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,280
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

135
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,880
and need to establish carbon sinks

136
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,840
and

137
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,759
we know that

138
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,360
if everything goes according to

139
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,360
the plans of the paris

140
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,800
treaty

141
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,639
and

142
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,919
and and other um decision makers

143
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,120
then

144
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,600
we need

145
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,520
to extract 800 billion tons of co2 from

146
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,520
the atmosphere by the year 2100

147
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,080
so this is not to balance further

148
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,720
emissions this is only to balance

149
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,120
the effect of the emissions already

150
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,960
occurred

151
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,319
but the technologies that are available

152
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,440
um

153
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,280
to extract carbon dioxide they are

154
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,840
called negative emission technologies

155
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,960
it's negative because it's positive is

156
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,840
when you emit to somewhere negative

157
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,479
would be just this abstraction

158
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,120
not a nice name but that's what it is

159
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,759
so net technologies um are nature based

160
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,160
like afforestation

161
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,440
and the growth of biomass which in fact

162
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,560
is the way to extract naturally carbon

163
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,800
dioxide from the atmosphere

164
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,160
and as long as this biomass is growing

165
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,240
and does not decompose

166
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,840
um the carbon is stored

167
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,560
however when you transform the

168
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,599
uh

169
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,599
biomass carbon by pyrolysis

170
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,000
into a stable form like biochar and

171
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,840
paralytic oils

172
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,960
this

173
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,520
transformed carbon can be stored for

174
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,880
longer times

175
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,800
and that's what is here in the middle

176
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,639
the biochar or

177
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,400
paragonic carbon caption storage method

178
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,160
which is partly nature based and partly

179
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,599
um persistent and measurable because you

180
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,759
have long-term carbon thing that cannot

181
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,560
just go away by accident like in the

182
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,319
forest fire

183
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,319
there are other means like enhanced

184
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,759
weathering

185
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,479
we take volcanic

186
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,080
stone powders

187
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,720
um that can react to

188
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,479
carbonates

189
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,160
and then there is direct air capture is

190
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,520
when when you

191
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,199
extract

192
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,240
by

193
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680
adsorption

194
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,520
on the co2 so you filter air and you

195
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,599
extract the co2

196
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,479
and transform it then into something

197
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,080
that you can store

198
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,639
so our speciality is

199
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,520
pix

200
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,720
the biochar method and

201
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,440
just shortly to show you

202
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,919
how this works

203
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,360
so you have biomass

204
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,240
you heat the biomass in the absence of

205
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,120
air up to

206
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,640
400 to 800 degrees

207
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,839
and then

208
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,560
it's like cooking without air this

209
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,920
biomass

210
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,399
and then you have a solid residue which

211
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,600
is the biochar liquid residue that you

212
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,560
can

213
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,360
condense from the gas phase which is the

214
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,880
paralytic oil

215
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,600
and you still have a permanent gas

216
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,000
which usually is

217
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,080
um combusted

218
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,720
to drive the whole process

219
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,880
which is um

220
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,800
energy neutral so you do not need

221
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,399
external energy to run this process

222
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,920
and

223
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,760
then this biochar

224
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,120
can be used for example in agriculture

225
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,040
to increase yields

226
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,320
um and to improve soil quality

227
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,120
um and then this makes that you have can

228
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,959
grow more biomass that then again can go

229
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:33,839
back

230
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,600
to

231
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,240
to the production of

232
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,560
biomass and then transforming by

233
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,839
pyrolysis

234
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,240
biochar can also be used

235
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,080
in industrial products

236
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,200
and in building materials in plastics

237
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,600
and

238
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,160
and composite materials

239
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,399
where the carbon does not decompose

240
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,920
neither

241
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,040
so

242
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,000
so this is in very short what is pigs

243
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,279
pyrogenic carbon capture and storage

244
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,399
um

245
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,880
this is a pyrolysis unit of of a

246
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,360
smaller size um that can produce

247
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,800
up to something like 1500 tons of

248
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,079
biochar per year

249
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,640
now shortly again how it looks

250
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,360
inside pyrolysis so biomass that is

251
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,720
shredded to smaller particles

252
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,000
goes into the screwdriver and

253
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,450
um

254
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,519
[Music]

255
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,320
so

256
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,880
it's avoided that any air can enter this

257
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,560
process and then it goes into this screw

258
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,000
reactor

259
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,560
and the biomass is

260
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,640
transported here

261
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,959
in this reactor where it is heated from

262
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,519
environment temperature of 20 degrees up

263
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,839
to 600 degrees

264
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:56,800
and

265
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,200
then the biochar

266
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,160
is the solid residue of this cooking

267
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,040
that flows out of the process

268
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,920
while

269
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,360
the other uh 50 of the carbon is in the

270
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,800
gas phase

271
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,839
um

272
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,399
which is separated here and then

273
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,920
in this case all the gases are burnt to

274
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,959
produce thermic energy that drives the

275
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,000
process

276
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,640
and is then be used

277
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,880
for heating purposes

278
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,680
however if you do not burn

279
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,240
the gases you can also condense the

280
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,320
gases and use the

281
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,360
liquid

282
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,640
um

283
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,560
of of the process

284
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,440
the biochar is looks

285
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,120
like this

286
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,560
it's a very porous material

287
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,640
that conserves

288
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,880
the biological structure here you have a

289
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,880
piece of wood that is carbonized it

290
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,519
looks like charcoal

291
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,760
and if you look on the microscope you

292
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,360
see this enormous porous structure

293
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,440
which explains a lot of

294
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,519
functions and effects that we see in

295
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,040
biochar

296
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
for example you can

297
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,399
impregnate it

298
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,440
with organic fertilizers

299
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,600
and then all these pores are filled with

300
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,360
organic fertilizers

301
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,560
is preserved so it cannot be leached out

302
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,160
to the soil and plants and microbes can

303
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,120
feed

304
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,079
from

305
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,079
these conserved organic

306
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,880
fertilizers

307
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,959
so we have an effect

308
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,639
of this biochar on economic systems but

309
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,880
what i want to talk about today is only

310
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,279
the effect that if you put this biochar

311
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,639
to soil

312
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,079
this carbon

313
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,839
which was

314
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,839
co2 in the atmosphere which was

315
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,839
assimilated by the biomass which was

316
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,399
transformed

317
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,120
um in the pyrolysis

318
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,320
to aromatic carbon which is this black

319
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,920
stuff this aromatic carbon cannot be

320
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,279
degraded

321
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,959
uh over centuries by microorganisms so

322
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,839
if you put it to soil it is a long-term

323
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,639
carbon sink

324
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,279
so

325
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,880
to have

326
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
a global effect

327
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,600
um we need a lot of biomass

328
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,639
in the european context

329
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,920
we could say

330
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,360
we use

331
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,560
residual

332
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,040
biomass leftovers from

333
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,639
food processing

334
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,880
or harvest residues

335
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,079
or

336
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,680
manure

337
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,320
or serious sludge so these are all

338
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,560
biomass that could be

339
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,519
transformed by pyrolysis however

340
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,600
the amount

341
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,920
of this residue carbon

342
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,360
is not

343
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,639
um

344
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,760
as much

345
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
as it could have

346
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,959
a climate effect we need a lot more

347
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,000
biomass and it means we have to grow

348
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,440
biomass

349
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,040
especially

350
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,480
for

351
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,639
the extraction of carbon dioxide from

352
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,639
the atmosphere and the transformation by

353
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,560
pyrolysis

354
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,600
so we have to combine

355
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,320
carbon farming systems with

356
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,880
pigs with pyrogenic carbon capture and

357
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,000
storage

358
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,639
and there are different methods that are

359
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,600
not

360
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,240
just monocultures

361
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,320
highly intensive

362
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,680
production

363
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,399
but

364
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,800
these are what we call carbon farming

365
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,079
systems

366
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,959
um

367
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,279
like you can see here these are silver

368
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,839
arable so you combine wood

369
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,680
and drops

370
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,130
with arable with crops

371
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,560
[Music]

372
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,680
or you have

373
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,399
this kind of acroforestry systems

374
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,560
that are highly productive in regard to

375
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,399
biomass

376
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,880
instead of having just pastries you can

377
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
have silver pastures

378
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,639
so animals range

379
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,079
below trees that produce uh

380
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,959
additional biomass

381
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,720
we would also need

382
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,959
uh algae farms that are highly

383
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,480
productive

384
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,360
and could be combined to shellfish

385
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,240
and argus would

386
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,760
[Music]

387
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,000
also clean uh coastal water from uh

388
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,040
exceeding

389
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,160
nutrients

390
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,600
and so we can see that if we investigate

391
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,180
uh different farming systems um

392
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,360
[Music]

393
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,480
that in addition to food production

394
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,880
because we do not want to replace food

395
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,600
production by biomass production but in

396
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,959
addition to the food production which is

397
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,959
the green bar

398
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,800
in a tropical

399
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,720
agroforestry system

400
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,279
we can produce the same amount of food

401
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,720
as now but in addition

402
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,279
we can produce biomass for carbon

403
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,440
sequestration

404
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,839
in systems like tropical forest garden

405
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,480
you can have both and you can intensify

406
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,399
the systems

407
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,639
um however the uh suggested eucalyptus

408
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,680
monoculture as you can see here is would

409
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,959
only be for carbon capture and would not

410
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,839
produce food and as you can see is not

411
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,639
very efficient anyway

412
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,800
it just doesn't make much work

413
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,279
and also marine seaweed is quite

414
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,519
efficient in this regard

415
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,639
now

416
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,160
um

417
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,199
if you come back if we want now this

418
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,120
part this green part this is the carbon

419
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,839
sync part that we need to balance global

420
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,680
temperatures

421
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,920
and we know we need

422
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,880
270 billion tons of carbon in this

423
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,240
carbon zinc

424
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,480
so this is 800 gigaton co2 equivalent

425
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,799
and what does it mean if you would with

426
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,959
this method pyrogenic carbon capture

427
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,119
storage delivers 30

428
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,919
of the necessary carbon sink

429
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,000
what does it mean for global resources

430
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,959
so

431
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,079
for this to happen for this 30

432
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,039
of the minimum necessary carbon thing we

433
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,079
would need

434
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,919
about 100

435
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,799
billion tons of biochar 100 gigatons of

436
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,840
biochar until 2100

437
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,960
just to get an imagination on how much

438
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,280
this is

439
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,080
this is the amount of one thousand five

440
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,200
hundred

441
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,840
of this matterhorn uh

442
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,720
mountains so the volume

443
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,160
of

444
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,799
one matahorn that you find in the swiss

445
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,760
alps

446
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,120
multiplied by 1500

447
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,960
with dense

448
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,320
biochar so just the imagination of how

449
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,880
much we need to extract and sink and

450
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,840
that's only thirty percent

451
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,559
and this amount corresponds

452
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,559
to a thin layer

453
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,080
of two centimeter of biochar so two

454
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,160
centimeter of biochar

455
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,280
on each hectare of global agricultural

456
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,799
land

457
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,559
so we would have to cover

458
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
all agricultural lands by two

459
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,520
centimeters of biochar which then will

460
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,960
be

461
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,080
or plowed into the soil as a carbon sink

462
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,600
so this is massive massive massive

463
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,840
and it only makes 30 percent

464
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,679
of the biochar

465
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,919
so we would need to

466
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,679
produce this amount of biochar we would

467
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,160
need 190 gigatons of biomass

468
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,200
and

469
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,880
so this

470
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,480
hannet

471
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480
giga ton of biomass

472
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,000
um

473
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,480
[Music]

474
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,120
we need to compare to the global

475
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,360
standing biomass

476
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,799
and that's about

477
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,919
0.8 percent of the global standing

478
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,440
biomass

479
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,120
and 0.8 of the global standing biomass

480
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,600
would have to be paralyzed

481
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,960
every year

482
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,039
from the year 2050 to 2100

483
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,720
to produce

484
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,039
the amount of carbon zinc

485
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,640
that's necessary

486
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,039
to preserve 30 percent of the climate

487
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,400
and that

488
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,919
would need about

489
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,760
380 000 industrial pyrolysis plants

490
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,880
so

491
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,440
we calculated and looked and

492
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,520
what does it mean to

493
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,480
produce 400 000 um

494
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,520
pyrolysis industrial pyrolysis plants

495
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,000
and we imagine that it could be

496
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,240
has to be produced in chain

497
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,280
production like cars

498
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,520
but to reach

499
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,240
uh the um

500
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,320
negative emission potential that's

501
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,320
necessary by 2050 we need an exponential

502
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,520
growth

503
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,039
of the production

504
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,760
of these pyrolysis units which would be

505
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,960
possible and you see you see here

506
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,360
this is the blue line

507
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,360
so we have this exponential growth

508
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,120
and

509
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,400
and as you can see

510
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,600
we have then a slowdown

511
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,159
of of the

512
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,520
growth of absolute numbers so the the

513
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,320
orange line here you see the production

514
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,799
numbers per year so you you have to go

515
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,120
until 2043 to produce 50 000 units per

516
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,080
year

517
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,919
but then you have to

518
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,600
to slow down

519
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
the production because we can only use

520
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,520
400 000

521
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,000
paralysis units on earth

522
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,640
after that we do not have

523
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
more biomass to treat

524
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,200
so we need an exponential growth because

525
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,280
of the severity of the pro of the

526
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,080
problem and then we need an exponential

527
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,520
degrowth

528
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,200
um after 2043

529
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,159
um to a steady state

530
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,679
of the production of few plants

531
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,840
that are needed to renew

532
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,440
the standing plans

533
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,600
so this is very interesting from an

534
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,679
economic point of view and we will see

535
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,960
this in several areas

536
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,280
because of the global economy and the

537
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,440
global problems and the uh global

538
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,000
limits of resources that we need um

539
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,400
exponential growth and degrows for

540
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,520
several technologies and how that will

541
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,360
be done that's that's very interesting

542
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,000
which subject of today

543
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,960
um

544
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,440
so so you saw it's massive what would be

545
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,640
needed

546
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,520
um 400 000 plants

547
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,880
um

548
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,440
and one plants cost about 1.3 million

549
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,039
euro so that's

550
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,000
about 500 billion euro

551
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,039
and that

552
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,760
is not so much in the end it's less than

553
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,320
50 percent of the annual military

554
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,440
spending

555
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,679
so from an economic point of view it

556
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,760
would certainly be possible

557
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,840
to make it happen

558
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,159
so more problematic is

559
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,159
how can we

560
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,480
make it happen on an economic point of

561
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,480
view

562
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,080
financially this is very attractive as

563
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,400
we can see first the production of the

564
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,480
industrial units and then you have a

565
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,799
global carbon sink market

566
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,919
um if you calculate 100 euro per ton of

567
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,799
co2 equivalent and we know how much

568
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,280
co2 we need to extract

569
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,799
so this is a 400 billion euro market per

570
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,640
year only for carbon sink credits

571
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,840
so

572
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,080
massive and very interested market and

573
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
that's why you see a lot of financial

574
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,480
institutes going already now into these

575
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,520
markets

576
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,919
well what do we have with the risks and

577
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,480
side effects so

578
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,640
um

579
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,480
the zero 0.8

580
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,720
of the global plant mass that has to be

581
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,880
paralyzed every year

582
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,159
that's about um

583
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,440
0.75 ton biomass per hectare of

584
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,600
agriculture land so if we extract from

585
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,200
every hectare

586
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,360
of the world's uh

587
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,200
crop land

588
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,720
um

589
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,279
a bit less than one tonne of biomass we

590
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,440
could solve the problem so that does not

591
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,039
seem too much

592
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,039
however this biomass is everywhere and

593
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,520
there are there are millions of farmers

594
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,360
that all would have to be convinced to

595
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,080
do it and then we have to bring the

596
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,360
industry

597
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,279
close to them so that they can extract

598
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,039
the biomass

599
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,480
so let's say if 10 of agricultural land

600
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,559
was used for biomass production by

601
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,880
carbon farming

602
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,919
uh so we set aside 10 of the global

603
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,559
agricultural land and then we only need

604
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,279
7.5 tons of biomass

605
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,840
per hectare

606
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,159
and that would be feasible because

607
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,360
thanks to biochar based fertilization

608
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,919
crop productivity

609
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,240
can increase

610
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,480
about more than 20 percent

611
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,960
so to have 10 percent aside would be

612
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,520
possible so let's say

613
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,010
um

614
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,279
[Music]

615
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,120
it would

616
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,360
in theory be possible to produce the

617
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,640
biomass necessary for the carbon sinks

618
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,919
on the available agricultural land

619
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,000
without

620
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,679
decreasing food

621
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,080
production

622
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,840
but in the last five minutes

623
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,080
of my talk i want to give you another

624
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,200
outlook

625
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,640
um because socially environmentally

626
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,760
it's still very much on the edge

627
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,360
to do this huge scaling carbon by

628
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,479
organic carbon

629
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,880
storage

630
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,559
project

631
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,720
because we have several other problems

632
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,120
on earth not only the climate problem we

633
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,919
have the biodiversity crisis

634
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,840
uh other ecosystem crisis and therefore

635
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,520
um the half earth project was

636
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,918
lanced

637
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,039
about five years ago

638
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,760
to say that

639
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,919
it is needed that 50

640
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,440
of the earth's surface is preserved

641
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,039
for nature recovery

642
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
and there are in fact

643
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,760
quite a lot of governments that

644
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,919
agreed to this program

645
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,850
astonishingly

646
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,039
[Music]

647
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,919
and it has a lot of

648
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,520
support

649
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,520
this initiative from audrey wilson

650
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,440
you find more information on half earth

651
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,880
project

652
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,440
on the website that you see here below

653
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,080
because that's that's the the point if

654
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,400
we do all this climate action we do not

655
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,200
have enough land to preserve it for

656
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,039
natural revival

657
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,600
um however we have technology that's

658
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,960
possible

659
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,080
and

660
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,960
in the latest saudi arabian

661
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,679
solar energy project

662
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,840
the kilowatt hour was produced at 0.88

663
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,240
cents and that means energy becomes so

664
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,200
cheap

665
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,760
then we have new

666
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,360
possibilities for technology

667
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,879
to produce in fact

668
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,120
carbon sinks

669
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
without plants

670
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,080
so

671
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,039
the

672
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,640
operest company

673
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,080
um they created this project a fuel

674
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,960
which is a methanol factory that runs

675
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,919
entirely on renewable

676
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,279
powered energy so you have these large

677
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,720
solar panels

678
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,799
and then you have uh

679
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,120
here the

680
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,159
um

681
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,720
the chemistry that's behind

682
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,000
so

683
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,360
in short

684
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,840
you have direct air capture here where

685
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,159
you filter out the co2 from the

686
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,520
atmosphere

687
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,880
um the energy is used for electrolysis

688
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,399
um

689
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,679
that is done with desalinated water so

690
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,360
they produce hydrogen from desalinated

691
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,199
water with the solar energy

692
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,200
and with the co2 from direct air capture

693
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,000
that is methanol synthesized

694
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,159
and methanol

695
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,640
is a liquid form of carbon it's a bit

696
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,919
like alcohol but just methanol

697
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:14,880
and

698
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,559
which is not toxic

699
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,480
which can be pumped which can be

700
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,960
transported which can be used as a fuel

701
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,440
and which could also be used as a carbon

702
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,720
sink

703
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,600
so

704
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,760
you you can find here and when you have

705
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,039
more time you can go into details um so

706
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,559
we calculated

707
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,120
um the the total balance so for 500 000

708
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,240
tons

709
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,039
of carbon dioxide equivalent in the

710
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,679
carbon sink so that means we extract 500

711
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,720
000 tons of co2 from the atmosphere

712
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,960
we need 11.5

713
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,039
square kilometers of

714
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,640
solar panels

715
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,880
that produce uh

716
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,480
6000 gigawatts hour of energy part of

717
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,799
this energy is used for the direct air

718
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,679
capture part of this energy is used for

719
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,240
desalination and electrolysis which

720
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,440
produces

721
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,559
oxygen

722
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,679
and then the hydrogen and the co2

723
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,480
are synthesized to methanol

724
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,720
where you produce some energy that goes

725
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,320
back to the process

726
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,480
where you produce also water that also

727
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,399
goes back to the process and then you

728
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,320
have the carbon zinc and this methanol

729
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,520
in fact

730
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,720
um can be pumped back into old fossil

731
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,320
storages like in the saudi arabian

732
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
desert

733
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,600
and so we scale this up

734
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,918
and

735
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,919
we would need

736
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,159
only 21

737
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,080
of the surface of saudi arabia

738
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,200
used for this methanol carbon sink

739
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,559
technology

740
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,080
to sequester the necessary 800 gigaton

741
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,240
of co2 equivalent

742
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,600
and pump it

743
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,440
back into abundant fossil oil fields

744
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,159
until 2100

745
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,440
and the interesting thing is that only

746
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,840
this is only 10 percent of the surface

747
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,679
that would be needed

748
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,840
if we do the same thing

749
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,360
with plants

750
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,320
and biomass and where everything works

751
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,760
perfectly

752
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,760
optimized

753
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,840
without chemical fertilizer without

754
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,520
irrigation and not counting the risk of

755
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,600
fire and other disasters happening to

756
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,760
the biomass production

757
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,279
with this technological solution

758
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,840
i think we could prepare

759
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,440
the biggest

760
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,279
the biggest

761
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,600
hack ever

762
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
to turn

763
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,880
the arabian fossil fuel producers

764
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,720
into carbon sink producers and pump back

765
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,360
the liquefied carbon extracted from the

766
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,039
atmosphere

767
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,880
to the fossil oil fields

768
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,360
thank you very much

769
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,519
so

770
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,200
how can we avoid the risk of deployment

771
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,960
of co2 things becoming a cheap excuse

772
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,519
for not pursuing the necessary reduction

773
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,000
of co2 emissions

774
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,640
on the other hand

775
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,279
yeah this is this is the main

776
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,240
the main

777
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,600
problem i think

778
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,080
now when we enter this carbon sink

779
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,279
markets

780
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,440
because uh all the carbon things that

781
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,799
are bought now

782
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,240
are used for emission compensation

783
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,519
and um

784
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,919
but but we have no choice we have to

785
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,880
curb the emissions so

786
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,919
normally policy

787
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,799
makers should

788
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,080
defend the compensation of emissions

789
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,080
with carbon sinks because the carbon

790
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,120
things we need for the compensation of

791
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,840
legacy emissions of all this co2 that

792
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,519
was already emitted

793
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,159
before now

794
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,399
yes

795
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:25,600
so

796
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,840
how do you estimate the potential of

797
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,919
pigs against the background of

798
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,880
increasing interest in biomass for food

799
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,559
energy and chemical industry

800
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,039
yeah we we need all of it and we will

801
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,320
not have enough of it and that's why i

802
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,760
presented the possibility to

803
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,679
extract carbon dioxide from the

804
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,519
atmosphere for

805
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,000
the chemical industry for fuel for

806
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,640
materials for plastics and also for

807
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,480
carbon sinks

808
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,240
i think we

809
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,960
will not achieve uh

810
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,440
the protection of our ecosystems and of

811
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,760
the climate

812
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,600
with the biomass that we have on the

813
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,320
planet only

814
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,080
all right

815
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,919
actually just the fourth question came

816
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,360
in i'm

817
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,960
i think we have time for one more little

818
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,519
question how can we be sure that

819
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,399
operas would be more successful than in

820
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,158
example this attack

821
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,320
what was the first one

822
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,640
how can we be sure that

823
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,720
operation would be more successful than

824
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,279
this attack

825
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,960
yeah i

826
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,039
the economics are much better now

827
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,159
because uh solar energy is so much

828
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,320
cheaper than 20 years ago when desert

829
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,880
tech started

830
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,240
and

831
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,480
the the system is more complex because

832
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,720
of the coupling with chemical industry

833
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,200
with carbon sink and the necessity

834
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,080
is also higher so i

835
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,559
i think

836
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,519
we

837
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,320
we can achieve this and this attack is

838
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,600
not dead yet

839
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,560
um

840
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,359
and and could continue also towards uh

841
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,440
more complex systems

842
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,800
all right thank you

843
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,239
well anz peter thank you very much um

844
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,320
i'm saying goodbye to you in the stream

845
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,960
now but everyone is invited to join

846
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,359
further discussion in the jitsi room now

847
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,719
which you can reach under

848
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,239
