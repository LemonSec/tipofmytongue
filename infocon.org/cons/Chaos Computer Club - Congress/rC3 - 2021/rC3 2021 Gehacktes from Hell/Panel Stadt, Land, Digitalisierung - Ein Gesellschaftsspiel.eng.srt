00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,290
hacked from hell or hacked

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,240
from hell

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,300
we are now here for our panel

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,320
stadland digitization a

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,240
social game but before we

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,710
start with that a little bit of

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,620
information and that this is

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,240
not just a pure situation where

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,680
you can listen because you can

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,140
ask yourselves your questions and get rid of them

13
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,390
there are various channels on the

14
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,719
one hand you can go into the rc as you

15
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:40,210
go or also the rocket there is

16
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,339
one channel each called hashtag rc3

17
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:44,769
hacked from hell there you can

18
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:47,260
ask your questions twitter could

19
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,699
just use the hashtag rc3 and

20
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:53,679
if you have any questions here

21
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,899
to our panel members or to the

22
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:57,850
whole group they could just ask there they

23
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,679
will magically end up here

24
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,789
in a pet

25
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,870
and then i will try them

26
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,530
to install

27
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,360
and

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,620
yes otherwise if you somehow

29
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,600
wanted to tweet about this channel

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,640

we are now we come to the start of our

34
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,770
panel

35
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,720
as already mentioned stadland

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,990

00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,070
the projects here, namely to the old

00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,420
hell of which this channel is also here,

42
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,610
but today would be purely through the

43
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,520
moderation and

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,070
ask interested questions and I am

45
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,080
very happy to be able to welcome here on the

46
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,890
one hand frerick from the choir on marco the

47
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,630
mayor of the nice  communities we find

48
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,450
each other here namely wiesenburg here

49
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,970
specifically we are in wiesenburg mark then

50
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,060
martin my roommate and colleague from

51
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,810
the old hall and janosch from the smart

52
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,130
village and

53
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,140
coconut

54
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,240
exactly that means we have

55
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,830
represented the political side here on the one hand

56
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,350
but also

57
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,350
three times

58
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,340
comrades-in-arms from projects and  we are

59
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,600
now starting with a small

60
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,090
round of introductions

61
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,250
where simply j  now you

62
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,440
should have a say yourself and we start here with

63
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,220
marco and he also brought us 12 slides

64
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,560
so now just press the right

65
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,890
button and I'll hand it over to

66
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,050
you

67
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,410
thank you so much carina

68
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,840
I'm glad I can be here old shell new people

69
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,050
it's become your motto that i'm

70
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,570
happy to adopt for other

71
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,600
events that's also about

72
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,940
our community as a whole so the

73
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,290
community of wiesenburg/mark is a

74
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,560
large community with

75
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,740
220 square kilometers about

76
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,220
a quarter of berlin but only

77
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,710
4200 inhabitants we have lost a third of the

78
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,230
inhabitants since  the reunification and

79
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,470
accordingly also with the demographics

80
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,420
our problems and of course we

81
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,980
also try to get the curve.

82
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,790
today i am the political deed here

83
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,620
since 2005 ten mayors of

84
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,990
the community have been allowed

85
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,040
and for us it is important that we

86
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,390
try to do this like the young families

87
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,790
in particular

88
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,890
and  that we are currently

89
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,750
keeping the parents stable the political system looks like this

90
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,200
from the fact that the money the funds you get from

91
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,750
the state you get them according to the number of

92
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,060
inhabitants i.e. the region that is

93
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,800
shrinking we now have in

94
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,690
brandenburg the discussion about

95
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,709
lusatia they will have less money every year due to the

96
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,020
loss of inhabitants and

97
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,630
a structural change to counteract the one

98
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,800
has less money available every year

99
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,870
nothing good can

100
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,320
come of it and as long as that is the case

101
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,850
we will have great difficulties in brandenburg

102
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,890
i am pleased

103
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,100
that a group had been found here everyone

104
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,290
who developed this location

105
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,520
needs more than a few

106
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,760
people and we're already on the subject of

107
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,030
country and rural being

108
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,330
here i thought so in the round since we are

109
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,650
all kinda a bit

110
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,780
from the city i think so

111
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,490
i'm originally from

112
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,740
prignitz that's in brandenburg and then i'm in

113
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,660
potsdam studied regional sciences

114
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,890
with a focus on small stands and

115
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,210
communities singing along population

116
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,340
different  uldung yes, so that was a good

117
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,070
fit wiesenburg/mark

118
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,260
but that's what matters to the people who

119
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,860
are still here now, in particular,

120
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,420
yes, it's about the fact that they also

121
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,030
want to be appreciated, so after the

122
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,340
reunification many

123
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,330
production companies were closed here,

124
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,970
so I did  a photo ready for you

125
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,090
where you can see we have the brewery on the top left, on the

126
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,690
right is the social wing

127
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,040
, we as a community have

128
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,350
now acquired both buildings to

129
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,090
use them again and to bring a little

130
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,730
more self-esteem back to the

131
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,830
community, that is  extremely important

132
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,200
because people used to live

133
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,420
and work here today many only

134
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,820
live and work outside in the cities

135
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,440
so we have to get the jobs

136
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,490
back and it is important that

137
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,500
we try to do it in small

138
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,680
parts, so we have a

139
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,670
typical zero eight, for example  fifteen

140
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,670
industrial parks with us since i became

141
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,200
mayor fink there has not been a

142
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,750
request from heimbe  drove the settlement

143
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,760
booty because 5000 square meters and

144
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,100
he still had to build a

145
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,380
hall well the demand is rather small

146
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,540
we have so many smaller groups who

147
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,920
need a workshop or

148
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,350
they need two or three offices and that's

149
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,510
why we

150
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,950
also acquired the wire drawing shop as a

151
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,380
community that an old one  site

152
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,960
where almost 400 people used to work

153
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,540
in gdr times which was then processed

154
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,950
and we have offices there we have

155
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,750
hold so half of it

156
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,690
collapsed but

157
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,600
you all know it has bars from

158
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,450
the old factory site and that of

159
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,040
course also something  otherwise,

160
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,630
i think it is excellent, especially as a municipality, that

161
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,660
we use this type of

162
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,270
property, the amazon morbid charm

163
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,590
and also have something quite urban,

164
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,180
our urban, i mean that you

165
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,389
have a meeting place, yes, the idea has been

166
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,310
lost,

167
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,720
we think of the restaurants, for example, which is  in

168
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,000
every village there used to be, there are

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,340
actually only in big place b  out there

170
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,020
in wiesenburg or on the

171
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,500
viola estate and what we would like to have while we are watching

172
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,470


173
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,240
that small-scale companies

174
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,430
look again that we enable

175
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,250
people who can work from home

176
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,450
that they can also do that as

177
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,850
but the broadband expansion in this

178
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,250
community of

179
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,310
it's still to come, we'll start in

180
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,970
january and by the end of june we should

181
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,450
have covered about 80% then, including

182
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,600
the old shell, for example

183
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,970
, and i think that's what sets us apart and of

184
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,290
course we're still looking

185
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,330
for users for all the properties we

186
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,030
've bought, they have under  other

187
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,340
things there is also a photo of the old

188
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,169
sawmill there is the cow village that yes

189
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:48,180
patrick is arriving today he will say something about that

190
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,580
we have

191
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,680
the wire drawing shop on the right with the chimney and below

192
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,169
that the hall and down there we are

193
00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:58,440
already busy working there is it  red

194
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,479
villa

195
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,490
there comes to offices rows and although the

196
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,370
eu-subsidies place the leaders

197
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,460
maybe know the funds  en or others it

198
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,229
is extremely important that we also have this

199
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:12,660
position here in the village yes in

200
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,390
this arc with 1200 inhabitants but around

201
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,060
these songs

202
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,490
this songs office where over 20 million

203
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,800
euros of funding are

204
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,580
spent that the

205
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,350
short distances are here i think

206
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,270
decide  to get this curve

207
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,340
the short distances we also have an

208
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,470
administration that built a roast new

209
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,650
team from january we will start

210
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:39,020
there are four of us in the project team

211
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,219
to market the properties and

212
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,809
then focus on that we

213
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:44,520
want to advertise them to

214
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,600
cooperatives or social enterprises

215
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,320
they have priority and the best concept

216
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,590
wins, so we are curious to see if it

217
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,030
will turn out well for us and of

218
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,070
course we are happy about every inquiry and

219
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,760
we also have such a small is such

220
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,080
a small development strategy

221
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,150
illustrated turn team can show

222
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,540
the mind map he will come again

223
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,510
projects that are also up to date

224
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,670
and you can see them at the top  n already

225
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,860
integrated relatively small the

226
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,380
old shell the seminar house same

227
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,260
docked a mastermind park because

228
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,260
we have all the craftsmen there and

229
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,700
so on with whom you can also

230
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,540
network well and that's

231
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,790
the smart village smart city area

232
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,400
where janosch is also there  and coconut and

233
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,450
our chairman smart village united,

234
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,190
which we have together with bad belzig,

235
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,290
that is also important that we are not

236
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,430
only on the road as a municipality of wiesenburg/mark

237
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,130
, so that's

238
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,420
what I remember when I'm

239
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,700
on the road politically, I'm just the

240
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,170
mayor  von wiesenburg mark

241
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,430
we also saw in the picture you are in the boat is

242
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,330
the district town it

243
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,570
is a good atmosphere that there is a

244
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,630
region and lots of interesting

245
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,970
places that we then connect with each other

246
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,360
and that make the whole thing interesting for

247
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,280
those who move here but are

248
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,460
afraid because they  don't know anyone

249
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,410
if you will feel at home here and

250
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,090
maybe at the end only

251
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,920
dan  n you don't really have to

252
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,630
worry because life in the

253
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,850
country is actually so

254
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,160
nice because you ca

255
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,480
n't choose as many contacts as you can in the

256
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,270
city where the city I have my

257
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,650
friends my network and the country

258
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,900
is just that  so

259
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,400
you have to know each other somehow

260
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,260
because that the one who has the

261
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,320
tractor who then fetches the wood or the

262
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,080
one who has the sawmill you

263
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,900
should I no have to and that's

264
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,970
also quite pleasant because we've tended to do that

265
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,420
lately  Packing everything in rooms,

266
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,430
yes, also in digital apps and so

267
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,440
on and there are my friends there are

268
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,140
the acquaintances there are the people I

269
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,720
data and so on

270
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,550
and here you are slowed down again

271
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,230
to real life and

272
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,660
I definitely want that  will and i

273
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,010
look for city and regional

274
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,320
planners ok thank you very much now we have

275
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,330
seen the view and yes a few

276
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,340
projects have already appeared actually

277
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,530
all represented  and now we

278
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,720
come to the part, namely the

279
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,430
presentation of the projects that have already been

280
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,360
mentioned here and

281
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,150
starting there on my left is

282
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,440
frederick we were right the rating

283
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,660
slide so now in the full screen

284
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,959
and

285
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,390
perfect

286
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,640
many thanks right here we see  the

287
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,190
property of the first knockout village in

288
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,900
brandenburg here in

289
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,730
wiesenburg this quasi neighbor so we are

290
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,240
four kilometers away from you and with

291
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,010
this sound recording you can see

292
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,990
why we chose this

293
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,280
place it is on the one hand very

294
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,930
close to the train station  you really

295
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,220
only go over the parking lot once and you are

296
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,900
already on the q village property

297
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,490
and in the middle we have the old

298
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,320
sawmill that we are now converting

299
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,900
to our use next to us below us here in

300
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,420
the picture is country golf that’s why so

301
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,940
many forests and me  I think that shows

302
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,470
just very well and especially in

303
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,760
combination with what we

304
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,060
heard for marco why we decided for

305
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,350
wiesenburg ents  have divorced or why

306
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,960
we are campaigning for new

307
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,220
life and work in the

308
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,290
country in general because we have in the big cities

309
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,210
we had a multitude of problems

310
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,680
and mostly it

311
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,540
is only about the

312
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,920
housing problem that is of course a

313
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,050
very big guest very essential  but

314
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,490
there is also the

315
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,170
problem of a lack of design space, but

316
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,250
there is no longer an opportunity

317
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,620
in big cities if you have not inherited

318
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,260
it or celebrated with the big exit

319
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,580
because he is still

320
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,140
creatively active at migros, of

321
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,520
course, it is special in berlin  blatant because

322
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,470
the city has

323
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,510
attracted a lot of creative people over many

324
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,310
years with this beautiful saying poor but sexy, but in recent

325
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,020
years a large number of

326
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,460
them have spit out and sold them out because in the end

327
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,840
berlin is simply not

328
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,700
for

329
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,550
this type of design space and that

330
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,930
's really  the great thing here so

331
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,390
you just come out of the station and you

332
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,670
h  at halt creative spaces without end

333
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,040
one has political support here

334
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,180
that is anything but a

335
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:09,960
matter of course

336
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,250
and I think you experience that

337
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,750
here too no, so the doors are open

338
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,280
and one is really happy here

339
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,930
when people come who don’t just

340
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,810
babble  but also has to do

341
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,340
and i think that's really such a prejudice

342
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,710
that in cities there is quite often that there is

343
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,050
such a blanket hostility or

344
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,880
skepticism towards newcomers from

345
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,560
the big city, we

346
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,630
actually don't experience that at all, so we

347
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,190
're with the q village

348
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,330
we are represented in wiesenburg, we are also represented at other

349
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,190
locations and we have the

350
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,350
same experience, namely that if you

351
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,900
don't appear there with your i know

352
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,820
everything better habitus but are really

353
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,140
curious to approach the people

354
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,520
from whom you also want to learn, of course you also have to

355
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,050
do a lot  learning is

356
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,030
in many respects a different life and

357
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,620
proves that you really  what does it do

358
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,940
for the regions not only for

359
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,500
yourself then you are actually really

360
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,150
welcomed with open arms everywhere

361
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,540
and you get a lot of support and to

362
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,740
make it a bit more concrete

363
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,970
we are going to the next slide

364
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,320
i will briefly explain again what the

365
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,850
cow village is  cool for that consist of

366
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,350
a collection of many small

367
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,820
ecologically built wooden houses and

368
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,680
large community buildings for the

369
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,940
community buildings we

370
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,220
always try

371
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,240
to use industrial ruins, i.e. vacancies, so that we don’t

372
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,820
somehow rebuild everything the houses, the

373
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,930
small

374
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,660
ones, but actually new buildings and the idea  behind it is that

375
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,460
we are working together as a cooperative

376
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,010
so a total of 40 houses are being built here

377
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,410
and saving space in our own four walls

378
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,120
so the smallest house starts

379
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,040
at 30 square meters it goes over 60

380
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,900
square meters then even the

381
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,060
largest house is only 80 square meters

382
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,250
and has to survive  just what we put

383
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,260
in our own  four walls

384
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,460
we can then save ourselves but as a community of

385
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,260
course also in the form of a

386
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,850
community then so we can do it all the

387
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,260
more that means in this

388
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,490
community building in this old

389
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,260
sawmill a coworking space

390
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,790
will be created event areas will be created

391
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,470
a kitchen with a long table so

392
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,820
just like it is here

393
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,440
, as coconut has demonstrated

394
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,970
, a so-called third place

395
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,310
should be returned, then

396
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,470
per event can take place in the region

397
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,730
where people can simply

398
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,320
meet again and from which

399
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,790
hopefully new impulses will be

400
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,319
sent out somehow

401
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:06,309
and exactly  it is also a very important

402
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:07,600
brand and no one emphasizes again that

403
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,529
this is not just an

404
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:10,149
investor project but is supported by

405
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:12,850
a cooperative and we

406
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,100
can really say that

407
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,300
we have already

408
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,860
allocated all the plots here, although or all the houses have been

409
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,350
allocated where we still have a lot  fewer 

410
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,639
are far away than you so we

411
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,929
started with it two years ago

412
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:25,149
but aren't even building

413
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:26,709
anything yet nothing has

414
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:28,029
happened so far we've just

415
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:29,889


416
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:32,350
been busy with planning law for two years but in these two

417
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,439
years we were able to  community has

418
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:37,689
already gotten to know each other and

419
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:39,399
this time it really fills me with pride

420
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:42,279
and joy to see what kind of people

421
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:43,929
feel addressed by this idea

422
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:46,149
and I am absolutely sure that they have exactly the

423
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:47,819
same attitudes here

424
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:49,410


425
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,759
that it takes something like this to live

426
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,290
together

427
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,579
everything works really open-minded

428
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,740
nice people who are all really interested

429
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,470
in design and what to do

430
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,819
and yes i think in

431
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:01,959
combination with everything that is happening here

432
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:05,769
the region of the high

433
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:07,629
fläming here wiesenburg bad belzig

434
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:09,399
will really be one  of the most creative

435
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,899
regions in all of brandenburg i can say

436
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:12,399
ar in Germany and it's really

437
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,809
nice to be able to be there

438
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:19,799
many thanks very exciting in any

439
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:21,699
case I'll

440
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:23,980
go into detail again right away but first

441
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,809
we'll continue with the

442
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:28,540
place where we are too martin who us the

443
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,069
brings the old shell a bit closer

444
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:32,189
so that you can also find

445
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:34,269
out what it actually means what

446
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:36,459
this is all about so martin you are

447
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:38,429
then exactly

448
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:40,139
remember

449
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:43,420
exactly I am part of the team of the old

450
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,660
shell who also runs this stage for

451
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,990
the rc 3 here and I hope

452
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,069
provides exciting content as

453
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:55,449
i have been in the group

454
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:57,220
for quite a long time, which has also existed for quite a long time, considering

455
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,559


456
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,059
that we actually bought a site more

457
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:02,879
spontaneously,

458
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,959
the group has actually grown over many years

459
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,690
,

460
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,980
we somehow started five six years

461
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,609
ago with the idea or something

462
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:15,230
more years that we

463
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,819
somehow want to buy and develop as a group in the area

464
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:20,200


465
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,160
and then also long after d

466
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,890
we looked for a suitable site, then

467
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,260
they found the old shell, we looked at it

468
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,050
and then bought it, and now

469
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,230
it's quite a lot of work,

470
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,070
actually, you've had a

471
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,740
lot of work before, but that's definitely

472
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,560


473
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,500


474
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,360
exactly the first one  a little

475
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,670
insight into our internal

476
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,860
documents, i.e. all the

477
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,120
tubes that we have regarding the site,

478
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,100
the various working groups

479
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,750
that take care of the various topics

480
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,340
that we have and

481
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,900
our communication

482
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,860


483
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,300
channels, which are overflowing with new messages even if you haven’t looked in for a few days, that’s right

484
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,400


485
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,220
quite a lot of work and

486
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,440
we

487
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,730
have also learned a great deal in the last few months, for

488
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,110
example building law, which we also

489
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,440
discussed with you, but it is

490
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,030
still definitely

491
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,560
something that you have to deal with if you want to realize a project like this

492
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,510
Must if you are not

493
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,870
indoors

494
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,710
or have already completed the development

495
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,360
plan if  you can simply implement it

496
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,590
, but if you

497
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,120
probably as soon as

498
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,800
we're somehow ready that we can say and we

499
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,790
've somehow realized the project

500
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,990
at least in the basics, we'll also

501
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,410
have a

502
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,810
dedicated day a car like

503
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,720
that, how to realize a project like that  could

504
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,970
at least use our example but

505
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:47,990
we're not that far yet it

506
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,420
will take a while

507
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,370
exactly what we don't want to achieve with

508
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,190
the location

509
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,990
our goal is to create a space

510
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,240
where ideas and projects can be

511
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,670
realized very roughly we actually come

512
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,680
from different contexts  welcome

513
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,230
from it we come from the trades

514
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,570
we come from the art and

515
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,789
culture sector

516
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:12,470
and we actually know each other

517
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,590
primarily because

518
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,760
we got to know each other at events

519
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,049
the various white people were

520
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:19,580
involved, including the chaos

521
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,710
communication congress but also the

522
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,820
cola claim  can I after those

523
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,649
karlsruhe and many other  Our

524
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:27,730
events and the idea was that we should use

525
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,130


526
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,620
these beautiful events and the beautiful

527
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,419
moments and the beautiful spaces that are

528
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:36,200
created there at the

529
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,360
events, that we create

530
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,010
something permanent to transfer

531
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,149
something that is not somehow torn down after five days

532
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:42,649
because something is always given

533
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:45,850
back  every time

534
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,809
you think about whether you

535
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:48,470
might

536
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,450
want to stay a little longer, but it's a bit

537
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,850
difficult to implement and here we want to

538
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,679
create a place where we

539
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:56,120
can leave things where they are

540
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,679
and where they can enjoy these rooms longer,

541
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,659


542
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:00,799
but exactly  now i'm looking forward

543
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,990
to the commuter and to it because the c3

544
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,480
organize

545
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,620
many thanks i took the

546
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,000
final picture on it again so

547
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,899
you can see what looks like here at the moment

548
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:13,700
we're already sitting

549
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,919
in the snow

550
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:17,360
and that's the pool on which we're

551
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,590
all already  friends in the summer to

552
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,190
use the or one of the pulse

553
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,950
so lars not over n  ot least there is

554
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,590
now the janosch beach, which has something to see for us

555
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,340
and tells smart village

556
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,990
and to be

557
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,179
precise yes, thank you very much, it is a

558
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:37,039
pity that leipzig does not take place,

559
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,450
but it is also nice that i only have to

560
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,059
drive half an hour

561
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:44,179
to come to the congress  it's exactly

562
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:46,340
about digitization country life should i

563
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,230
what does it actually have to do with one

564
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,240
i think so or the particular

565
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,250
challenge in the countryside is of course

566
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,470
the lack of density the lack of

567
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,480
population density that's kind of

568
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,010
nice because you have a lot of green in

569
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,080
between but that's what makes it  also

570
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,029
difficult to organize

571
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,980
mobility to organize meeting rooms and so

572
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,049
on and i think

573
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:07,850
digitization can simply be a huge

574
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,470
help that is, so to speak, the big

575
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,200
approach to digitization that the city

576
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,530
doesn’t have like

577
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,960
that rural areas don’t exactly need it and I would

578
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,910
like to have two projects  imagine or three

579
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,830
even that he of a coconut that is,

580
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,180
so to speak, the proje  kt with whom i ended up here

581
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,850
in hoch fläming that's

582
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,650
what we plan to do we founded it five years ago that's

583
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,470
exactly what you see there the

584
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,500
pallet sign it's an old

585
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,040
manor that we bought from the

586
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,440
municipality of bad belzig and said we

587
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,960
want coworking  we transferred the topic

588
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,460
to the rural area, so to speak,

589
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,920
and connected it with a country hotel

590
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,080
and basically simply developed group

591
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,180
versus as a tourist product, so to speak

592
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,730
, and called it

593
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,560
location and that worked really well

594
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,420
the whole thing we did as a company, we did it

595
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,930
as a

596
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,610
social enterprise  the desire

597
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,410
to bring something to the region when we did

598
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,610
n't just want to bring tourists there,

599
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,160
we wanted to use digitization, so to speak,

600
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,020


601
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,660
to develop some kind of exciting projects in rural areas

602
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,380


603
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,240
it's a great region that's

604
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,700
been said several times it was totally

605
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,550
well received we're doing it

606
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,650
meanwhile we are not just a hotel with

607
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,110
coworki  ng but we have projects that,

608
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,300
so to speak, pick up on things that already exist here

609
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,060
in the region, for example

610
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,100
crafts, there is something where we have maker

611
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,380
space with computer-controlled production

612
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,420
methods, we are currently building them up, if

613
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,910
yes, in the old cowshed and then, so to speak,

614
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,260
with the

615
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,720
craftswomen and

616
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,220
artists  to make things from the region

617
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,260
but also

618
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,420
to bring startups out here

619
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,880
that produce material things here or another topic where you can see

620
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,340


621
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,070
digitization in rural areas quite well

622
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,710
we are now doing gamers retreat in april

623
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,020
so where game developers 15 game

624
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,120
developers go to small glien  come to our

625
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,930
small village of 50 souls to spend

626
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:08,850
a month developing scripts

627
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,130
there no idea everything possible in the field of

628
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,200
gaming and that is

629
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,030
exactly what the artists did a hundred years

630
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,560
ago like never before or the

631
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,360
artists when his

632
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,780
artist colony in the arts were him or  in

633
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,370
our artist house or something like

634
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,980
that  this is exactly

635
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,050
what is taking effect on the state parliament retreat for creativity

636
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,630
or another project that is to be

637
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,130
done now there are really great

638
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,020
hiking trails here, the high fläming is

639
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,030
a hiking region and there is now the

640
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,550
super beautiful art hiking trail that leads from bad

641
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,070
belzig and wiesenburg and there

642
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,590
we have it  we are currently receiving funding that

643
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,040
we can add a third level to this

644
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,050
analog natural beautiful

645
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,490
constant way with the

646
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,820
artworks on a third level

647
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,160
where the artists

648
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,900
explain their artworks as avatars, so to speak

649
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,700
, and where we also make an

650
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,410
international call for

651
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,660
purely digital artworks, so to speak, where

652
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,400
then exactly  this nature and

653
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,980
digitization is connected

654
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,050
but always like this examples of what we

655
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,470
do we are not just a hotel

656
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,580
accessibility of people is,

657
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,200
so to speak, always how do you actually get that

658
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,790
to the population to the

659
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,440
politicians the politicians are

660
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,820
relatively accessible here it’s not that

661
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,370
difficult  and  you get to the people

662
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,870
then they would all be people we

663
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,610
somehow did a workshop first

664
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,740
everyone was invited come here me

665
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,110
talk to us about what ideas you

666
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,120
had what do you want what do you want to do

667
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,380
and have these ideas

668
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,640
realized afterwards in this historic

669
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,550
estate and

670
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,790
events  so here you can see, for example,

671
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:44,010
this little moose this is this

672
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,510
this this deer in the corner this is the

673
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,460
plaintiffs creative at home this is a

674
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,570
festival we do every year or

675
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,280
exactly we have the pizzeria here

676
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,040
pizzeria kokolores as a papa pizzeria

677
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,380
everyone likes pizza  it doesn’t matter whether

678
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,780
you can use the computer or not that’s

679
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,480
exactly classic

680
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,860
and because there were more and more

681
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,570
projects and more and more projects

682
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,970
like that of rural development

683
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,660
digitization we then

684
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,830
founded an association that’s the next slide

685
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,660
that’s exactly what this smart village

686
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,450
ev has  we before then we won the

687
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,350


688
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,360
tender exactly two and a half years ago

689
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,340
the

690
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,200
media institute berlin brandenburg then founded the association

691
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,660
with the municipalities with the

692
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,490
märkische Allgemeine Zeitung and we

693
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:32,309
have

694
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:33,929
now financed a small project

695
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:35,780
team which, so to speak, implements

696
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,950
digitization projects in the

697
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,580
region and because it was important to us that

698
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,530
that is, so to speak  the local association and

699
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,760
then we founded a second association

700
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,130
, a network of places of future, to support

701
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,799
other actors nationwide

702
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,150
and also

703
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,390
to create such crystallization nuclei as

704
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,000
the two here are also present

705
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,520
exactly we are so happy that we have now ended

706
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,790
up here and exactly

707
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,799
I think that's the future, so to speak, that

708
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,110
somehow brings the country

709
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,000
forward and so the country that

710
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,919
holds the rural area can also be an

711
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:13,100
innovation driver

712
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,890
, thank you very much, too, the first thing that of

713
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,600
course totally struck you

714
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,510
is that with everyone or

715
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,799
contribution or even on the fol  hen the

716
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,990
other groups came up how does

717
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,090
the topic of networking look so

718
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,950
general heard that is already here

719
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,540
but how is it because of your

720
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,890
experience or also the interests of

721
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,690
the now we would like to say first

722
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,750


723
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,820
it was a great key point that

724
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,799
somehow shows nicely  how much

725
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:48,240
such a culture of welcoming

726
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,610
pays off for regions can you also

727
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:54,410
invest a certain amount in experiments yes

728
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,669
exactly for projects like this also

729
00:26:56,669 --> 00:26:59,299
because this time i want

730
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:01,410
this tender we became aware of bad

731
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,970
belzig and

732
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,559
we had already pursued it before because it was

733
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,030
yes really very early on

734
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,650
another location before that you

735
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,179
then noticed that's cool you're

736
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,150
here there is this this award

737
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,830
i just asked roland den Bürger

738
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,110
bad belzig robe he then

739
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,940
didn't have a suitable property for the cover got

740
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,770
me  then just a market referenced a

741
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,049
village further a community further we ended up

742
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:24,929
there totally lucky  cklich and now

743
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:26,850
you are here we notice that the well-known

744
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,950
golf course has been added in the

745
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,169
meantime so there are now

746
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:32,669
two years of development that is completely

747
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:34,020
unbelievable what has happened here in these two years

748
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,280
and it is precisely

749
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,530
due to the fact that it is similar here I

750
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,730
actually like to compare it

751
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,430
with the internet how is it

752
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,390
somehow at the beginning we still experienced

753
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,010
this awakening phase as somehow

754
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,020
exciting and not completely

755
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,060
commercialized there was also

756
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,590
a lot of support,

757
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,790
so whoever turned to other projects with

758
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,050
it, they were also

759
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,300
pioneers  were they actually

760
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,130
there they were rejected there was

761
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,480
just a lot of mutual

762
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,010
support that's exactly what i experience

763
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,690
under i love here now when it comes to

764
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,700
rural areas so if you go in there

765
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,650
with this attitude that you

766
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,570
really don't just think about yourself

767
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,770
but also what the project wants to give back

768
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,120
is also there  s in the end

769
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,430
the common good also benefits from it and

770
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,020
so all projects are still ticking at the moment

771
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,610
whether their time whether their time now

772
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,930
many other projects the network

773
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,000
future places almost everyone says everyone who

774
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,650
is represented there ticks the same way

775
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:23,140
and you help each other just

776
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,250
like that  How about the mayor, you

777
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,240
mayors, who have already

778
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,620
set off what that looks like

779
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,360
, they also help each other, well

780
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,920
, right now, I really think it's

781
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,100
such a totally magical great time because

782
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,170
it's not over yet, well, it

783
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,420
's just still is  there is still a lot of work to be done,

784
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,790
so building law right now, so you

785
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,170
're still biting your teeth on a lot of issues

786
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,410
,

787
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,400
the banks don't play along with many things

788
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,320
where it's not just ours,

789
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,390
but also immense, so there's

790
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,530
still a lot of challenges, but I

791
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,450
really would  say so the access to

792
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,920
other projects the support

793
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,510
you experience in this ecosystem is

794
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,650
definitely just ke  ine of this

795
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,000
challenge but is a huge

796
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,070
strength and i really hope that

797
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,900
we somehow manage to keep this atmosphere going

798
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,660
a little longer

799
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,190
than that on the internet we have to

800
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,660
realize that of course even when it comes to

801
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,370
ground there is always a lot of

802
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,950
money at stake  and the danger that is of course

803
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,090
always there with all our projects

804
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,770
is if we somehow

805
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,080
make it too nice for ourselves, others will also

806
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,670
notice and i think that's

807
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,990
really we're not there anymore

808
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,220
but that's always a bit of

809
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,530
something  there's still a little bit above

810
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,720
everything and where we think we're

811
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,330
already doing a good job of advising you to

812
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,680
prevent that, I think marco is

813
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,600
great,

814
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,650
you're doing it just as well, so where is

815
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,870
that already hinted at when it

816
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,840
comes to that now  municipal land

817
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,430
for sale that's how you ca

818
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,750
n't look at the investors with the

819
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,580
deepest pockets yet, but of course the

820
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,110
money has to be there somehow  in order to

821
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,210
also revitalize these spaces but in the end

822
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,289
the concept wins and especially

823
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:50,240
public interest-oriented organizations with it so

824
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,149
that cooperatives clubs are associations

825
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:54,740
yes we will prefer that i think it

826
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,269
is really really important that

827
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:58,340
the municipality keeps an eye on it and

828
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,178
also controls it accordingly

829
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:03,950
i would pick it up right away because

830
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:06,799
it actually works and control that

831
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,610
as well as friedrich recently said

832
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,590
we are a peripheral region the

833
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,450
affluent belt of berlin carried further

834
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:18,230
outwards and the greatest danger i see

835
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,070
as mayor is that

836
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,899
we generate settlements here at the weekend because of

837
00:30:23,899 --> 00:30:25,880
that  Berliners have a

838
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,889
higher income, it is usually

839
00:30:27,889 --> 00:30:30,950
about a third higher, so even

840
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,169
if they have higher rents, they

841
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:34,639
generate more income and can

842
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:37,669
always put that aside in order

843
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,220
to buy a yard or a house here

844
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,990
and they should  gladly do if you

845
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,690
would also move here but do that

846
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:47,899
now  not many at the moment so if you drive everyone to

847
00:30:47,899 --> 00:30:49,179
the region in

848
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:51,409
january piece has been here for a long time

849
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:52,639
you can certainly confirm there are

850
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:55,029
hardly any vacancies but

851
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:57,230
we still have a third fewer

852
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,299
inhabitants here it’s simply a

853
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:01,250
beautiful region and people

854
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,620
then buy theirs here  weekend home and we're

855
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,179
doing the broadband

856
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:07,039
expansion we reserve the daycare places we have everything there

857
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:11,360
and just keep thinking why

858
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,580
is this step missing and that's why we've

859
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,549
now gone on the offensive have

860
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:19,610
actively spoken to people you do

861
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,649
n't want a permanent goal and didn't want to

862
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:23,049
project do

863
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:25,700
that, by the way, this networking then takes place

864
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,010
from the point of view of the administration so city

865
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,450
that we try to be present at every

866
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,039
interesting

867
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,750
event how to send either from

868
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,399
wiesenburg mark uth from bad belzig more so that we

869
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:35,870
don’t miss anything and

870
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:38,059
always have the change

871
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:39,710
for example, if the state organizes an event

872
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,330
in potsdam or if i  at the berlin

873
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,909
congress someone goes and says

874
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:45,769
the best place is here in

875
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:48,610
hoch fläming, by the way, we have the command

876
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,590
on the old shell

877
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,630
, so

878
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:58,700
from my point of view it becomes a shoe and if we are so

879
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,010
present then that happens too

880
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,750
that people also speak to us, that

881
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,160
means if some people call

882
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,360
sometimes sold, then yes,

883
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,710
then there is a positive basic mood,

884
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,930
almost a spirit of optimism and

885
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,090
many people

886
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,590
don't want to counteract that, talk to us,

887
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,260
nobody knows them and

888
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,510
then we can  even with design, yes,

889
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:23,890
where else would the money come from

890
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:27,260
, even our people are taking it up now

891
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,450
and are also considering who they are going to sell

892
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,550
the property to and i think that's so

893
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,800
nice that everyone is actually

894
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,230
trying to shape this change now

895
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,870
and, in my opinion, the role model function must

896
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,240
also come to an end  coming to the administration

897
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,720
and building law is one thing because they

898
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,100
don't care if so many people are interested, but

899
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,410
I don't know  nn tell you everyone who

900
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,960
is planning such a project should definitely

901
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,340
talk to the mayor beforehand it

902
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,220
is not that easy to

903
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,820
build 23 or in the outside area

904
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,310
you should know beforehand where and what you can

905
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,680
do i would be very quick i don't think

906
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,850
everyone  here knows what actually means

907
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,490
outside and inside just want

908
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,260
to explain it very briefly

909
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,370
right away which martin first me is also so

910
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,700
intensively involved with it so the german

911
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,710
building law provides for two different

912
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,600
categories and if you build within

913
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,820
a village then within the

914
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,140
closed village and  only in the

915
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,330
area where

916
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,970
there are designated development plans

917
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,740
then you are in the inner area there you are somehow allowed to do

918
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,120
what you normally see

919
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,830
in the inner area of somehow

920
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,440
villages and cities and in

921
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,810
germany it is very reluctant to

922
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,130
see that

923
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,900
you realize any things that are not

924
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,820
within  closed towns

925
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,040
in it, which was definitely his reason

926
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,720
for example, the infrastructure

927
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,130
costs for this are significantly higher you have to

928
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,480
build the roads but

929
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,070
scandalization then only push electricity but the

930
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,970
mobility-technically it is of course

931
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:55,390
difficult to connect such places and

932
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:57,380
that is why there is actually

933
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,300
my husband allowed to go on a

934
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,890
free land at some point, so to speak

935
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,690
make a farm and much more is

936
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,170
difficult

937
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,990
yes thank you

938
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,340
it is definitely not

939
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,989
always clear to everyone what that actually is i

940
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,489
said to myself that at the beginning only conditionally

941
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:14,649
what

942
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:16,429
now we have heard a

943
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,080
lot that there is really great

944
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,360
support and networks  and a lot of

945
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,149
support, but also areas

946
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:24,710
that are a bit more strenuous and since

947
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,600
my question was asked again

948
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,399
, there were some

949
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,090
special and also completely unexpected

950
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,739
obstacles

951
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,699
. I have heard a lot of support, but

952
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,199
you would also like to be something like that

953
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,969
went wrong was

954
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:40,850
difficult was there because there wa  s with

955
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,750
you in front of you are there

956
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,219
that was that was particularly difficult

957
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:49,300
because we have to get by first

958
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,429
I could definitely be very

959
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,750
present again it is with us

960
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,000
right now that the purchase came from somewhere

961
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,830
so the financing was already there

962
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,450
addressed that is definitely a

963
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:02,870
hurdle that you have to take that is

964
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,360
not very easy, among other things,

965
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,160
if you don’t come up with a

966
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,560
08 15 project like somehow I

967
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,470
need a family house

968
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,790
somewhere with a somehow standard

969
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,440
standard although every bank somehow

970
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,720
just somehow gets through it  a

971
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,660
process is postponed and then it's okay

972
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,740
then it will definitely become more difficult

973
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,980
so there are only a few banks

974
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,750
that do that because many banks

975
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,880
somehow have no ideas how

976
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,910
to deal with it and then it

977
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,670
depends very much on bank from bank

978
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,530
to the bank from how complicated the process

979
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,790
is in how much information they

980
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:39,720
probably have, of course they also want your

981
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,520
credit risk of some kind  And how to

982
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,860
calculate and somehow measure that,

983
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:47,190
which definitely takes time and that

984
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:50,130
two things that we were fortunately

985
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,070
able to act through a lot of work

986
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,890
is that there are people with

987
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,920
deep pockets, so in our case we also have

988
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,930
some sort of competitors that we then

989
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,880
primarily  outdid us because

990
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,200
we established a really good connection to the

991
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,170
saleswoman, thanks again

992
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,220
to the person

993
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,930
who sees it, took it upon himself

994
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:10,910
privately

995
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,920
and

996
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,120
would have managed that we were so

997
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,260
convincing that we were

998
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,910
a principle for her life's work  I would have been

999
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,560
running this hotel here for 30 years. It

1000
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,720
was that we

1001
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,640
are somehow continuing to do something useful with

1002
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,940
it and that is definitely

1003
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,560
something where you have to stay on the ball if you always

1004
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,170
have to,

1005
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,450
exactly what people no longer say is

1006
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,830
support programs it gets like that  before

1007
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,140
as if it were sold anyway,

1008
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,870
there are extremely many support programs

1009
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,290
, but most of them are  s for very classic

1010
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,860
investment funding and if,

1011
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,540
like you, you probably

1012
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,820
lend a hand in some way and then none of this

1013
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,250
can be billed and you did

1014
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,440
n’t get three offers and

1015
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,080
so i can do that extremely difficult at the beginning

1016
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,160
so precisely and the building rights

1017
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,810
i actually like that  German building law,

1018
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,460
yes, I will do that somehow, it's

1019
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,560
great that everyone can have a say, all

1020
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,450
environmentalists and all fire protection officers

1021
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,430
and so on, and that makes a lot like with everything

1022
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,860
individually, it's totally

1023
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,860
terrible salt as a whole,

1024
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,180
exactly, but I'm not arguing because

1025
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,130
I'm always totally

1026
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,870
convincing  but find it incredibly

1027
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,360
tiring and you need unbelievable

1028
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,460
time

1029
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,630
i would maybe add two more things

1030
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,120
if we now

1031
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,000
think about the cow village it is not so common

1032
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,070
for a new village to be built and that of

1033
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,530
course leads to reservations with

1034
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,200
certain people out of the

1035
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,540
village who say man the scots

1036
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:42,980
then from the project looks of course

1037
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,230
quite  but if people

1038
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,730
don't come up to you

1039
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,280
you have to catch yourself and for me it was

1040
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,680
always important to make it clear to people, for example

1041
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,050
who do you prefer here

1042
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,810
buy 20 berlin entries a

1043
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,460
house the neighbors don't know and so on

1044
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:02,180
and lay  then first of all with

1045
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,580
that because the 52 cm is on the

1046
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,890
property boundary because the

1047
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,570
property

1048
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,100
boundaries were not properly measured in the old days

1049
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,890
or we have a cooperative the

1050
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,690
people have known each other for

1051
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,520
over two years they then get to know each other

1052
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,010
together and because of that  he

1053
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,690
know each other it's actually like a

1054
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,600
real village yes because it's because they

1055
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,980
've already built up the relationship

1056
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,660
if i could choose that as mayor

1057
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,970
then again 20 or

1058
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,250
20 i would always tend towards the cooperative

1059
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,580
that i wanted to come to him

1060
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,350
often  say and the financing

1061
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,630
is a bit special moderately with us

1062
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,300
I'm more left mayor but d  he

1063
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,680
thing with the financing of the really

1064
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,600
difficult because that also leads to there

1065
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,460
are deductions in rural areas, ie

1066
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,370
the banks when they see that the

1067
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,230
periphery there is nothing going on the prices

1068
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,990
are stable or falling take the

1069
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,970
deductions that means you need more

1070
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,650
equity what the people  because of the

1071
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,420
lower income we don't have it at all here

1072
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,400
that means our own people

1073
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,590
can no longer afford a house at all so what

1074
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,540
have we done our own people

1075
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,890
have at least reason to

1076
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:08,900
have land we said okay we'll let

1077
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,360
the land prices rise now and

1078
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,090
as a community we have building land  sold at

1079
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,820
twice its value

1080
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,850
and that means the cow is worth so yes,

1081
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,590
the price has doubled

1082
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,830
but it’s still quite good at 35 euros

1083
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:27,590
in my opinion and

1084
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:30,870
that’s legal

1085
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,160
[laughter] so

1086
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,100
I hope well

1087
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,330
if the banks do that  now

1088
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,880
noticed but when the banks are now

1089
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,430
looking, they are always looking for the

1090
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,270
expert committees, then you see

1091
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,980
your mom now  ent the prices have

1092
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,720
gone through the roof here the people

1093
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,600
get the credit so you also have

1094
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,890
to think about this

1095
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:56,300
infrastructure and otherwise, as

1096
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,890
I said, it will be even more difficult for our own people who

1097
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,450
have even less income than the people of

1098
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,580
Berlin and that’s why

1099
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,410
it is  I think even if the

1100
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,780
paradox sounds like a good plan,

1101
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,150


1102
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:10,160
let's see, ok, I think we're slowly getting

1103
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,330
to the part of a social

1104
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:14,180
game that has to play errors together

1105
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,370
,

1106
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,480
the panel also has this topic

1107
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,950
with digitization and

1108
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,560
it was discussed earlier  spoken

1109
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,910
broadband expansion is still pending on the

1110
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:25,510
other hand gruber king is already running

1111
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:28,250
how well it works because that really

1112
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,870
because that's often such a concern

1113
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,670
on the one hand you always hear

1114
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,950
the broadband expansion is progressing, especially

1115
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,110
in the country so sometimes you hear

1116
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,910
there are villages, there is glass before

1117
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,800
it sometimes arrives in big cities,

1118
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,470
but maybe mags  t you also

1119
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,090
start how is it working for you it

1120
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,770
’s with the connection

1121
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,710
so we don’t have fiber

1122
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,940
optics but only 100 megabits of copper

1123
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,070
but that’s still because not

1124
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,960
as many people are connected as in the city

1125
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,610
and you don’t have as many overlapping

1126
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,760
wifi  networks that all

1127
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,170
interfere with each other and everyone

1128
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,760
screws another antenna

1129
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,080
to the wall somehow it is actually enough for

1130
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,000
hundreds of people at the same time who are on site

1131
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,010
with somehow different devices

1132
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,920


1133
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,140
coworking works for us

1134
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,220
we often get like that

1135
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,770
prime example but we are

1136
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,570
actually not premieres coworking

1137
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:25,760
space but this location topic so

1138
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,220
people come out to us to work

1139
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,320
like a commercial monastery

1140
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,240
digital conventions the monastery

1141
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,980
or a country like go that you

1142
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,800
can rent but we also have

1143
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,640
classic coworking

1144
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,740
also

1145
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,900
about 15 local coworkers this

1146
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,299
monthly contribution  ag numbers come to us

1147
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:47,400
we also have about 15

1148
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,900
companies that have now

1149
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,400
settled with us

1150
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,349
who work with us if they are not already so

1151
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:53,609
big that they actually rent their own

1152
00:41:53,609 --> 00:41:55,950
premises so it

1153
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:58,400
works in any case

1154
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,200
a one point that I still really like  important

1155
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,210
to digitalization what we did when we

1156
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,710
came here five years ago

1157
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:07,559
gave me total problems

1158
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:10,230
reaching people because we only had one

1159
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,950
newspaper there were no pubs there was

1160
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,329
something so difficult you

1161
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:16,410
can’t go to the supermarket all day

1162
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,410
standing at the checkout and waiting for everyone to

1163
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,720
come by so and that's why what we did at the

1164
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,460
very beginning is very much based

1165
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,309
on the project, that means in this country

1166
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:28,440
where it's about media

1167
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,799
competence where we support the training talk

1168
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,779
here somehow so

1169
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:36,539
a tv show that produces here  will

1170
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:38,670
barn in wiesenburg e-mails we have

1171
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,700
podcast we have a supporting

1172
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,009
digital citizen newspaper and we ha  Above

1173
00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:45,900
all, we are very strongly committed to the

1174
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,380
fact that a smart village

1175
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,569
app like this is developed here, which then also bundles such

1176
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,059
different

1177
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:55,410
media content, so to speak, now

1178
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,930
an open-source solution to simply

1179
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,789
achieve media diversity here,

1180
00:42:59,789 --> 00:43:01,470
to have a platform at all, why,

1181
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,059
how to reach people  can and

1182
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:04,980
is used by two and a half thousand

1183
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,960
people, which is a quarter of the population

1184
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,509
of bad belzig so it works

1185
00:43:09,509 --> 00:43:11,339
well and there is the one without

1186
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,470
digitization that's what i mean by this one

1187
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:15,059
here there isn't this density and

1188
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:18,140
these meeting places

1189
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,650
audi has lived quite well right now  fresh

1190
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:25,049
as well we hope that this violence

1191
00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:26,940
will come we are looking forward to it in any

1192
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,990
case our current setup is

1193
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:33,250
we have 16 one dsl line where it comes

1194
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:36,290
out that is for the things that

1195
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,850
should run

1196
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,950
reasonably stable then we still have two three thick

1197
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,470
lte antennas

1198
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:44,290
sometimes 20 come out

1199
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:47,480
on the roof and the starling antenna on the

1200
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,619
roof has i  somehow still regularly

1201
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:49,760
suspend if we don't yet know

1202
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,640
why because of that a relatively

1203
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,869
large amount of data comes through but that's

1204
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:55,310
not stable now company a video conference

1205
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:57,100
otto

1206
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,100
and

1207
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,890
what forgot,

1208
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:06,170
for example, the rest of the team on the topic of

1209
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,369
digitization how many people

1210
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:09,920
can reach or hello people I had

1211
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,060
thought about it  still has sometime

1212
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,420
in the uplink

1213
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:17,180
so soon the phase is coming is that in

1214
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,900
any case it will be better then

1215
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,580
exactly so with people achieve that well

1216
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,840
I also grew up in the village

1217
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,430
so that was when you

1218
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,840
either you can join a

1219
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,430
sports club but otherwise  there weren't

1220
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:30,110
many opportunities to

1221
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,400
get to know each other somehow and so there was

1222
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,020
a bar you could go to

1223
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,010
but it closed at some

1224
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:36,440
point and i think the

1225
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,119
digitization made you

1226
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:40,760
realize that i say it was younger

1227
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,100
then  This has come up on a whole social

1228
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,570
network, which

1229
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:45,950
definitely gave it a boost

1230
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,230
but that was the problem, like everywhere else, that of

1231
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,240
course the media competence

1232
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,340
somehow didn’t grow as quickly

1233
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,300
as the use of the technologies,

1234
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,770
which,

1235
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:00,180
among other things, also motivated me to

1236
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,530
be very active in this area somehow

1237
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:03,480
with smart school in a project

1238
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,180
that  somehow

1239
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,010
tried to teach students how to

1240
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:09,480
actually deal with a technical school at school,

1241
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,830
the teachers couldn't

1242
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,810
teach because they

1243
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,360
didn't grow up with the technology himself and

1244
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,970
how the hell is he planning to

1245
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:20,100
ask the tough question, a bit funny

1246
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,590
,

1247
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:24,660
with the that  tackling the topic yes

1248
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,810
then also making contact with the locals

1249
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,390
etc.

1250
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:31,680
on the one hand quite similarly with somehow

1251
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,180
an open day in hopefully

1252
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,920
as soon as the corona numbers no longer

1253
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,660
look so bad can somehow implement

1254
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,430
them, but on the other hand of course always

1255
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:40,260
have researched the area first

1256
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,720


1257
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,640
the wide range of

1258
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,860
offers that exist  that somehow the forum is what

1259
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:51,560
results or the different channels

1260
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,790
around the different events when

1261
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:56,460
we were already at the participatory

1262
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,040
conference there are quite simply a

1263
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,120
lot of offers here too that

1264
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:05,910
i think we don't have a digital plan

1265
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,290
yet that can somehow be rolled out in

1266
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,050
the  direction

1267
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:11,910
how is it looking there you

1268
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,200
have little ones i my side not on site

1269
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,880
yet but he comes with a

1270
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,680
whole yes actually with a whole orchestra yes

1271
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,770


1272
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:21,900
yes and crown of course like everyone here

1273
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,430
already made a dash through the

1274
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:24,270
bill we wanted of course

1275
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:25,830
also organizing various formats on

1276
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,780
site was then a specialist conference for me,

1277
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,520
so whatever kind of

1278
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,869
event took place here

1279
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:32,460
anyway, we always used it

1280
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,350
to advertise our project, but the

1281
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:35,880
actual idea was

1282
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,100
to spend weekends outside again over several months to

1283
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,360
get to know all the actors

1284
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,070
to present our or to the actors

1285
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,960
in turn  n

1286
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,130
we just had to postpone that again i

1287
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,240
hope this summer the time has finally come

1288
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,240
it was clear that it is super important

1289
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,160
because with digitization i want to

1290
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,590
make one more

1291
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:54,150
point, namely that these also appear

1292
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,500
again and again in this

1293
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,600
digitization context but i

1294
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,619
understand the cow village frankly

1295
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:02,310
only depends after its project because the

1296
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,110
digitization for us actually already

1297
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:05,820
so that on the one hand totally

1298
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,680
self-evident but we do

1299
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,530
n't necessarily have developers

1300
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:11,910
with us at the core but people who just

1301
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,470
somehow just work on the net only those who

1302
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:14,820
work for  research institute the

1303
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,160
work for start-ups the work of a

1304
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,330
journalist whatever and

1305
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:22,619
i find the exciting thing actually more

1306
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:25,619
like this in our context this

1307
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:27,540
topic social innovation because in the

1308
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,600
last few years so much attention has been drawn

1309
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,920
to the topic of technology of

1310
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,869
course quite rightly that is one

1311
00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:35,280
incredible low emission zone st  attfindet and

1312
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,930
that's super important but i think the

1313
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:38,490
social thing just fell behind in this whole

1314
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:40,560
discourse and

1315
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,670
i think that's so great here again,

1316
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:43,530
especially in this interaction you

1317
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,359
somehow have everything of course it's

1318
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:46,950
great what your projects have done

1319
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,240
there we can rely on  but we

1320
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,500
don't have to

1321
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,270
reinvent the village here somehow, but if, for

1322
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:52,590
example, we manage to bring more culture to the region simply because of the

1323
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:54,330
size we bring with us,

1324
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,140


1325
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,150


1326
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:00,370
that helped everyone again and

1327
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:01,390
somehow that's exciting about

1328
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:03,010
ecosystems  but exactly my pumps

1329
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:04,450
just like that this social innovation

1330
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:05,770
i think deserves a lot more

1331
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:06,820
attention, especially

1332
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,260
when it comes to the funding program but that is

1333
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,940
really a huge problem everything that is

1334
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,320
somehow so classically common good

1335
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,820
is somehow killed with

1336
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,320
volunteering but that's just a lot

1337
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,820
i think  also understandably

1338
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,010
unreasonable  if you somehow

1339
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:20,080
don't have much time the family job i think it

1340
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,210
's just i have a lot of respect

1341
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,250
for everyone who does this on a voluntary

1342
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:25,900
basis but i think it

1343
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,290
just needs a lot more funding for

1344
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:31,050
projects that aren't necessarily the

1345
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:33,160
most technologically

1346
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,810
innovative but they are  make it clear let's just create

1347
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,430
social added value here let's

1348
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,260
reactivate the places

1349
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,540
we let culture take place and

1350
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,520
that's just more important

1351
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,680
because I think it's almost ideal here

1352
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,000
somehow in this ecosystem we already

1353
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,190
represent an old technology alone

1354
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,630
doesn't help you don't need it

1355
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:52,110
you can’t fill the app with content either,

1356
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:54,460
but now we’ve

1357
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,800
heard a thing or two about funding, of course,

1358
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,720
i can imagine that

1359
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,480
marco still needs to say something about this

1360
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,430
last point

1361
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:05,530
about funding and how

1362
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:08,470
digitization is almost done here  exactly so

1363
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:10,030
digitization but also maybe

1364
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,430
this social  e component so this

1365
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:14,890
ahead or can you then make special

1366
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,840
plans I mean now start here as

1367
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,720
much as

1368
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,780
you have seen the mind map that

1369
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,920
is always difficult for the

1370
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,330
community representatives yes they are

1371
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,160
my bosses so to speak who we

1372
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,450
always have to follow and our level of

1373
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:31,440
indebtedness will  we have now reached the

1374
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,270
legal end point

1375
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,850
but we are also investing so that

1376
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:39,180
means we have gone a lot for

1377
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,070
I think it is a good investment and a few

1378
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:44,350
projects that are important

1379
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:46,030
because we no longer have a restaurant where

1380
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:48,610
people meet and we also have them, for

1381
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,290
example  smart city funding raised

1382
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:55,140
together with coconut and

1383
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,720
neuland 21, for example also as a

1384
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,680
cooperation partner here

1385
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,020
and this group as a whole simply attracts

1386
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,480
even more funding viviano agrees

1387
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,930
that at some point

1388
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:12,580
this funding crisis is no longer

1389
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,170
feasible on a voluntary basis that this project is built to

1390
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:15,520
live and that’s why I can too

1391
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,990
say we have all now  in for

1392
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:19,240
wiesenburg/mark 15 million

1393
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,070
together with babette about six million euros

1394
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:24,490
for the smart city project by the end of 2000

1395
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:27,010
27 that means there would also be

1396
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:29,710
pioneers again operation wiesenburg

1397
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:33,720
or both different

1398
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,980
digitization projects will be pushed in

1399
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:39,160
the meantime and what else we in

1400
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,990
wiesenburg  want to do is you

1401
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:42,450
know that certainly

1402
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:44,710


1403
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,540
village community houses we have next to the place once these are always the

1404
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,600
houses that are still best

1405
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,770
maintained because a lot of

1406
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:53,260
funding has already gone in and the

1407
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,610
village community houses were actually

1408
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:56,710
to blame for why restaurants broke

1409
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:58,690
down because after the reunification

1410
00:50:58,690 --> 00:50:59,590
you prefer to celebrate at the village community center

1411
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:02,580
because you could carry the crates of beer

1412
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:05,220
with you and then

1413
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:08,830
you don’t have to pay so dearly at the inn and

1414
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:11,980
yes, briefly upstairs, I would like us to have

1415
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,630
these village community centers, some of which

1416
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:15,700
are old schools, yes, where the whole

1417
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,290
floor would be empty  I like 

1418
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:22,109
create projects like in the coworking space

1419
00:51:22,109 --> 00:51:25,270
shared offices but there is

1420
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:28,810
the type of use it will now also be

1421
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:30,910
very diverse so office it can always

1422
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:33,750
be locked how you use it together

1423
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,109
accommodation possibilities

1424
00:51:35,109 --> 00:51:37,180
we want to

1425
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,590
try to bring all that in with this funding in

1426
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:39,780
different places

1427
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,820
we have old consumption  in niger

1428
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,460
huts i always have to

1429
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:47,230
show the mayor who is always very

1430
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:50,619
skeptical yes but now offered

1431
00:51:50,619 --> 00:51:52,300
for such a project i'm

1432
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,040
really proud of our people that

1433
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,990
they open up there who is right in the middle

1434
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:57,660
you always drive past it  and the

1435
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:01,530
roles are so low yes that

1436
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:04,619
means only 14,

1437
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:07,240
make something out of it and see that

1438
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,850
life moves back into the village with 100 inhabitants

1439
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:13,600
and then at the end of 2027 for me

1440
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,450
personally it should be the case that we

1441
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,609


1442
00:52:18,609 --> 00:52:20,650
relocate ten percent of the jobs back to them  we lost

1443
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:23,349
in the last 30 years that does

1444
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,880
n't sound like much maybe ten

1445
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,289
p.m  rozent but those are the ones we

1446
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:28,240
can bring back so you

1447
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,279
have to say goodbye to the fact that the

1448
00:52:30,279 --> 00:52:32,140
handicraft businesses and industrial companies are

1449
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,930
here with

1450
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:35,829
me and we say we definitely want to

1451
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:37,480
produce in wiesenburg

1452
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,569
next to not but we have to say

1453
00:52:40,569 --> 00:52:42,010
whatever a conviction political

1454
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,470
persuasion work people  stop

1455
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:46,240
now we're not going to the

1456
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,809
expo real now, we're going to

1457
00:52:49,809 --> 00:52:51,309
the digitization process now get the

1458
00:52:51,309 --> 00:52:53,470
people who can work from here or

1459
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,630
make sure in the coworking space that our

1460
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,950
people who are already in the home

1461
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:59,200
office but sit alone on three or four

1462
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,720
sides of the call  which can't be the

1463
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,359
future either yes 40 hours home

1464
00:53:04,359 --> 00:53:07,240
office and you know but steffen is

1465
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,940
two farms away you can also make

1466
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,349
yourself comfortable in the village

1467
00:53:11,349 --> 00:53:14,279
community center and create jobs for ten people

1468
00:53:14,279 --> 00:53:16,569
everyone has an

1469
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:20,230
employer but i think that could be in

1470
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,150
in one place or another

1471
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:24,400
it works everywhere too  different just like

1472
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,260
our society but i find it so

1473
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:27,910
incredibly exciting and we are of

1474
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:29,319
course grateful for having acquired the means

1475
00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:30,990
even if it is really

1476
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:34,480
complicated to spend them but the

1477
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,339
great thing here in the region is that

1478
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:37,990
we have now put it on a full-time

1479
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:40,240
basis and that’s why this  I think it will

1480
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,319
be managed well for the next few years,

1481
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:45,059
yes

1482
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:47,460
that sounds

1483
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,559
good, because of the corona

1484
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,839
crisis, one or the other has now

1485
00:53:52,839 --> 00:53:54,819
even seen how much is possible in the home

1486
00:53:54,819 --> 00:53:56,410
office and is capable of that even there, a

1487
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:58,470
little bit

1488
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:01,390
interesting for people to

1489
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:04,000
he too to say okay i'm moving abroad

1490
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,589
there are offers i don't even have

1491
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:07,059
to sit alone in my office all

1492
00:54:07,059 --> 00:54:08,529
day but above all the

1493
00:54:08,529 --> 00:54:10,270
possibility at all is

1494
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:12,400
working remotely i think many employers

1495
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,299
have recognized it and are

1496
00:54:16,299 --> 00:54:18,430
slowly approaching the end  our group but

1497
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:21,359
i still have two questions that i would like to

1498
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,770
get rid of a group that are aimed at

1499
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:25,480
each other  especially to the projects but

1500
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,990
definitely also to you with marco and that

1501
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:30,490
is

1502
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:33,619
because maybe one or the other out there has it now oh yes

1503
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:35,570
I would actually like

1504
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:37,790
to do a project like that and since we are now

1505
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:39,220


1506
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:42,619
asking what would be your wheel turn  group says

1507
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:45,170
we also want to do something from

1508
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:46,520
this spectrum that we have heard

1509
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,930
or just a completely new idea

1510
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:50,530
but somehow related to it

1511
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:53,750
what should you consider early on maybe

1512
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:56,660
tackle do you have

1513
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,040
any recommendations or

1514
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,950
warnings for people who say okay

1515
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,270
maybe we are one  group we want to do

1516
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:04,880
something, what would you like to say on the

1517
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,890
way,

1518
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:09,560
so I think what is good is

1519
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,440
that you first think about what

1520
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,110
you want to do and then look for the place instead of the

1521
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:17,360
other way around, so

1522
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,130
most people do it the other way around and then you fall in

1523
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:20,710
love  in some object and then

1524
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:23,420
somehow it's totally difficult to

1525
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,730
do something meaningful with it and

1526
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:28,190
you notice that it is very difficult to

1527
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:31,010
control this building and

1528
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:33,440
also to think about it we have now

1529
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,200
said several times how long these

1530
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,280
planning processes are now with you

1531
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,190
then back then that you have been there for 14 years

1532
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:43,310
or something like that and

1533
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:45,320
you have to bridge this time somehow so that

1534
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,570
it costs money to build but if you

1535
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:49,850
somehow you have to if you can then

1536
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,080
maybe have a business model behind

1537
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,550
it you have to assume it will

1538
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,050
take four years or three

1539
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,780
until the first euro rolls back

1540
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,490
and to bridge this time that you can

1541
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:01,609
do that  realistically that would be

1542
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:02,830
my tip

1543
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:04,880
exactly i would probably then go in a really

1544
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,830
similar direction

1545
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:09,140
we always have that when i introduced our group of young

1546
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,880
people i heard it very often

1547
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,740
how the group

1548
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,720
existed before he got the

1549
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,720
property he wanted to buy and  I think

1550
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,250
it's really something that a lot of

1551
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,720
groups start with somewhere

1552
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,460
individually  A group of people or a very small

1553
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,930
group saw something cool somewhere in the area

1554
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:25,460
and

1555
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,810
then try to build around it as a group. It was the other way around

1556
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:28,250
for us.

1557
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:31,269
We worked together as a group for a

1558
00:56:31,269 --> 00:56:33,369
very, very long

1559
00:56:33,369 --> 00:56:35,169
time. At the beginning

1560
00:56:35,169 --> 00:56:37,179
, we knew  that it works we

1561
00:56:37,179 --> 00:56:39,609
then somehow started to

1562
00:56:39,609 --> 00:56:41,499
say okay we are now looking at

1563
00:56:41,499 --> 00:56:44,019
plots of land and hopefully have now

1564
00:56:44,019 --> 00:56:45,519
found something suitable for us

1565
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:47,709
which I also feel really really good so far

1566
00:56:47,709 --> 00:56:50,519


1567
00:56:52,769 --> 00:56:54,880
in January also

1568
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,679
underlined again that we

1569
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:59,559
tried to do that  to make up for the fact that

1570
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:01,149
we thought so big right from the start

1571
00:57:01,149 --> 00:57:03,219
we said we really

1572
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,289
don't try because we somehow think that

1573
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:06,729
it absolutely needs this size per se

1574
00:57:06,729 --> 00:57:08,099
but

1575
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:10,709
exactly to overcome this long

1576
00:57:10,709 --> 00:57:12,789
drought phase or frustration phase that's when we

1577
00:57:12,789 --> 00:57:13,839
finally

1578
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:16,089
really get going time helps  look

1579
00:57:16,089 --> 00:57:18,130
if you are as broad as possible

1580
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:20,019
because otherwise  must have seen quite often in

1581
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:21,579
this research phase in the years

1582
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:23,289
before is that is

1583
00:57:23,289 --> 00:57:24,729
smaller circles of friends who

1584
00:57:24,729 --> 00:57:27,039
tried to do something like that and then there

1585
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,140
were often the expectations that

1586
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,099
we somehow distribute the work

1587
00:57:30,099 --> 00:57:32,079
equally and it never worked, that

1588
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:33,219
was always the case  in the end, somehow, a

1589
00:57:33,219 --> 00:57:34,479
few people who carried the whole

1590
00:57:34,479 --> 00:57:35,799
burden and often broke down at some

1591
00:57:35,799 --> 00:57:37,059
point because it's just too

1592
00:57:37,059 --> 00:57:39,999
much and we

1593
00:57:39,999 --> 00:57:41,859
're already experiencing that in parts with golf, although

1594
00:57:41,859 --> 00:57:43,239
we didn't

1595
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:44,409
expect it to take so long

1596
00:57:44,409 --> 00:57:46,869
phase so frustrating for us too,

1597
00:57:46,869 --> 00:57:49,149
but we can now really

1598
00:57:49,149 --> 00:57:51,279
fall back on 80 people who can support us

1599
00:57:51,279 --> 00:57:52,659
, whether this is somehow moderation,

1600
00:57:52,659 --> 00:57:54,099
preparation of the workshops or

1601
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:55,419
whether the questions are actually about the content

1602
00:57:55,419 --> 00:57:57,909
, it's really crazy,

1603
00:57:57,909 --> 00:57:59,229
I think even if we are only

1604
00:57:59,229 --> 00:58:00,849
half as many  if we had been we might not have had

1605
00:58:00,849 --> 00:58:02,979
this long

1606
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,509
phase  ht survived because it's just really

1607
00:58:04,509 --> 00:58:06,369
too much for a few shoulders

1608
00:58:06,369 --> 00:58:07,559
and

1609
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:09,819
from a political point of view

1610
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,799
there is also something you can say

1611
00:58:11,799 --> 00:58:13,630
okay these are recommendations warning he

1612
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:14,919
told me early on

1613
00:58:14,919 --> 00:58:18,538
we'll talk to the mayor we've heard

1614
00:58:18,989 --> 00:58:22,419
that  but knows all the

1615
00:58:22,419 --> 00:58:24,549
reservations of the rural population,

1616
00:58:24,549 --> 00:58:27,099
so to speak, you shouldn’t serve them

1617
00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:29,289
that was so nice we had a

1618
00:58:29,289 --> 00:58:31,569
zdf contribution there was also a hint

1619
00:58:31,569 --> 00:58:33,789
from someone from cologne that you shouldn’t let that hang out in

1620
00:58:33,789 --> 00:58:35,019
any case

1621
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:36,939
, but the people here before  place

1622
00:58:36,939 --> 00:58:38,849
are already in order

1623
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,580
and that's true too, so

1624
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:43,970
now i recently had the discussion

1625
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:46,620
why are you doing the building areas like

1626
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:47,760
I said we are now writing again

1627
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,060
from a cooperative

1628
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,380
the seals in rural areas

1629
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,870
the seals yes where I think are

1630
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:57,030
from a municipality  now of two

1631
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:59,300
120 square kilometers three

1632
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,020
square kilometers only

1633
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:04,080
sealed 70 percent wide because e  it's always

1634
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,700
about we we have to plant trees

1635
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,440
yes where i always say we have

1636
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,670


1637
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:09,870


1638
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:11,820


1639
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:14,640
planted so many trees here in the last decades as compensatory and replacement measures for the city and became a community when

1640
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,960
we did that on our

1641
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,760
property after five years  also

1642
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,350
obliged to take them over, that means

1643
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:21,150
they are now in our inventory they

1644
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:23,670
cost us several 10,000 euros a

1645
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:26,160
year to maintain and care for them

1646
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,890
this tree care yes and we have

1647
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:30,090
less money every year but due to the number of

1648
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:31,830
residents but increasing fixed costs

1649
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:34,020
due to the trees the  we have he

1650
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:36,990
is coming here the people are

1651
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,460
coming and say you have to plant more

1652
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:42,270
trees and more electricity needs to be

1653
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:44,520


1654
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,920
produced we are currently producing we

1655
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,540
are not finished here we will have enough

1656
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:51,630
space 300 from the electricity  we ourselves

1657
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:54,870
consume so and now a few of the

1658
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:56,780
representatives of e asked up until

1659
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:59,010
then well how does d  ann

1660
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:01,400
from kleinmachnow it's the berlin bacon belt they

1661
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,530
produce two percent of their

1662
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:07,590
own electricity a year so and berlin

1663
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:09,240
it won't look any different, even

1664
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,970
worse that means

1665
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:13,230


1666
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:15,780
pulling out this expectation here and saying you still have to do this

1667
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,880
and more solar cells have to be on

1668
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,430
the roofs  announcement we have

1669
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:22,680
historic village centers and we have

1670
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,240
now, for example as a municipality,

1671
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,070
leased the castle tower for the next few

1672
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:28,680
decades and i would now like to avoid

1673
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,600
having to look at the historic village

1674
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:34,530
and everywhere the solar panels reflect

1675
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:37,590
the picture that wants to be shot, so

1676
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:38,670
you should at least in the historic village

1677
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:42,630
center  admit that we also

1678
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:44,730
try to control that there, that we also

1679
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:46,880
want to preserve the historical and

1680
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,640
therefore my tip you should just

1681
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,500
get to know the people before you use

1682
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,470
the drawers because once you have

1683
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:57,060
landed a drawer it is

1684
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:59,340
quite difficult to get out of there  come and

1685
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,840
help, of course, such a sac

1686
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,450
hey open day here or just

1687
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:06,240
invite people that

1688
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,640
no fences are put

1689
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,210
up yes our people actually

1690
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:14,370
do that and that you simply

1691
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,530
welcome each other with a positive basic mood

1692
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:17,940
that i think would be important because

1693
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:20,250
what we have been through here  have in the region

1694
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,240
i have my origins from the

1695
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,680
prignitz the even worse it like the

1696
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,480
uckermark

1697
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,490
is the decline of local

1698
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:28,830
production and what we could be able to do here now,

1699
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:30,960


1700
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,790
for example, or coal on

1701
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,230
coconut, is that

1702
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:35,940
jobs will be created again or  they were

1703
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,680
even created in cocoon and

1704
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,200
that's exactly what we want and that's only possible

1705
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,430
together,

1706
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:42,720
not that you make each other up

1707
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,260
somehow, but

1708
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:47,730
that you're just open and we

1709
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:50,720
're also for renewable energies but

1710
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,470
just an example we have

1711
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:55,020
five now  large biogas plants

1712
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:56,400
truck traffic for this

1713
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,110
biogas plant alone must g  Being filled

1714
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:00,180
has increased tenfold in some villages

1715
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,300


1716
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,710
and that's why you should

1717
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:07,250
be careful what you ask

1718
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:10,170
, especially what's going in

1719
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:13,050
that direction, then the people are

1720
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:15,570
already open, they have

1721
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:17,100
withdrawn a lot and have also

1722
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,700
sacrificed a lot in terms of identity  and

1723
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,410
now you have to give something back somehow and

1724
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:24,240
you do that by opening up

1725
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,460
and creating spaces that can also be used by

1726
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:28,440
those cafés

1727
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:32,060
or offers to meet again

1728
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:36,030
thank you very much we are now at the end of

1729
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:39,180
our time i would like to thank you

1730
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,040
again  Thank you all four

1731
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,080
for the really interesting contributions

1732
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,610
and the exciting discussion

1733
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:49,860
and I would rather think the

1734
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:52,080
image that was conveyed here is

1735
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,330
quite clear

1736
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:57,819
there are some things that can be formulated so nicely

1737
01:02:57,819 --> 01:02:59,709
I think there is also potential

1738
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:02,259
for other groups and as you can see  how

1739
01:03:02,259 --> 01:03:04,059
fast it can suddenly

1740
01:03:04,059 --> 01:03:05,680
happen when one starts then the others come

1741
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,130
because you can see it's possible, but

1742
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:10,690
it's also important

1743
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:12,549
to have the support of politicians who are

1744
01:03:12,549 --> 01:03:14,650
open to it, that makes

1745
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:19,829
things a lot easier and that's the end of it

1746
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:23,469
and yes, I would also like to thank all

1747
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:25,979
our current and future

1748
01:03:25,979 --> 01:03:27,999
viewers who are watching the  Watch recording sun

1749
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:30,539
and

1750
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:32,680
hope you

1751
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:35,650
keep dreaming about our channel and I think

1752
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:37,680
we won't continue until tomorrow

1753
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,529
exactly then in the afternoon

1754
01:03:40,529 --> 01:03:44,469
just look at the timetable point alte -

1755
01:03:44,469 --> 01:03:48,819
halle.de and yes, have

1756
01:03:48,819 --> 01:03:51,489
a nice evening to all of you and to you too

1757
01:03:51,489 --> 01:03:52,719
thank you again that made me very

1758
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:55,079
