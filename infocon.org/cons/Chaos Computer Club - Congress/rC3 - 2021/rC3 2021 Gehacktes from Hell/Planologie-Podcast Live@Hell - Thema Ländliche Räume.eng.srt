development, especially

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,340
urban development spatially

00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,230
explain and

13
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,329
comment on effective planning or simply leave

topics that

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,410
interest you and what you learn

00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,219
here today live at rc 3 in the channel

20
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,739
hacked from hell  our studio

21
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:55,989
is located in a rural

22
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,460
area in the old hall in the middle of

23
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,680
brandenburg we are very excited

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,629
about today's podcast, which is about the

25
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:04,809
rural area at the end of the podcast there

26
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:08,200
will be an opportunity for questions from

27
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,470
the internet and from home  from

28
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,150
the devices you can the fra

29
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,570
gen post via twitter with the hashtag rc3

30
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,920
hell or in the café or rocket chat under

34
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,330
thanks green yesterday there was

35
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,310
already a discussion with

36
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,430
the mayor of wiesenburg and

37
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,720
representatives of the old hall  and two

38
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,570
other local projects that dealt with

39
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,950
concrete development

40
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,020
approaches from wiesenburg and bad belzig and today

41
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,310
we want to

42
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,380
pick something out again and look at the subject of rural areas with a little more distance

43
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,270
and the glasses of science

44
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,299
and

45
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:54,340
we will be

46
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,170
talking about rural development  talk and how this was

47
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,689
controlled via the

48
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:00,399
media depiction that kong is going and

49
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,470
staying in rural areas, about the

50
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,170
resources he costs us and the

51
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,570
inheritance and the innovative

52
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,878
strength that he has in the apartment and through this

53
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:12,609
carpet of topics, doctor ariane helps me today

54
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:15,830
as  background, among

55
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,600
other things, the study of the city and

56
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,610
region  alplanning at the tu berlin a

57
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,320
doctorate on deceleration in small

58
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,080
and medium-sized towns and has been a

59
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,610
researcher at the leibniz institute for

60
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,400
spatial social research since 2008 short rs

61
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,850
hello ariane hello laura

62
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,830
because we have to record

63
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,750
an episode on the subject of rural areas in this podcast for the first time

64
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,120
, of course we have to  first of

65
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,730
all, ask the question how is it

66
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,930
actually defined by science

67
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,780
what is it that we are

68
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,910
talking about you are starting with a

69
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,060
huge question and i will allow

70
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,030
myself to go back a bit in

71
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,340
history when we are talking about

72
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,830
rural areas  and you will

73
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,660
notice i say rural areas not

74
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,830
rural areas more on that later

75
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,990
then we have to think about it first

76
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,370
okay with the

77
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,140
industrialization a

78
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,820
huge urbanization has actually also started

79
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,430
and town and country were

80
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,280
relatively clearly distinguishable

81
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,030
and essentially you can do it on the basis of three

82
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,260
I'm going to name categories now at

83
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,330
unterschi  edene the settlement structure the

84
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,230
economic structure and the

85
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,180
social structure the settlement structure

86
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,490
rural areas are where villages and 17

87
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,110
young and scattered settlements are the

88
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,580
economic structure rural areas are

89
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,900
where agriculture, forestry

90
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,060
and mining happens and the

91
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,270
social structure is far less

92
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,410
differentiated than that in the city

93
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,560
or in the cities  at that time it

94
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,700


95
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,500
actually changed a bit, especially after the second world war

96
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,590
and was more and more

97
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,320
translated into a rural area is

98
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,870
backward and has to adapt to the city

99
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,360
and be developed

100
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,770
people are leaving the rural areas

101
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,320
because of agriculture and

102
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,760
forestry  brings in far less money

103
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,010
and so on and

104
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,200
when we talk about rural areas today, the whole thing has

105
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,590


106
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,880


107
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,100
actually developed into very differentiated categorization or attempts at categorization

108
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,680
and in Germany we have tried

109
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,540
if it’s really about that  h the

110
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,670
clear definition is then already

111
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,250
this clear definition is totally unclear because

112
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,930
depending on what you are referring to,

113
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,670
35 to 95 percent of the area of

114
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,300
germany is

115
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,050
finite or 15 to 60 percent of the

116
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,200
inhabitants in rural areas probably the

117
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,850
best known and perhaps

118
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,530
differentiated the model that

119
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,400
from  könig sie tut you can read about in the state atlas

120
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,800
and that’s where the idea is actually

121
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,870
kiel finally you can primarily get an idea of the

122
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,750
settlement

123
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,680
structure it’s about the settlement

124
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,740
density proportion of one- and two-family houses

125
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,970
which usually goes hand in hand with the fact that there is

126
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,310
far less rental living space but

127
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,040
also not  existing

128
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,340
settlements outside of the settlement area

129
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,200
and you then have again and again

130
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,700
different so you differentiate between four

131
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,160
categories of rurality in

132
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,750
terms of rurality you differentiate between very

133
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,050
rural and more rural and then you

134
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,169
differentiate between

135
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:21,040
socio-economically strong and so

136
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,260
economically less strong that's what it means,

137
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,169
so to speak  model of four out of

138
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:28,840
five you with four areas, which i also

139
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,570
distributed more or less equally and you then

140
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,760
come to the thünen institute

141
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,740
according to this categorization, there would

142
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,220
actually be 47 million people in the

143
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,210
german population in rural areas

144
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,130
where there are 57 percent of the

145
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,080
population but there are also  there are

146
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,250
others but that should

147
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,669
suffice for now i think

148
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:50,530
that means there are you said there are

149
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,140
a number of areas what

150
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,910
regional differences are there

151
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,650
between the rural areas

152
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,780
that is essentially so if

153
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,700
we can stick to the tones categories

154
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,479
we can  on the one hand, there is also a difference between being

155
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,130
too economically strong and

156
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,380
socio-economically weak, which is relative,

157
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,610
so if we look at the

158
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,180
map of germany and

159
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,680
want to present it very strikingly, then

160
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,930
we can actually say that

161
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,669
rural areas in eastern

162
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,570
germany the more peripheral they are, the

163
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,800
socio-economically weaker they are usually found

164
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,479
at the same time  we such ra  ume

165
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:27,370
but also, for example, in the east of

166
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,900
bavaria on the czech border in the

167
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,360
bavarian forest and that the extreme

168
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,180
antithesis to this are mainly rural

169
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,830
areas in southern germany they are also

170
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,050
very sparsely populated they are also mountains

171
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,880
but there are mainly something

172
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,640
like so-called hidden champions  so to

173
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,610


174
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,780
speak, the world market leader with some kind of products, yes, I sometimes

175
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,490
got to know a company that

176
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,660
fills some water

177
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,340
and manufactures mobile water filter systems, and thus the

178
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,260
olympic village in beijing nobody knows about this

179
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,660
company,

180
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,070
but the turnover is huge,

181
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,680
somewhere in the deepest part of bavaria and it's mega

182
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,630
successful  yes, we find that a

183
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,850
lot of rural areas and another

184
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,560
point is of course tourism,

185
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,790
so a lot of rural areas are of

186
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,160
course too economically

187
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,770
strong because they

188
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,050
have a lot of tourism and simply combine winter and

189
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,760
summer tourism in one

190
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,710
sales generation, which is striking

191
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,110
to express and there  nn we still have

192
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,480
something like this he so there we have

193
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,280
regional differences, so to speak, yes east

194
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,110
west north south also find

195
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,390
very socio-

196
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,030
economically sensitive areas in northern Germany that is one

197
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,040
direction and then of course we

198
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,870
still have the type

199
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,630
categorization like this  more

200
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,550
rural is categorized namely these

201
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,630
are what I call

202
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,120
settlement structures areas that are rural

203
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,950
are villages rather than small

204
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,330
settlements because people

205
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,740
mostly live in one and two-family

206
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,360
houses but are in the

207
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,340
immediate vicinity of large cities

208
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,070
so there is a need on some axes

209
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,760
of berlin  you just know

210
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,980
yourself only 20 kilometers away says dudek so

211
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,500
hoops where am i here yeah but

212
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,210
actually

213
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,010
yeah it's kind of a rural area it

214
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,690
's kind of more rural because

215
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,470
maybe even the next

216
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,270
s-bahn connection is actually

217
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,180
almost within walking distance  would be and

218
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,250
so we have just ne giant in the other

219
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,900
ande  another difference is also

220
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,400
the type of agricultural use,

221
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,950
so in northern germany we are dealing with extensive agricultural use in

222
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,050
north-western germany or also

223
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,490
in north-eastern germany with one of

224
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,320
extensive agricultural use

225
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,849
, while in the hilly areas we also

226
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,289


227
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,640
have small-scale agriculture

228
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,929
but it also has a lot to do with the traditional

229
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,480
division of inheritance of land, i.e. the

230
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,370
agricultural type, there is

231
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,900
still agriculture, so even if

232
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,300
the proportion of those who

233
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,070
live and earn their living from it has decreased

234
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,140
, of course

235
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,010
, we still have agriculture in rural areas

236
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,330


237
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,850
characteristic and this also

238
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,310
varies depending on the region and then of

239
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,810
course there are differences in mentality

240
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,730
but that doesn't have so much

241
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,490
to do with the country it's also between

242
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,310
the cities so

243
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,900
you can find out which

244
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,490
numbers are used to

245
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,520
set up these models exactly  these are for  for

246
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,560
one thing it's economic,

247
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,240
i.e. socio-economic figures, it's about

248
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,740


249
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,320
unemployment, it's about average

250
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,560
income, but it's also about when

251
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,880
we look, for example, there's a really

252
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,710
nice map from the bbsr, it's about

253
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,440
growing and shrinking municipalities and

254
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,610
it's quite  interesting because

255
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,680
people believe that

256
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,420
a place is growing very quickly if more people move

257
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,589
and shrink that would mean people

258
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:41,300
leaving the model is a bit

259
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,850
more complex because, among other things, the

260
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,350
commuters in and out of the valley are also

261
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,040
taken into account and the guns, the trade tax revenue, i.e.

262
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,150
me  can lose residents as a

263
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,339
municipality but

264
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:53,120
still have increasing

265
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,730
trade tax income it only helped

266
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,089
because 100 residents, so to speak,

267
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:00,890
went on the whistle I'm not

268
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,780
necessarily in a difficult situation

269
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,600
as a municipality that's one, so

270
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,180
this socio-economic

271
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,550
perspective another perspective on

272
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,080
the cards that of course  are important

273
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,420
are age-average  Hschnitt because

274
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,890
we are primarily looking into the future and

275
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,110
we see

276
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,990
a very high average age in many rural areas, so

277
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,700
I just looked again at the

278
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,790
spatial planning report for 2021

279
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,920
and there they still assume

280
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,740
that there are rural areas where  you in

281
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,280
the next 15 years

282
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,930
26%

283
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,380
population decline is somehow a

284
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,660
stupid word

285
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,920
the crash budget there is this beautiful

286
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,600
Italian word so the population

287
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,020
will decrease by about 26 percent

288
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,070
simply because the

289
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,360
average age is so high and

290
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,860
people of old age

291
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,320
die  and many young people have left

292
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,650
yes and these are sort of numbers

293
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,209
that you can use to measure it, of

294
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:57,220
course there are also

295
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,780
what I said earlier, so the

296
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,910
proportion of single-family houses but also the

297
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,410
proportion of two-family houses you can also ask the other way around

298
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,120
how much and how high

299
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,680
is the proportion of rented apartments  or

300
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,290
even in rental properties because that's

301
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,970
something we do in ländli  in

302
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,860
many rural areas not at all and

303
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,540
in other rural areas only very

304
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,120
little which is also a problem

305
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,340
because younger people in particular

306
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,200
don’t like not everyone buy a house at 20

307
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,420


308
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,210
these are the numbers, so to speak, then there

309
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,900
is still this access from

310
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,310
its what i perceive as a rural

311
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,650
area that's a really, really

312
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,860
soft factor

313
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,570
you know that even if you kind of go

314
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,550
for a walk in big cities and then

315
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,440
it's kind of green or you meet three

316
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,030
people you know and then you say oh

317
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,670
that's right  like in the village so this

318
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,010
sense of village of

319
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,700
manageability of you know each other

320
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,860
is of course also an indicator for

321
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,220
ruralness and a last point what

322
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,720
often happens which i don't

323
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,120
support but you don't always have a

324
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,160
better solution often rural areas are like

325
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,870
that  a bit of the rest of the space so

326
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,020
we'll see what it is instead of what it is urban

327
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,520
and everything else is then somehow

328
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,760
rural

329
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,060
what are the g  Large observed

330
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,840
development trends in the last

331
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,520
two decades over the entire area

332
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,710
in Germany and especially

333
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,680
now before the fire are in Brandenburg

334
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,090
the rural area as water

335
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,440
has moved quite a lot

336
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,180
so the last two three decades 6

337
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,900
or 12 decades

338
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,130
we are still tending to live in the age

339
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,170
of urbanization since

340
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,610
industrialization i

341
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,350
actually said before that

342
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,190
after the fall of the wall

343
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,470
, especially around berlin, first of all

344
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,790
we actually experienced two things at the

345
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,460
same time we have on the one hand a

346
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,110
so-called catch-up  great barney

347
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,300
experienced so balization is

348
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,890
not necessarily a

349
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,440
rural area per se so people move from

350
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,680
the big cities to the surrounding areas in berlin

351
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,420
you could see it very nicely in the early and

352
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,460
mid 90s

353
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,720
i think annette

354
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,179
spellerberg it was the in  made a

355
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:17,219
study in the 90s where they  lin somehow represented as a

356
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:19,649
cake with snappy pieces

357
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:22,349
and showed well you

358
00:13:22,349 --> 00:13:25,199
move if you live in hellersdorf then

359
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:27,029
you just move to

360
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:30,059
altlandsberg neuhagen fredersdorf but if you live in

361
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,189
zehlendorf and then you just move to

362
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:34,009
kleinmachnow teltow

363
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:36,479
or whatever from pankow to

364
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:38,729
oranienburg  bernau and so on, so

365
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:40,409
to speak, that this privatization in

366
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:42,779
Berlin really always works along

367
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,029
the axes that

368
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:49,039
was also very visible in the early to

369
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:51,389
actually until the end of the

370
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:52,829
90s if you look at the migration

371
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:55,249
figures you can see

372
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:58,139
very high relocations  rate from the city of

373
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,659
berlin to the surrounding area you can see the extremely

374
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:03,679
high rate of new construction in the surrounding communities

375
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,919
, especially those with an s-bahn connection, and

376
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,309
at the same time there was a large emigration in rural areas,

377
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,769
but also

378
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,689
in small and medium-sized towns in general in east germany

379
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:16,979
, especially from  the young

380
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:20,539
generation and especially women

381
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:24,089
who either really  h immediately

382
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:26,459
after school for training studies

383
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:29,009
etc. mainly in the big cities, especially

384
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:31,199
in the west german big cities but

385
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,519
also to berlin sometimes a little

386
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,839
later also leipzig and dresden

387
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,119
but a little less

388
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:37,769
and on the other hand also a

389
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:39,989
generation yours

390
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:41,639
maybe already had training but

391
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,619
was still young enough to

392
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:45,089
start something new but maybe

393
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:46,709
even experienced unemployment for the first

394
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:49,589
time yes that was, so to speak, there was such

395
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,529
a huge departure from, above all,

396
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:53,969
the rural areas of the small and

397
00:14:53,969 --> 00:14:55,559
medium-sized towns  also a lot to do with

398
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:57,749
industrial structural change and so

399
00:14:57,749 --> 00:15:00,899
on and so forth and we see

400
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:06,209
until about 97 98 we see if we

401
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:08,489
just look at berlin

402
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:10,919
brandenburg we see people moving away from berlin and

403
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:13,199
then moving to brandenburg if we look a few

404
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,059
years later  we are increasingly

405
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:17,659
more, especially in the state of Brandenburg,

406
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,829
actually only one move and

407
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:24,359
you  this trend will continue until 2010 and from

408
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:26,309
2010 there is an incredibly beautiful

409
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:28,380
curve you really like to show

410
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,210
actually should bring with you from the state

411
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,030
statistical office from 2010

412
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,190
we will again

413
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,440
see cautious immigration or

414
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,450
emigration from the city of berlin to the

415
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,570
surrounding area and from 2014 we will even see it  for the

416
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,030
first time an immigration into

417
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,580
the so-called distant metropolises

418
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,920
so here for example wiesenburg who

419
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,530
metropolises distant space

420
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,940
essentially we can say metropolises for

421
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,440
a space is everything that not only

422
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,110
the s-bahn goes to we see

423
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,840
when we look at the numbers  look

424
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,130
at last year we had a

425
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,970
negative migration balance in berlin for the first time

426
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,830
and the migration balance and brandenburg

427
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,260
was higher than it has ever been since the reunification

428
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,850
i find the figures from 2020 a

429
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,350
bit difficult because we had no

430
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,540
immigration from abroad so use with

431
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,550
caution but  the trend was

432
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,620
already there, so to speak, that's one thing and the

433
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,530
other what we are  see in the state of brandenburg

434
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,530
and that's the personal anecdote

435
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,580
i come from the state of brandenburg

436
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,440
from the ford of my own liking but it

437
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,500
doesn't matter and i've always printed around like this for years and i

438
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,240


439
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,070
come from berlin actually

440
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,500
i'm actually a trainer i  for god's

441
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,850
sake I wouldn't have said that I'm from

442
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,890
brandenburg so that's just

443
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,390
highly embarrassing and terribly

444
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,220
terrible

445
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,370
and so for 56 years I've been observing in

446
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,560
myself that I say yes

447
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,880
I'm from brandenburg doesn't have to

448
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,320
be discussed at all yes that's a

449
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,720
fact and i observe that with

450
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,520
others too and i think that has a

451
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,290
lot to do with the fact that a lot

452
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,030
has happened a lot has happened

453
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,840
since the year 2000 in terms of

454
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,560
civil society work in the state of brandenburg

455
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,660


456
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,640
via the action alliance over quite so

457
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,099
also on too too

458
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,740
but from a political point of view there are nine I would

459
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,300
almost say a new drive is

460
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,060
increasing  Younger people are also coming to

461
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,949
Brandenburg with ideas that somehow

462
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:21,599
say let’s just do it, they

463
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,490
also form a network, I mean we’re here in

464
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,650
Wiesenburg,

465
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,089
three streets away, let me say in

466
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,490
small words that coconut is one of the

467
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,510
first rural co-working spaces

468
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,840
to win the tourism prize in 2019

469
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,270
immediately cooperated with the mayors of

470
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,490
bad belzig and wiesenburg and

471
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,340


472
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,600
somehow always

473
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,920
presented a kind of lighthouse there are others too

474
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,630
they are not the only ones but

475
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,450
things have changed a bit so the

476
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,340
mood has changed  in

477
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,690
brandenburg it has become a bit

478
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,030
more positive how come so

479
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,980
is it because political

480
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,540
strategies at federal, state

481
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,420
or regional level were good and

482
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,270
worked or does it come from

483
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,380
a completely different direction and it

484
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,850
comes from the people themselves

485
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,410
or because  there is something about the

486
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,360
people in the lifestyles si  e

487
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,920
want they want to have that i

488
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,690
think it has a little bit of

489
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,460
both on

490
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,260
the one hand i would say there was

491
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,450
a generational change in the

492
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,350
administrations and also in those

493
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,020
places where something happens yes in

494
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,370
economic development there are really

495
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,530
great players who somehow

496
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,520
also try to look very closely

497
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,720
then there is quite banally a bit

498
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,000
more money you just have to say it very clearly

499
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,570
we actually started in 2000 so

500
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,300
actually with the 2017 election campaign

501
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,010
we experienced a new level of attention

502
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,870
for rural areas in Germany

503
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,520
and there were even more

504
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,660
not perfect and

505
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,970
not only good ones but there was a

506
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,000
new type of funding policy and it

507
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,450
was used because you had

508
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,340
a few clever ideas you had

509
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,840
a few clever people at the right time

510
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,580
I had this demo kit

511
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,560
try something and at the same time and in

512
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,060
my opinion that has  after a lot

513
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,580
to do with berlin at the moment where and

514
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,810
that say yes  m for example the actors from the

515
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,370
network of places of the future or such people from

516
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,190
Brandenburg who work digitally

517
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,550
who keep saying

518
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,200
that space is getting scarce but in Brandenburg

519
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,150
there is just this space of prosperity

520
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,860
and I wanted to say to them

521
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,780
that what we are doing today we are sitting here

522
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,100
somehow  with a few people still a

523
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,170
hell of a lot of square meters and

524
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,790
a lot of cables can somehow be laid

525
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,500
out here and that's such an

526
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,870
attractiveness that was discovered a little a

527
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,270
little bit in apolda

528
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,060
a young student once said to me you

529
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,000
know ariane you could see my

530
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,890
very far  i'm not yet but you

531
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,590
could still occupy the houses in berlin in the 90s

532
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,780
and

533
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,460
do whatever you want in the big apartments they're

534
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,920
all gone we can only do it in the

535
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,560
country yes and to a certain extent you're

536
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,480
right about that so it  Of course, it's

537
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,780
also a bit of a search for spaces where

538
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,880
you can find a certain amount of freedom that you

539
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,760
can still afford,

540
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,990
no matter what  chzeit and that in turn in my opinion is

541
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,840
a new quality

542
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,430
because we have known for a long time that people

543
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,560
somehow move to the country to

544
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,230
somehow drop out there

545
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,240
to live alternatively to do their housing projects

546
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,100
that’s not really new at all but i

547
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,720
think the new thing is that  there is such an

548
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,700
opening for what is already there,

549
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,680
so that you say okay, we want to start a

550
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,180
new project here somehow, we

551
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,550
are somehow all digitally

552
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,620
creative, but we

553
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,940
actually don't want to just do it with our

554
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,100


555
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,420
own kind, we also want to piece the village communities together  far as

556
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,710
you like and we want to create a space here

557
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,240
where the clubs can

558
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,890
meet again and we want to introduce ourselves to

559
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,660
the mayor first

560
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,820
and we want to do something together somehow

561
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,290
, whatever that can look like

562
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,480
and there is of course a whole

563
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,970
lot of competence  back to the

564
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,620
rural areas that had migrated years ago

565
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,170
and now  but these are

566
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,300
people who have traveled the world

567
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,310
, yes, they studied,

568
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,260
maybe they lived in the usa or canada

569
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,030
or in france or wherever

570
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,440
and have experienced an awful lot and

571
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,360
then bring an incredible amount of know-how

572
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,420
with them, which then again as  knowledge is

573
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,010
simply fed in because

574
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,540
the problem is often not that there are no

575
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,610
funding programs or no money,

576
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,380
but the problem is often a

577
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,180
lack of competence, so if I

578
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,490
don't have any employees in my administration

579
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,990
who can

580
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,120
apply for these funds, I ca

581
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,040
n't either  but if I have a few

582
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,450
people, this comes we'll do it

583
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,070
somehow, I can somehow also

584
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,600
retrieve money and if I can and can withdraw money

585
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,800
, I can somehow also make a small

586
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,630
cross and so and that's just coming

587
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,250
together a bit, my

588
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,970
assessment is okay at the moment  So what I

589
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,080
understood right now is that, above

590
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,370
all, the local life and the

591
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,050
people  hen who will come soon definitely

592
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,640
want to live and want to use the resources

593
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,320
that are available here, very

594
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,420
important, but that also means that the

595
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,250
federal level and

596
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,050
the inner-state way provided the funds for this

597
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,000
or there was also a

598
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,400
narrowing of the level, exactly  I mean

599
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,650
that, yes, but I think all levels

600
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,930
are important, so I emphasize in

601
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:10,860
another research project that

602
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,580
we did, I

603
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,770
always emphasized the district level extremely, for example, why

604
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:17,340
because in a specific case in a

605
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,830
Brandenburg district there is a woman in

606
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,960
the district administration who  always

607
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,570
drives to the villages and sees what skills there are

608
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,880
and then says to the people

609
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,430
, 'man, don't you want to

610
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,050
take part in the village competition? that would

611
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,030
suit you, don't you have

612
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,620
to apply for animal funds? that fits with

613
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,780
the project and it needs something

614
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,960
always these interfaces

615
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,610
where everyone knows okay there is

616
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,800
someone i can talk to di  some person

617
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,100
comes or i can go there or you

618
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,200
know somehow the economic development of

619
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,700
the state of brandenburg is not

620
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,120
some kind of crooked troupe who are

621
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,680
somehow strong and with a tie as

622
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,630
special nice people who made my

623
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,100
fun event and

624
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,090
that's why i dare to go there

625
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,310
and sometimes  to ask

626
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,320
and in brandenburg they also tried

627
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,660
to create such structures and also

628
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,750
to promote

629
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,010
intermediaries between the

630
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,130
institutions at

631
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,720
least what all this is

632
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,800
not yet the ultimate wisdom

633
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,240
is another topic but i

634
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,720
think all levels are equally important that

635
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,310
was  what can be done even better in the

636
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,490
future we will come to that at the very end

637
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,190
i would

638
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:31,970
otherwise only continue with the question once you have been drinking

639
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,780
i.e. that we

640
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,380
now have a scientific

641
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,960
description

642
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,830


643
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,690
, so to speak, that of the rural area there are also completely different

644
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,070
descriptions, for example through  the

645
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,170
media as is  because the

646
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,450
media depiction of the rural area how

647
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,370
and how it works it is

648
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,760
great it is really great

649
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,140
my colleague did an analysis in the media a few years ago

650
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,140


651
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,240
and it was about becoming democratic and

652
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,890
could actually meet very precisely in

653
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,390
the media depiction  there is

654
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,340
actually only the rural area and it is

655
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,770
bleeding and the landscapes are

656
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,480
emptying and they should

657
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,460
all die and in general demographic

658
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,200
change is taking hold sometimes there is still

659
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,480
a bit of a shortage of skilled workers the

660
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,740
facility then there are only two

661
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,090
other directions there is a nice

662
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,100
job by  opel's first name is

663
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,980
christoph baumann the

664
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,100
rural idyll is hot i think he has

665
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,830
been analyzing films and magazines since the 1950s

666
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,870
and shows above

667
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:35,760
all that rural areas are often portrayed as

668
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,150
idylls that preserve tradition and customs

669
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,010
and are beautiful and

670
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,140
harmonious at the same time  brutal to

671
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,430
den Heimatfilm there's then  also the

672
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,410
wild brawls but somehow that's

673
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:49,440
the way it is this the rural idyll

674
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,940
we see it too that's one of the

675
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,410
most famous examples which is repeatedly

676
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,820
quoted the magazine

677
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,020
landlust is one of the highest-circulation

678
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,430
magazines in germany is

679
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,350
mainly read in stetten but

680
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:04,560
spreads exactly this idealized or

681
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,830
idyllic romanticized picture of

682
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,470
rural areas, as we know, we have had a

683
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,060
pandemic for almost two years

684
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,430
now and the media

685
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,530
reporting has almost

686
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,900
completely turned around, so it

687
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,920
started with the fact that in march 2020 there was

688
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,650


689
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,530
such an acute message that thousands of Parisians were

690
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,660
leaving  the city and flee to the

691
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,690
country in the country we are safe from

692
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,570
the virus the country dwellers do not want

693
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,910
the city dwellers because and so on

694
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,130
the virus is brought abroad he so we

695
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:44,160
suddenly have almost worldwide

696
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,140
paris was in the media london also

697
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,720
wells as a rural antithesis  but also

698
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,570
new york in germany almost e

699
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,270
His

700
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,730
escape to the country was somehow described in a little less as somehow sun, such a

701
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,040
pandemic escape,

702
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,570
and at the same time it fits

703
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,700
into a trend that was already there a bit

704
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,860
before, namely a

705
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,460
small rediscovery of people

706
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,050
who

707
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,030


708
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,970
are increasingly interested in country life again  back to the country and

709
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,500
started so last year

710
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,670
x or this year i

711
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:20,030
looked at ten major

712
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,450
german-language newspapers all the articles

713
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,470
that had something

714
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,060
to do with country life village life city escape and so on there

715
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,300
were somehow 135 in one year

716
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,760
from march to  march and there are actually

717
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:39,260
three big topics the first topic in the

718
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,960
last or in this period of time was

719
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,840
well well in rural areas you have to be in

720
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,370
safer form that's not true at

721
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,200
all we know that when we look at the

722
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,510
maps of the institutes we see that

723
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,890
very clearly  it's not true

724
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,660
but somehow it got burned in that

725
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,160
go  t along with such personal

726
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,060
stories from us too, so when

727
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,980
residents in sohland are

728
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,270
interviewed, one hasn’t changed that much for us either

729
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,710
, i’m always just at

730
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,900
home and actually excited

731
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,010
i don’t bother me i have to put

732
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:09,950
on a mask in the supermarket the second

733
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,340
the direction is the whole topic of home

734
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,130
office and location-independent

735
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:19,220
working we already know that from before so

736
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,310
i interviewed 10 mayor in the

737
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,590
north of brandenburg in 2009

738
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,530
said the home office is the

739
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,560
future for us villages if people

740
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,210
no longer work in an office

741
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,740
then you can also sit here with me

742
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,260
in the small village and can

743
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,940
work just as well from here and bring the

744
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,760
work with you to the village, so that was,

745
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,610
so to speak, and there was definitely

746
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,710
a big issue for some people with the

747
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:48,500
pandemic and the widening of

748
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,750
the  home office basis is what I call it now,

749
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,210
does the muscle have experience of home

750
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,040
office but the topic is still m  al has become a bit more

751
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,510
present and has

752
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,120
crept into this discourse about

753
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,180
living in the country meanwhile and that's

754
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,710
interesting then suddenly the

755
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:07,370
media discourse seems as if there had never been

756
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,620
any other reason to live in the city

757
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,960
apart from work and if you

758
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,700
have the  work that

759
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,870
can be done at a distance one can often live

760
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,160
in the country so suddenly it appears in the media

761
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,870
as if everyone had always wanted to live in the

762
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,880
country and then 1000

763
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,620
studies are quoted where

764
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,090
somehow a third of the

765
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,800
people are fine  imagine living in the

766
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,150
country more than

767
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,670
a third lived there yes well how a

768
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,070
bit funny like that and the third point

769
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,810
and that is actually interesting and also

770
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,640
a bit worrying

771
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,130
because whoever from Great Britain can do that is an

772
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,470
increasing price of real estate

773
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,510
in rural areas  of

774
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,780
course it's about people who are new

775
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,580
or move back many then it

776
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,860
will also be w  always going back because they

777
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,820
might move back to where they came from,

778
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,430
even in old age, sometimes after the end of their

779
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,760
active working life,

780
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,260
exactly so that real estate is

781
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,320
becoming more expensive, that is also very often very

782
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,620
alarmist, because of course the

783
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,120
rate of inflation is very high in a very short time

784
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,400
, yes, if I

785
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,480
were to  after all, there is always a comparison between somehow

786
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,950


787
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,630
different areas between the

788
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,240
big city and the rural area and

789
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,860
then it says somehow in the

790
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,690
big cities the real estate

791
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,130
prices have risen by eight percent and in the

792
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,540
rural areas and 12 or

793
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,030
whatever some numbers will then

794
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,100


795
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,570
so to speak, and you always realize that the increase in rural

796
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,160
areas is higher, well, you

797
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,330
also came from a lower

798
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,310
level, but that is actually a

799
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,470
trend that we have already seen,

800
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,080
but there is also a parallel

801
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,500
trend in it, namely the  but increasingly

802
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,000
I know unfortunately still no good

803
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,920
u  investigations into this but the increasingly

804
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,940
intensified search for a

805
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,770
second home that's unfortunately something

806
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,170
that means unfortunately unfortunately forgets about

807
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,750
that's something that we from france

808
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,660
great britain but also italy you

809
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,250
recognize and germany what what

810
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,570
actually always more the german or

811
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:59,720
the allotment garden so and  what is

812
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,740
there to it, of course, but those are,

813
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,540
so to speak, the three topics that suddenly

814
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,000
dominated reporting on rural areas this year and last year

815
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,670


816
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,390
, yes, but they are the

817
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,650
trolls, suddenly everyone was living there,

818
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,110
what does that do to the room, so

819
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,970
it is now  bad for the room should

820
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,620
the media check their facts

821
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,740
how do you rate that so what are we doing

822
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,510
now that the media will be like that and

823
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,120
well it is yes it is not like

824
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,830
that really wrong facts are being presented that

825
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,210
would be that would be yes it is true  yes

826
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,400
, not again,

827
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,200
it's just very often just too

828
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,850
short or sometimes

829
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,820
a sore thing is done  erbar an article in

830
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,670
the frankfurter rundschau

831
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:44,260
looked at the real estate

832
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,720
prices based on the postbank residential atlas this

833
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,930
article was published in november 2020 and

834
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,790
conveyed without really saying it,

835
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,530
but it conveyed the impression that

836
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,920


837
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,720
real estate

838
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,610
prices had risen so much due to the pandemic and then I thought to myself

839
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,320
very interesting that in

840
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,630
november the numbers for 2020 somehow

841
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,790
throw him look in the postbank residential

842
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,740
atlas and it comes to the postbank

843
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,450
that he was qualified there

844
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,510
had dealt with the price developments in

845
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,980
2009/10 so we are

846
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,450
all dealing with one  to do development that took place

847
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,250
completely without a pandemic

848
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,900
but apparently it seemed to fit quite

849
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,179
well with the pandemic narrative

850
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:23,770
that's why the fact is not wrong

851
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,559
the fact is right but the context is

852
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,830
somehow a bit so convoluted

853
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,150
that a wrong impression is created i

854
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,540
think that's the end of it  not

855
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,540
so highly dramatic I  in the last

856
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,970
year I met many people in rural

857
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,620
areas who said

858
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,660
we are happy we are happy that more

859
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,030
is being reported about us and that we are not

860
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:46,890
just

861
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,690
the dying villages and the empty

862
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,750
landscapes and the stupid farmers of

863
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,880
course the current reporting

864
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,290
is on again  bit difficult

865
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,950
but there is a certain amount of attention

866
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,960
that is mostly

867
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,770
very positive so that has a positive connotation

868
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,330
and there is also hope from local

869
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:10,090
actors if we ever

870
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,610
have media reporting because

871
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,980
it might be easier

872
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,960
to focus on our

873
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,630
specific  to

874
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,370
draw attention to problem situations and challenges

875
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,830
but it remains the same as an observer, yes,

876
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,510
from my perspective, namely that

877
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,750
with a certain amount of amusement, it was

878
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,179
and finds it just totally exciting

879
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:35,920
and can only try to achieve it, so

880
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,860


881
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,540
now i have learned that a lot of

882
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,830
people  now just want to pull out

883
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,080


884
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,180
u  And in the discussion with a couple of

885
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:50,770
city maps in advance of this

886
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:54,050
episode, I have a few things that one

887
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,520
could address and one of them

888
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,630
was definitely that we actually take the work assignment with us

889
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,360
in our training

890
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,780
to plan sustainably and

891
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,800
to carry out spatial development in a resource-saving

892
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,840
manner  and there is somehow

893
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,690
this assumption that

894
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,580
rural areas are definitely not resource-efficient

895
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,490
so the question for you who lives more

896
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,380
resource-efficiently the cities or

897
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,600
the inhabitants of rural areas great

898
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,570
question i think the assumption you are

899
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,810
describing has something to do with a book by

900
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,940
edward leser  from 2011 with the title

901
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,060
triumph of the city i claim to do

902
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,040
as an urban planning student i

903
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,840
was myself one reads this

904
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,420
and that poor and edward leser has just

905
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,980
shown for the usa that

906
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,380
people in rural areas use

907
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,640
far more

908
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,710
resources in the  there are essentially two arguments for this

909
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,110
they inhabit a larger  e

910
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,790
living space, in other words, you need more

911
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,740
energy to heat this living space,

912
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,470
to manage it, to maintain it and

913
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,710
so on just to build

914
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,620
and secondly,

915
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,940
people in rural areas drive more cars.

916
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,700


917
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,980
Both of these are definitely true in

918
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,780
Germany too

919
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,730


920
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,020
look at the average living space in

921
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,159
germany, which is

922
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,900
now 46 square meters per capita, then

923
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,520
the rural areas then take on

924
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,989
large terrain, so i think only in the

925
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:25,510
big cities i dealt with students at some point

926
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,949
, we took a closer

927
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,810
look for berlin i think it was in

928
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,820
berlin  almost ten square meters

929
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,340
lower per capita

930
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,480
and in turn in brandenburg it's

931
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,070
not quite the same as in others first of all it

932
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,630
doesn't matter in the field to clean up the rural

933
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,449
areas properly we have very

934
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:44,080
different per capita living space figures

935
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,969
there is also a much higher

936
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:48,520
dependency on the car households  have

937
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,469
two cars if you have grown

938
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:52,000
children  then we like to have three

939
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,940
cars and with it

940
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,800
we also cover decent distances to go shopping to

941
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,350
school and so on and so forth

942
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:02,590
but that is only half the truth if we

943
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,440
then want to talk about truth that is,

944
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,880
so to speak, the study by edward leser

945
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,320
and then there is  there were two more a

946
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,600
bit later in 2016, one from uba

947
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,000
from the Federal Environment Agency and the other from

948
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,240
a Finn whose name I always have to

949
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,800
write down, his name is joker

950
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,550
heinonen or

951
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,990
heinonen and they say the Federal Environment Agency also

952
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,200
has surveys on

953
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,030
consumer behavior with people in

954
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,980
rural areas, so to speak  made it he

955
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,290
didn't work and both are coming

956
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,390
so we now have three courses

957
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,510
i'm going to say edward laaser comes to

958
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,000
the very clear statement that

959
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,590
rural areas consume more resources

960
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,540
than in the city the federal environment agency says well no

961
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,580
that weighs a

962
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,710
little bit actually  is the

963
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:51,660
consumption of resources the same because it's

964
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,870
actually about economics  hey

965
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:59,290
circumstances and the more capital

966
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,810
and really economic capital in

967
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,580
the case people have at their disposal,

968
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,620
the less resource-saving they

969
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,960
live and these are mostly people in

970
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,430
the city who, for example,

971
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:12,220
fly more and that outweighs

972
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,900
the fact that you have one in everyday life

973
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,550
has less living space and

974
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,440
drives less car and so on if you add that

975
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,130
up then we are par par and

976
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,050
then comes secret and therefore says

977
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,040
no we have to if you say thank you even more

978
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,480
we also have to look at the

979
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,730
leisure activities because

980
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,310
there are in the cities right now  there is something that

981
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:34,420
he describes as parallel consumption and

982
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,940
that is the infrastructure that i

983
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,250
use and that also has an impact on

984
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,140
resource consumption and he

985
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,850
can show very clearly that leisure behavior is

986
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:45,040
not completely different

987
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,360
, so that takes place a lot at

988
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,650
home, that takes place  a lot of

989
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,420
clubs have a lot that

990
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,780
also happens outside while we do a lot in cities

991
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,820
there's a lot of talk about going to the cinema, opera, swimming pool,

992
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:59,150
going to the restaurant,

993
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,220
having food delivered and so on and so

994
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:05,050
rooms have to be

995
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,130
kept available and to put it

996
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,240
bluntly, the pub has to be heated and the swimming pool has to be

997
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,510


998
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,590
irrigated and heated and so on and

999
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,780
so forth and if so  we add that up

1000
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,880
as he has the power for finland he

1001
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,160
even comes to the opposite conclusion and

1002
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,410
comes to it that the city dwellers actually have a

1003
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,790
much higher consumption of

1004
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,800
resources so these are the

1005
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,300
only three studies that i am

1006
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,760
aware of that all come

1007
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,980
to a different conclusion, so to speak

1008
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,440
the poor von hain thing lights up and makes sense to

1009
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,920
me because i find the idea

1010
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,330
very interesting to say because i can

1011
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,850
if i talk about the individual level

1012
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,050
i can not only look at my

1013
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,360
living conditions and my

1014
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,650
mobility but i also have to

1015
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,870
look at something  no matter how I consume it and

1016
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,490
even if it also space I

1017
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,110
consume yes if  i

1018
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,850
had three pubs in three pubs in the evening

1019
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,290
and i had three

1020
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,590
beers yes but it doesn't matter

1021
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,020
and i find that a very interesting

1022
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:02,860
very interesting perspective

1023
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,530
somehow lying yes who lives only more

1024
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,090
resource-efficient

1025
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:09,370
probably is that

1026
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,570
i would say either it's a

1027
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,760
draw or  it just has

1028
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,820
n't been researched and thought through enough

1029
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,410
yet what else we have to

1030
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,730
calculate if we wanted to calculate something

1031
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,010
like that we could also ask

1032
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,530
how I love in everyday life and what is

1033
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,270
it like to conserve resources when

1034
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,550
I put my garbage in the  bio bin tour or

1035
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,500
when I give you in the garden on the compost

1036
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,600
and on mine we have to

1037
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,530
start counting up a lot of little things

1038
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,830
against each other

1039
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,580
yes that should be my

1040
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,380
nice research assignment I would like it

1041
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,820
if well I think that's

1042
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,410
kind of an

1043
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:46,000
old question for me too  also just with the

1044
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,960
goals of the

1045
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,010
settlement areas in the

1046
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,390
settlement areas develop  ung that we were

1047
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,950
less ground sealed

1048
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,510
that later everything somehow

1049
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:56,500
ends up together and I'm always

1050
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,730
amazed when I hear something like that that

1051
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,020
something like that hasn't been fully researched

1052
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,150
yet or that someone hasn't

1053
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:05,000
put on a big one and swept the facts together

1054
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,890
and looked at how it can

1055
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:09,339
now be calculated and because we do

1056
00:39:09,339 --> 00:39:11,119
urban development policy all the

1057
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,599
time and it keeps going and

1058
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,040
you could think about whether the

1059
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,300
goals shouldn't really be based on

1060
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,160
research,

1061
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,960
well, it's always a bit like that  the

1062
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,380
question where do you go chances

1063
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,760
and and above all who asks who who

1064
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,849
asks what well so as a space

1065
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:31,700
developer i say let's look at space

1066
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,820
consumption so

1067
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,410
i can of course do something about it yes

1068
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,970
i would say ok if that's our

1069
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:40,280
job  then it's our first

1070
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,200
task to think about it, that has to be the case, that's

1071
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,890


1072
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,570
such

1073
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,040
a high flat area in rural areas  there is energy consumption per

1074
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,810
capita the first problem starts

1075
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:50,420
with that that’s always one of my

1076
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,839
favorite examples yes we have a

1077
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:56,359
relatively banal village with 20 houses in

1078
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:58,700
all of these 20 houses

1079
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,220
four people used to live there two of them were

1080
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,810
children they have now moved out

1081
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,150
they live  everyone in berlin now only two people live in

1082
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,240
these 20

1083
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,560
houses sometimes even

1084
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,089
just one because of course it’s torn or someone lets them

1085
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:12,470


1086
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,970
decide yes if we look at the numbers now we can

1087
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:16,220
see

1088
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,220
the village is shrinking yes there are somehow over

1089
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,230
50  percent of residents moved away

1090
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:25,010
damn ax problem village but there are

1091
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,560
no vacancies because of course every

1092
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,020
house is occupied by at least one

1093
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,359
person, often in fact only by one

1094
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:34,940
person and then this one person lives

1095
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,599
in their 120 square meters of living space

1096
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,420
with another 1000 square meters of garden around it

1097
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,420
and then they tell you  the

1098
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,270
local mayor and mayor

1099
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,980
totally sad me  it was so terrible there

1100
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,270
was so much interest from young

1101
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,460
people to move to the village but the

1102
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,580
bad state planning forbade him to

1103
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,680
designate new building areas yes so

1104
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,720
i would say if there is a problem with the

1105
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,430
hammer actually a problem how

1106
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:04,010
we use the space on a small scale  it would be

1107
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,800
the way for me to say we

1108
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,000
have to see how we

1109
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,920
reorganize it yes with our large

1110
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,080
living areas where few people live of

1111
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,600
course somehow aunt

1112
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,210
käthe doesn't want to share her veranda with a

1113
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,950
stranger now because it was always

1114
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:21,080
hers  Yes,

1115
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,580
I know that it's somehow difficult as a

1116
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,920
person, but I think we have to start right there

1117
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,050
with what

1118
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,120
we already have, how can we

1119
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,670
simply distribute it differently

1120
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,810
, we don't have to create the large

1121
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:35,510
new building areas on the outskirts of the village, that's

1122
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,950
it  only this way and i know it's

1123
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,900
not easy but that would be my thrust, so to speak

1124
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,790
, where i

1125
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,100
would start and if then a  m at the end of the day

1126
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,930
somehow 10 kilometers

1127
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:47,810
are driven by car or only 5 i do

1128
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,100
n't know if it really

1129
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,110
matters then yes it's provocative of me now

1130
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:54,670
but i also want to be provocative sometimes

1131
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,990
so we now have an

1132
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:02,710
unfortunately still unclear situation

1133
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:06,230
so what is the most efficient way

1134
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,720
of developing our settlement areas now

1135
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,090


1136
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:14,630
what are we then arguments that

1137
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,310
you could bring to him to say if in

1138
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,410
doubt we can

1139
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,760
simply afford the rural area so what does

1140
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,220
the rural area bring us well one well

1141
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,410
two arguments are first  quite

1142
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,090
banal because you remember at the

1143
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,250
beginning I should have talked about definition

1144
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,840
yes if we say we

1145
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,730
do it how is an institute then

1146
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:33,920
at least 47 million people live in

1147
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,440
rural areas germany well well of

1148
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,970
course with us they do yes it is

1149
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,090
clear

1150
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,380
that  is i would say my son a

1151
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,030
banana points second point is the

1152
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,710
second point is that w  we in

1153
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,990
germany have also actually agreed on the so-called equivalent legal provisions

1154
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:50,270
on the basic law and also on the

1155
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:52,280
spatial planning act,

1156
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,610


1157
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,690
so no one should be

1158
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,640
disadvantaged because of their place of

1159
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,100
residence that is there has been a little bit in

1160
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,600
the last few years do

1161
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,830
n't know can go into it any further about one

1162
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,620
to make another podcast

1163
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,660
but the fact is it's not about the same living conditions,

1164
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,310
it's about the

1165
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:10,870
same opportunities

1166
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:13,750
and everyone should have them, so to speak,

1167
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,430
that's a social question, that's what

1168
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:17,470
society has agreed on,

1169
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,320
that's the status quo, so to speak, the

1170
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,120
other point is, of course  even

1171
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,190
if you argue from a strictly urban

1172
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:26,560
perspective and say i

1173
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,540
'm convinced everyone has to live in the

1174
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,770
big cities and that's the

1175
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,960
future yes even then i maintain

1176
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,230
this convinced urban

1177
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,780
view

1178
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,580
consumes rural space

1179
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,710
both in the physical sense in the sense of

1180
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:44,350
food production  and of course

1181
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,180
so and so the food

1182
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,920
percent within they want

1183
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,780
to live somewhere even if there are maybe

1184
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,880
not that many anymore but that is

1185
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,500
a function that we have in

1186
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,610
society and it's not

1187
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:55,780
about food it's also about

1188
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,960
energy

1189
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,740


1190
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,840
production those are the big issues yes energy production according to medium production

1191
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,160
and it is about the recreational function

1192
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,830
so we also live in a

1193
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:09,250
society where we say it is

1194
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,330
necessary we have organized our whole

1195
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:12,820


1196
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,890
working life in such a way that there are vacations so that there should be breaks in working life

1197
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,660
that people

1198
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,400
somehow get out of their everyday lives well

1199
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,110
where did they all

1200
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,970
go yes they mainly go to the country in the

1201
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:24,580
mountains to the water to the lake

1202
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,920
whatever yes i mean berlin is

1203
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,930
known for the fact that

1204
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:31,510
berliners somehow am  weekend

1205
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,700
in the regional train to go to the

1206
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,410
next best thing yes and then you

1207
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:36,820
want d  I'd like to have

1208
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:39,640
some fries by the lake, yes, who should

1209
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,830
sell the fries, please put it very

1210
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:44,710
bluntly, but there is

1211
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:47,680
this balancing act between city and country

1212
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,790
, I think we have to get used to that in the medium term,

1213
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,230
a little bit,

1214
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,610
because  there are simply

1215
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,590
different functions that keep

1216
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,790
society alive to a certain

1217
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,110
extent and, above all,

1218
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,540
keep it nice and fun is also very

1219
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,970
important

1220
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:02,170
one point that i found very exciting

1221
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:03,369


1222
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:04,960
an absolute pro argument for

1223
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,119
rural areas comes from the interview

1224
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,579
with flat  von rammstein he

1225
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:11,529
just

1226
00:45:11,529 --> 00:45:13,769
told us about his earlier days and

1227
00:45:13,769 --> 00:45:17,279
said in the gdr they had

1228
00:45:17,279 --> 00:45:19,269
restrictions on what they could say when

1229
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:20,559
they were in the cities but when they performed in

1230
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:22,599
rural

1231
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:25,119
areas there was no control and they

1232
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,630
could just do it  quasi your political

1233
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,460
opinions and

1234
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,359
just saying what you wanted to say i actually found that

1235
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:32,890
too  h a very, very good point the

1236
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:35,170
absolutely pro rural area means it

1237
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:36,749
is actually doubly interesting

1238
00:45:36,749 --> 00:45:40,329
because rural areas are

1239
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:41,529
also known for the fact that the

1240
00:45:41,529 --> 00:45:44,049
social control is particularly high

1241
00:45:44,049 --> 00:45:45,849
so many leave their home village

1242
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:48,910
because of the high social control in the

1243
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:50,680
image of the city dwellers and  flanke is a

1244
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,230
convinced later even if he i

1245
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,190
don't even know where i come from i'm extra

1246
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:56,309
from northern

1247
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:58,329


1248
00:45:58,329 --> 00:46:00,180


1249
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,440


1250
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,839
germany i myself rural area actually traditional freedom even to this day even in this new country love it's all about the sun about

1251
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:07,480
your freedom to be able to breathe or

1252
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,670
not  not that no one is

1253
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:12,809
listening to be able to do what no one sees

1254
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:16,359
big well she who the surface somehow makes

1255
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:18,579
such a feeling of freedom

1256
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:20,349
there we are again like that with the

1257
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:21,519
perception believes freedom

1258
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:23,589
or feeling of freedom is a

1259
00:46:23,589 --> 00:46:25,239
huge issue whether it is always true

1260
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:28,200
that way is also  put back

1261
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,038
nice argument clearly

1262
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,960
the

1263
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:39,869
[laughter]

1264
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:42,249
I was just going into

1265
00:46:42,249 --> 00:46:44,259
your research on social

1266
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,940
innovation in rural areas. You

1267
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,230
said that people come back with know-

1268
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:49,380
how and bring it here.

1269
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,720
There are more or less innovations and

1270
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,200
that innovation in rural areas only occurs

1271
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,470
because new people have left

1272
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:01,660
have come or because completely new

1273
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,460
people have come or are there

1274
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,849
also so that's one

1275
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:08,499
thing at some point when so who and what do they

1276
00:47:08,499 --> 00:47:10,150
do what does the people who

1277
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:12,579
are there actually do so the

1278
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,500
existing

1279
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,770
congregations can't make it on their own or are

1280
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:20,830
they  also active myself without moving there are

1281
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:23,320
both there are both i can give you a

1282
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,260
good example, namely a

1283
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,090
village in rhineland palatinate in the

1284
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:30,940
volcanic eifel with 800 inhabitants double village

1285
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:34,000
so it doesn’t matter in detail it’s

1286
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,690
not that important

1287
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:40,260
let me say an established

1288
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,940
village community with clubs and

1289
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,370
football club and fire brigade and everything

1290
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:46,410
possible

1291
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:50,140
and there are community structures in rhineland palatinate

1292
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,580
a bit

1293
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,690
different there is the so

1294
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:53,980
-called federated community then there is the

1295
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,270
local community and the federated community the

1296
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:58,120
mayor has started a

1297
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,030
process where he has carried out future workshops in all the

1298
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:03,340
communities i think there are 39 or so that belong to the

1299
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,620
federated community

1300
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,750
and

1301
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:08,710
actually need them

1302
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:11,100
do that regularly

1303
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:15,310
and during this future

1304
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,740
workshop, in this 1 community that

1305
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,300
we then looked at, over a

1306
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,100
period of time

1307
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,810
, 120 people really spent the whole

1308
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:24,310
weekend at this future workshop

1309
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,950
and thought about what difficulties we

1310
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:28,330
actually have here

1311
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:30,100
and what  actually bothers us

1312
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,070
and they came so they had

1313
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,570
such different points but one point

1314
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:36,820
was that they were so annoyed that they used to

1315
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,430
have four bars and they all closed

1316
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:40,720
and he

1317
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,670
actually lacks the social meeting place and then there

1318
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:43,810
was one and he has that  always so beautifully

1319
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:45,820
described who had the idea again  he opened

1320
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:48,070
a new pub himself without an

1321
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:49,870
operator and somehow trying to do something

1322
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:51,280
then everyone with a

1323
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,900
sign like that somehow stood in his

1324
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,190
corner and looked for it somehow as a

1325
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:56,260
comrade-in-arms and he stood there with his

1326
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,120
pub sign all alone and

1327
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:01,300
nobody wanted to go to him  that's how it is told and

1328
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,710
then there was another group that

1329
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,360
had a different sign under

1330
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,970
some sort of communication and information

1331
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:08,790
and at some point said you know

1332
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,750
routine I'll call you now if

1333
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,000
his name wasn't that

1334
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,170
come with us we can do

1335
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:15,790
two things that do  here's

1336
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:18,130
your village newspaper and we'll think about what

1337
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,870
are the things that we really

1338
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:21,580
lack in a pub and can't we

1339
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,830
somehow

1340
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:25,480
manage it digitally well and then one thing came along

1341
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,910
and that was the first community that did

1342
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:31,210
n't have a model project of its own accord

1343
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:33,609


1344
00:49:33,609 --> 00:49:36,940
an app asked a fraunhofer institute to use a diedorf app

1345
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,820
for their own community  e to

1346
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:41,890
implement there was no new arrival

1347
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:44,830
there was no returnee at all

1348
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:47,200
but it was, so to speak, the one there but

1349
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,850
it needs an occasion and that is

1350
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:51,060
actually the interesting custom as

1351
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:53,290
we have described it

1352
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,500
so it needs the right actors

1353
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,900
and it needs the right window and opportunity

1354
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,340
it has to be somehow i need a

1355
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,260
problem needs the right players

1356
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,480
and that need a window of possibility and

1357
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,030
this window of opportunity can be a

1358
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:08,200
lot it can be a

1359
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,940


1360
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,490
workshop for the future but it can also be the newly arrived couple

1361
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:13,900
like in another village which we are

1362
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,450
looking at the from  rehabilitating oneself from the old

1363
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:18,550
village consumption yes is also a place

1364
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:19,900
is another type of possibility

1365
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,369
window is because it has just been

1366
00:50:21,369 --> 00:50:22,720
sold and very active people are buying

1367
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,490
it but we tell you it is not for us

1368
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,440
we are in the for the entire village and

1369
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,560
we want it  it becomes an open space

1370
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,609
and that's sort of

1371
00:50:30,609 --> 00:50:32,320
the point and whether that's clear now

1372
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,030
that's right you're absolutely right to

1373
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,040
draw the line again there are

1374
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,460
often newcomers or people

1375
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:42,490
who have returned set this process in motion,

1376
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:44,460
so to speak

1377
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,240
I see a question that

1378
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,510
comes from somewhere

1379
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:53,310
[laughter]

1380
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:56,260
how does the population in

1381
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,180
rural areas react to the move  from the

1382
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,150
city that fits just so well went

1383
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:04,140
extremely differently

1384
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:08,260
there so you have to

1385
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,970
really differentiate because it depends

1386
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:11,980
on the quantity so where is, for

1387
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:14,050
example, really there are always big

1388
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:16,720
conflicts, surprisingly enough, in the

1389
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,300
suburban area

1390
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,490
where then, so to speak, where  there is actually no

1391
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:23,260
longer an old population in quotation marks

1392
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:26,080
and there have actually

1393
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,780
always been major conflicts there are

1394
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,580
also in a village what i

1395
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:34,119
have in

1396
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:35,859
mind right now was two couples who had moved here who were very active and were

1397
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:37,540
even the same age

1398
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,520
, who reacted completely differently  and it

1399
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,520


1400
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,570


1401
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:48,370
really depends on how you behave, you can do that with julier  by the way, i was

1402
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,140
talking about the future places network

1403
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:53,080
which types of conflicts you

1404
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,330
actually find because

1405
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:57,720
it's a group of

1406
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,310
comparatively young people

1407
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:01,360
my age, so you don't

1408
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,520
have to move them together in a

1409
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,450
small village anymore  and she always says well

1410
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:09,520
you have

1411
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,050
to accept that other things are

1412
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:13,180
important yes and if you

1413
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,760
accept it her example is that whenever

1414
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,920
my tree falls over and onto the

1415
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,360
neighboring property then i have

1416
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,890
to clear it away the next day if

1417
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:22,570
you please  i don't leave it there even if i don't

1418
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:23,590
give a damn about my

1419
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:25,330
socialization in berlin

1420
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:26,770
that this is why this tree fell yes

1421
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:28,900
but that's part of it that's part of it

1422
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,520
and i have to do it and if

1423
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,960
i show that i internalize the

1424
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,780
implicit rules of the village, so to speak

1425
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,800
then really

1426
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,860
wonderful relationships

1427
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:41,380
can arise and there are a lot of

1428
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:43,870
to  all things but i also know stories

1429
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:47,380
of people who did

1430
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:50,170
great projects for two years

1431
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,610
and then made

1432
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,200
a small mistake at some point and

1433
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,400
suddenly became persona non grata.

1434
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,410
i know a mayor who has

1435
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,330
exactly this example and is always very

1436
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:03,400
present  super successful as

1437
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,110
having moved in has really great things

1438
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:06,580
and everyone says if he hadn't come

1439
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,290
our village wouldn't look the

1440
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:10,390
way it does and he says himself

1441
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:13,660
but he can't guarantee that he wo

1442
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:16,000
n't do something in two years

1443
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,440
don't really know what

1444
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,870
he did it and suddenly he's the bad

1445
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:21,820
guy and he just looks so stupid

1446
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,800
and doesn't really know what's happening

1447
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,610
what's the matter but maybe this

1448
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:29,680
typical bad townsman comes to the

1449
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,720
country that's of course also the case

1450
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,330
it's kind of like that  picture yes

1451
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:36,610
big suv doesn't say hello very big topic by the way

1452
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:39,730
yes if you

1453
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:41,890
interview people au  f the villages it

1454
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:44,310
's always about whether the people say hello

1455
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:48,010
so the greeting is incredibly important

1456
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:50,080
so how did you listen to yourself he

1457
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,380
doesn't even say hello so he

1458
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,390
doesn't go anymore and the children the

1459
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,190
biggest don't even like that  especially

1460
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,980
in brandenburg this greeting is incredibly important

1461
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,420
which makes a lot so the

1462
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,700
answer is unfortunately unsatisfactory

1463
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,349
i can now only ask the questioner or the

1464
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:08,910
question and say because there is simply

1465
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:10,529
everything yes there are great times

1466
00:54:10,529 --> 00:54:11,749
there are totally

1467
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:15,240
broken relationships but you can

1468
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,480
do something actively  turn it on

1469
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,499
there was a bit

1470
00:54:19,499 --> 00:54:21,630
of a report yesterday as well as how the actors

1471
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,549
here on site are now exactly so

1472
00:54:23,549 --> 00:54:24,839
you can actually talk to

1473
00:54:24,839 --> 00:54:27,269
marco beckendorf or the people in

1474
00:54:27,269 --> 00:54:29,849
coconut yes they try

1475
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,190
that too they try yes  also

1476
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:33,660
to somehow establish

1477
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,960
relationships between city dwellers and

1478
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,410
non-city dwellers, a

1479
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:43,890
majority of about six with a

1480
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:45,650
little over ten couple more  minutes

1481
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:48,930
i definitely wanted to ask the

1482
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:52,559
question about the relationship between

1483
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,450
urban exodus and rural exodus these are

1484
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:56,190
somehow always such trends for me

1485
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:57,420
that one comes up then the

1486
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,420
other comes up and so without having

1487
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,130
researched it it feels a

1488
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,150
bit  as if it were always like that

1489
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:05,009
economic cycles that take turns

1490
00:55:05,009 --> 00:55:06,119
that one comes the other and then

1491
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:09,230
just come out

1492
00:55:09,259 --> 00:55:12,420
so that's right that's really a

1493
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,759
cycle that takes turns why

1494
00:55:14,759 --> 00:55:16,369
does that

1495
00:55:16,369 --> 00:55:18,539
do something to the rooms with the

1496
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:19,920
people we should maybe

1497
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,920
watch what we do there

1498
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,630
do it's actually not true, but

1499
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:26,519
you probably know that too, because if

1500
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:29,460
you look at it more or less globally, yes,

1501
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,599
the trend is already that of urbanization right

1502
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:35,880
now, it seems like it's going

1503
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,450
to reverse a bit, but it's

1504
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:42,569
only reversed on a small scale  it's

1505
00:55:42,569 --> 00:55:44,579
just the other way around that the loss isn't

1506
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:46,680
that big anymore, but

1507
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,950
at least so far we haven't experienced this

1508
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:52,829
big r  And on the rural on the

1509
00:55:52,829 --> 00:55:54,920
rural areas that

1510
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,140
didn't we experience what's

1511
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,329
more interesting about the question is when

1512
00:56:00,329 --> 00:56:03,800
we and they look at the waves of soup barney

1513
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,960
ization because that's

1514
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,190
actually a little bit

1515
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:09,140
like a big super bunny ization

1516
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:11,780
wave in the 60's  and then

1517
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:14,060
here in berlin brandenburg in the 70s

1518
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:15,830
about his from germany in general but

1519
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,010
also in the 90s

1520
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:20,060
and now a little bit

1521
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:23,620
stronger that has but

1522
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:26,450
that also has a lot to do with politics

1523
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:29,330
and with generations so on the one hand

1524
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:30,590
i think we have that  still a bit

1525
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:32,650


1526
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:34,970
municipal i'm not a municipal

1527
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:36,830
economist but that's a bit

1528
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:38,330
problematic that it's

1529
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:41,060
actually only good for a municipality if more

1530
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,160
residents are to move in

1531
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,190
and report them as

1532
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:47,930
well i've learned that there has to be

1533
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:50,270
one  yes yes of course pay then

1534
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:52,520
otherwise or or if you have a

1535
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,630
second home tax that means of course

1536
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:55,070
au  I'm not the worst owner of a second home

1537
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:57,200


1538
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,260
, but you don't really want to do that

1539
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,280
, but that's actually good, so to speak.

1540
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,330
That means I'm

1541
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:04,070
always

1542
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:06,170
interested in growing as a community,

1543
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:07,070
I think that's a bit

1544
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:08,780
problematic, but that's it for now  can

1545
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,250
i get away from the as i can get away from the

1546
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:12,680
question is also an exciting topic

1547
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,470
who am i too but it wasn't

1548
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:16,850
a question but there was an

1549
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,040
interplay of exodus from the city and exodus from the countryside

1550
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,200
and i think that's

1551
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,660
actually more of

1552
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:25,870
one  generation eels ask so there

1553
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:28,190
is i really no study

1554
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:29,300
now that is just from my

1555
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,680
observation and everything i have

1556
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:34,690
read there are people in all generations

1557
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:36,320
with

1558
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,410
this and that ideas about life and these and that

1559
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:40,420
lifestyles and decisions about where to

1560
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,530
live are in

1561
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:44,420
a certain age are

1562
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:46,580
generally met in the family start-

1563
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:48,050
up phase again ne  u met that is also the

1564
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:51,140
phase where you tend to move, if at all,

1565
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,810
as one of two phases where you move to the

1566
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:55,730
rural area or in a

1567
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:57,200
rural area that is either a

1568
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,080
family and start-up phase or as a child

1569
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,900
okay you can follow along or the second

1570
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,910
moment is then  Quite often after the end of

1571
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:07,010
active working life, yes, that means

1572
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:09,470
we automatically have a generational cycle, so to speak,

1573
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:12,020
and then

1574
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:14,440
we always have a question of political

1575
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:18,350
perspectives, so I can

1576
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:21,290
still remember very well when I was

1577
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:22,370
studying, I started studying

1578
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:25,070
that  has 99 city and region there was still

1579
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:27,890
the big issue of help help the city of

1580
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:30,670
berlin is very afraid that the

1581
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:32,870
middle class will now completely leave the city

1582
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:34,250
and only the

1583
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,960
social welfare recipients will stay behind that means we

1584
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,870
somehow need more attractive

1585
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:42,170
living space for a middle class

1586
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:45,290
so that they stay in  a few years

1587
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:49,130
later it was the other way around you can,

1588
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,690
so to speak, take the medium ski

1589
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:52,970
cht hold in a certain way

1590
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:56,990
and she goes again yes but yes it

1591
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:58,400
actually has and i sometimes have the

1592
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,260
feeling you forget your own politics

1593
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,910
that was a political decision

1594
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:05,150
you wanted the townhouse is consciously

1595
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:08,000
in the city quarters around the

1596
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,600
young families there  so to keep and that they

1597
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,790
are then occupied when the

1598
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:15,620
next generation comes that it

1599
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,660
is somehow logical because that is

1600
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:19,420
such a generational question

1601
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,770
accordingly it will of course be as

1602
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:23,690
long as society

1603
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:25,850
works the way it works i.e.

1604
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:27,170
if we don’t make any great

1605
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:27,920
changes now  social conditions

1606
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,630
then we have

1607
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:31,250
a generation a cycle and also in

1608
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:33,380
political cyclos well we support

1609
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:35,150
that and then that is blocked for a

1610
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:37,280
generation yes if in the

1611
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,280
70s I somehow conjure up a new building area on the

1612
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,350
green field then we are

1613
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:45,830
in the  In the 1970s somehow 25 to 30 year old

1614
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:47,360
people with one or two children

1615
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,640
moved in  They're 50 years older today

1616
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,070
and she still lives there and

1617
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:54,140
at some point I'm sorry but at some point they'll

1618
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,390
die and then there's

1619
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:58,940
a turnover again so that's why there's a

1620
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:02,540
certain amount of back and forth of course

1621
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,220
always due to generations, but

1622
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:05,840
basically I'll stay  the big

1623
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,340
trend is still an

1624
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:10,330
urbanization trend

1625
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:13,220
, unfortunately it's almost over the last question

1626
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:15,100
i really want to ask is

1627
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:18,380
which lines of development for the

1628
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,619
rural areas

1629
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:24,170
can now be thought of

1630
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:26,049


1631
01:00:26,049 --> 01:00:28,849
based on what we have about the new

1632
01:00:28,849 --> 01:00:30,980
governing coalition  contract that

1633
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,319


1634
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:34,609
you have signed and about the composition of the

1635
01:00:34,609 --> 01:00:36,260
parliament and the federal ministry

1636
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:38,200
so what about

1637
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,849
your future view, especially with what

1638
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:42,309
we have there as a system

1639
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:45,769
i think actually was

1640
01:00:45,769 --> 01:00:48,589
as far as the funding structures are concerned i don’t think it’s

1641
01:00:48,589 --> 01:00:50,809
changing that much

1642
01:00:50,809 --> 01:00:53,119
that has more to do with  the new eu so

1643
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,849
now he starts the new eu

1644
01:00:54,849 --> 01:00:57,019
funding period  also different has much

1645
01:00:57,019 --> 01:00:58,880
more to do with it yes joint task of

1646
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,779
regional development

1647
01:01:01,869 --> 01:01:04,970
there was a huge turn

1648
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:06,260
actually after the last

1649
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:07,210
federal

1650
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:10,160
election in 2017 i think that will be continued to a large

1651
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,319
extent far and that is

1652
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,000
a topic that we will

1653
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,950
not touch on once in an hour and

1654
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:18,049
that's why i want to say that

1655
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:21,500
the great fear of increasing

1656
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,109
radicalization and increasing

1657
01:01:24,109 --> 01:01:26,119
right-wing populism, especially in

1658
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:27,829
rural areas, which in my

1659
01:01:27,829 --> 01:01:29,839
opinion was the huge driver, take a

1660
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:32,420
closer look again, that's

1661
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,490
the one direction that

1662
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:36,380
really promotes community and

1663
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:40,309
community spirit  we're

1664
01:01:40,309 --> 01:01:42,259
on the way to that i think so and

1665
01:01:42,259 --> 01:01:43,880
the second thing that i can't yet

1666
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,430

1667
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:49,509

1668

01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:03,369
closing statement or special closing statement

yes we are still doing that now so

1676
01:02:05,569 --> 01:02:08,230
we still have questions

1677
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:10,789
or is the question whether the question has already

1678
01:02:10,789 --> 01:02:12,680
been answered well and which has also

1679
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:15,279

1683
01:02:24,309 --> 01:02:27,680
to hear about the rural area

1684
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,510
scientific consideration when I move to

1685

a room where we have just moved with a new

1686
01:02:31,339 --> 01:02:34,099

think well integrated so thank you very much

for that

1690
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:46,520
the fact that we were allowed to be there for the

1691

1692
