4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,840
wikidata for data journalists by

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:24,560
elizabeth giesemann

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,640
so our agenda for today is that we will

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,479
have a look on key points of data

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,800
journalism

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,800
we will quickly explain what wikidata is

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,239
what tools you can use inside of

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,879
wikidata for data visualization

12
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,879
what other third-party tools are there

13
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,519
for your research

14
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,760
then we have a look at critical research

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,000
done with wikidata

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:58,079
and finally we have a critical look on

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,320
the data of wikidata itself

18
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,399
points of data journalism are that you

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,400
want to interview a data set

20
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,799
so you want to find connections

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,320
correlations and causalities

22
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:14,240
behind the data also you want to

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,119
visualize the data in a compelling way

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,158
and you want to write your own story you

25
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,920
want to find

26
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,720
a new spin and a new look

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,320
on add defects and all of these things

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,320
you can do with wikidata

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,759
at wikimedia.com we want to support

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,520
evidence-based reporting

31
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,240
that's why we want to support you in

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,840
using wikidata

33
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:49,360
also data journalism helps you to tailor

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,360
your story to the users or your readers

35
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,320
data journalism helps you to create

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,439
visual storytelling instead of

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,798
walls of text and this again helps you

38
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,559
to convey

39
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:06,719
facts faster and way more easy

40
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,719
and that makes your story way more

41
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
inclusive

42
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,520
so how do you get to a story with

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,840
wikidata

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,599
you want to find and recognize patterns

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,640
in a data set

46
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,519
you can search for geographical data you

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,480
can search for

48
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,040
similarities and differences in the data

49
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,920
and you can also search for missing data

50
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,920
because that also exists in wikidata

51
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,040
you can visualize your findings with the

52
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,238
tools that you find

53
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,200
in the wikidata query service and what's

54
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,200
most important

55
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,319
is you can connect to the wikidata

56
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,920
community

57
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,160
and find people who are working on a

58
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,879
similar subject or have a similar

59
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,519
research

60
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,840
research question to the one that you

61
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,840
have

62
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,879
so i included this visualization to show

63
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,080
you that

64
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:05,120
data is only the beginning of

65
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,400
your story and the path

66
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,760
that you will take we want you

67
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,560
to use the data in wikidata for

68
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,399
to create a compelling story and

69
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,519
therefore

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:23,760
contribute value and your

71
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,760
idea about what's in the data

72
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,879
because data is a lot but it's not

73
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,518
everything

74
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,959
as we've seen in the last months many

75
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,440
people aren't convinced by

76
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:42,319
facts also there's a lack of time

77
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,280
and there is a lack of data list data

78
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,480
literacy

79
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,159
in our society it's not always easy

80
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,440
to understand the complexity of

81
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,519
historical events and developments

82
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,480
to understand the complexity of medical

83
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,239
data or

84
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,798
demographic changes so it is important

85
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,640
to have

86
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,680
a storytelling aspect to your data

87
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,040
have good visualizations and an easy to

88
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,159
understand approach

89
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,439
to convey the significance of your data

90
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,519
and your story and finally it is

91
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,399
important to remain transparent

92
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,959
and clear about the use and analysis of

93
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,959
the data

94
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,680
so what is wikidata wikidata is a free

95
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,159
linked database that can be read and

96
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,400
edited by both humans and machines

97
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,720
so it is a database of linked open data

98
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,400
it that means that the data doesn't just

99
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,639
sit there in tables

100
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,520
it can be connected and combined with

101
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,560
other data

102
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,680
find on wikidata as such

103
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,919
it is a realization of the semantic web

104
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,919
as

105
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:02,159
dreamt by tim berners-lee

106
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,000
and also uh wikidata won a prize

107
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,479
for its realization of the semantic web

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,800
we just celebrated wikidata data's

109
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,919
eighth birthday

110
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,400
it currently holds 90 million items and

111
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,520
has

112
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,400
44 000 active

113
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,120
users and contributors which makes it

114
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,359
the most

115
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:29,680
edited wikimedia project

116
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,720
it was initially used to

117
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,680
or thought of to support the projects of

118
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,680
the other projects of the wikimedia

119
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,000
ecosystem

120
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,440
and seen as a central storage for the

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,720
structured data

122
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:49,440
of the sister projects like

123
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:53,840
wiki voyage wikisource and the most

124
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,840
famous wikimedia project wikipedia

125
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,400
but it also has another function which

126
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,080
means

127
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,840
which is to provide free and open data

128
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,400
to the internet and that became really

129
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,880
huge

130
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,919
as already said we now have more than 89

131
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,479
million data items on wikidata

132
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,000
a colleague of mine created this map and

133
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,159
you can see

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,360
here the geolocation data

135
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,199
that is in wikidata and we are very

136
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,240
proud that it's

137
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,000
distributed all over the world but it's

138
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,440
also we also take it with a grain of

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,479
salt because as you can see

140
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,880
it's very bright in europe and

141
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,800
on the east and west coast of the us but

142
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,240
there are very dark spots

143
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,680
where we can't uh

144
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,080
record the knowledge in the same way as

145
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,400
we do in our western societies

146
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,359
and that brings us to the question of

147
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,479
what is

148
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,680
knowledge equity and how can we actually

149
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,159
best serve

150
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,160
everybody in our global society

151
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,719
so how does it work wiki data holds

152
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,120
items

153
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,479
which are real things or concepts in the

154
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,520
real world like

155
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:25,360
berlin barack obama helium

156
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,159
and these items are identified with an

157
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,840
id

158
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:34,319
the queue id so q 76

159
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,318
or q

160
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:41,039
i don't i can't read the number now

161
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:45,360
so these items have labels descriptions

162
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:48,560
aliases and side links labels that means

163
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,680
it's described in all of the languages

164
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,160
that wikidata

165
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:57,199
holds currently those are around 300

166
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:02,080
descriptions are

167
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,080
forms to describe what the item holds

168
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,960
and aliases sometimes one item has

169
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,720
several names

170
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:15,359
etc etc an item also has properties

171
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,800
those are used to label the data like a

172
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,840
person is born

173
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,800
somewhere its date of birth or death or

174
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,638
the location

175
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,639
of a specific building

176
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,639
statements hold informations in property

177
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,039
so

178
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:38,719
p47 shares the border with another

179
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,718
like country or the population

180
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,598
statements also have qualifiers to

181
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,720
expand the information

182
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:50,080
and then also they have references

183
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,640
which is very important because

184
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,519
for scientific research you want to have

185
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,240
those

186
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,240
references

187
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,480
so here we see again our item berlin q

188
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,480
64.

189
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:13,680
the property is the population

190
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,680
of 3.7 million

191
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,640
so what's new about research with

192
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,320
wikidata is that

193
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:31,279
you can ask your own questions

194
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,920
before you would go to a library and

195
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,320
some

196
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,079
the librarians librarians are awesome

197
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,519
but they would give you books

198
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,800
um with specific facts in them

199
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,600
and you would consume them and try to

200
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,959
uh use them for your research at

201
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,920
wikidata you can

202
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,040
ask very specific questions that nobody

203
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,599
else came up with

204
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,680
before so for your research

205
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,839
you want to do your own wiki data

206
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,120
queries that's what we have the

207
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,120
wikidata query service for

208
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,480
the good news is that you don't have to

209
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,600
learn python or

210
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:14,079
r or become a data scientist

211
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,079
but you want to learn a bit of sparkle

212
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,040
we included a few resources here in this

213
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,519
presentation

214
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,599
and there's also going to be a talk

215
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,120
given by my colleague lucas

216
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,000
on the 29th on how to query wikidata

217
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,000
with sparkle

218
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,279
we also have a guided tour on wikidata

219
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,560
on our website

220
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,560
which i can recommend

221
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:48,720
okay so um

222
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:52,480
as said once you queried your data

223
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,760
you can visualize your results

224
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,160
for more compelling storytelling

225
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,680
and there are several ways of doing this

226
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,719
and i'm going to show you some of this

227
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,359
just to give you

228
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,360
an idea

229
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,320
you could for instance ask the query

230
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,320
service to show you

231
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:17,760
airports that are named after a person

232
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,160
and color code them according to their

233
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,160
gender

234
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,040
gender of the person not the airport

235
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
obviously

236
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,720
you can ask the query service show me

237
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:43,279
everything

238
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:46,160
connected to the item berlin

239
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,240
you can ask it to show you the

240
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,600
population of the countries that are

241
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:57,519
bordering

242
00:11:49,600 --> 00:12:00,240
germany and how it developed

243
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,040
you can also ask the query service to

244
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,480
show you

245
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:11,839
the most common cause of death

246
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:11,839
among noble people

247
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:24,800
or here it shows you an

248
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:28,320
historical overview of space probes

249
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,639
or all of the children and grandchildren

250
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:39,839
of

251
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:39,839
genghis khan

252
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,800
so we had a look on the visualizations

253
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,000
inside of wikidata's qibi service

254
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,560
but there are also tools that use

255
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,880
wikidata's data for their own

256
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,560
visualizations

257
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,880
and i'm going to show you some of them

258
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,880
now

259
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,120
so here is histopedia which

260
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:11,279
makes time beams of historical events

261
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,279
using data from wikidata

262
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:20,560
this is avontail basically it lets you

263
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,680
create your own private library and then

264
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,560
uses the data

265
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,439
from wikidata to describe the

266
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,439
publications

267
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,519
here is ask me anything

268
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,399
that's done by different researchers in

269
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,680
europe

270
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,320
and it lets you pose

271
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,120
questions in natural language to wiki

272
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,519
data

273
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,839
so you don't have to use the query

274
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,839
service

275
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,720
that's a way that to use wikidata that's

276
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:03,839
also used by a lot of

277
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,839
voice assistants like siri and alexa

278
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,120
and here you have scalia which is

279
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,480
basically a platform

280
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,839
for scientific publications that are

281
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:21,279
published under open access and it

282
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:25,199
and it can answer your questions like

283
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:28,720
who published what paper with whom

284
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:34,240
who and when or who wrote the first

285
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,240
paper on covet when was it published etc

286
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,880
and here we have a sum of all paintings

287
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,479
basically it's a database that creates

288
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,920
all of the paintings

289
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,360
in the world and lists their metadata so

290
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:58,719
you can combine it

291
00:14:49,360 --> 00:15:00,720
in your own specific way

292
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,240
so i showed you a couple of rece of

293
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,519
examples what you could do

294
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,800
um and i wanna uh

295
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:13,360
hint at other uh researchers

296
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:18,800
who did uh great stuff with wikidata

297
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,800
and used it for very cool storytelling

298
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,360
if my slides work ok here we go

299
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,480
so um

300
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,720
[Music]

301
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,759
women's representation and voice and

302
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,079
media coverage of the coronavirus crisis

303
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,880
that's the that's a study done by a

304
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:45,359
researcher called laura jones

305
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:47,959
regarding the representation of female

306
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,959
experts within the coverage of

307
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:50,959
coronavirus

308
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,560
it uses evaluations of wikipedia and

309
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,360
wikidata

310
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,359
to show

311
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,599
to show how much representation was

312
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,959
their

313
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:12,720
female experts um

314
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,719
and as we see it's not a lot

315
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,399
finally there's another great example i

316
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,880
want to tell you about

317
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:31,440
it's the project called enslaved.org

318
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,000
it's a linked open data platform based

319
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,360
on wikibase which is the

320
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:42,160
software behind wikidata

321
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,880
and it basically shows or it collects

322
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,160
and connects data related to the

323
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,680
transatlantic slave trade

324
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:54,319
so people who suffered under the slave

325
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,599
trade and the records that were done

326
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,480
by the people active in in this slave

327
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,320
trade

328
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,400
uh those data is collected

329
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,919
uh it has been collected in several

330
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,600
databases

331
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:13,760
and enslaved built one

332
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:18,799
large database to connect them

333
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:20,959
and rebuild the stories

334
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,199
which i think it's a really great idea

335
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,640
to or a really great way

336
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,600
to humanize people who've been

337
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:33,840
dehumanized

338
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:36,240
with data like you can see here um

339
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,678
they collect stuff they collect data

340
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,679
from newspapers

341
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:47,840
and um from the slaveholders

342
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,840
to recount the story of individuals

343
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,480
so finally i also want to talk to you

344
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,120
about

345
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,919
one thing at wikidata that is always on

346
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,719
our minds

347
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:09,679
which is that wiki data is not perfect

348
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,600
i highly recommend the talk by aus keys

349
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,559
question in wikidata

350
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,879
in which it is inclu explained that all

351
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,160
classification systems are inherently

352
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,880
dangerous

353
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,760
and wikidata is a large encyclopedic

354
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,039
wiki

355
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,080
classification system which makes

356
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:31,280
choices ethical and political

357
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:34,639
choices about what is notable

358
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:40,480
about how to

359
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:44,960
categorize information and these choices

360
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:48,080
they reduce complexity and they reduce

361
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:52,799
also specific forms of

362
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:56,639
uh of history like oral history

363
00:18:52,799 --> 00:19:00,720
this reduction has consequences as you

364
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:04,799
you know wikidata is used by many

365
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,840
programs apps voice assistants

366
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:12,240
and what what and how we store

367
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,240
information and wiki data really matters

368
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:24,799
so we ask ourselves what is

369
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:27,280
encyclopedic knowledge

370
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,120
and how can we organize it in a more

371
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,039
inclusive way

372
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,320
encyclopedic knowledge is a western

373
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:36,160
concept

374
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:39,520
and we can and must do better than just

375
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:44,880
use our own western

376
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:47,679
view to organize the world

377
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,960
but then also the wiki principle applies

378
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:54,480
we have a huge community behind wikidata

379
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:58,000
that helps us to make these decisions

380
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:01,280
and you can also become a part of this

381
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,200
by researching wikidata using it

382
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,840
for your work and also contributing

383
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,840
your research

384
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,880
so once again i want to tell you you can

385
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,840
use wikidata

386
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,720
as a tool for your storytelling wikidata

387
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,760
can help you find

388
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,520
connections between data wikidata can

389
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,919
help you find

390
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,080
can help you build visualization in its

391
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,200
query service

392
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,760
you can ask questions about historical

393
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,360
data correlations

394
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:40,720
more critically than you could uh

395
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,080
than you could before and but they're

396
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,200
also downsized

397
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,799
to downsides to wiki data because it is

398
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,240
an encyclopedic way of

399
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,240
organizing western knowledge

400
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,600
so this was only a start i'm looking

401
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,280
forward to our q a session

402
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:04,799
now and if you have further questions

403
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,720
concerns or have ideas you can contact

404
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,960
me and my colleagues

405
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,960
and you can also contact me individually

406
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,840
thank you

407
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,520
hello and welcome to elisabeth uh thank

408

you very much for your interesting

409
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:30,320
talk that was a very great introduction

410
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,879
hi uh yeah thanks for having me um

411
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,639
i'm happy that i was able to talk a bit

412
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,320
about wikidata and

413
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:41,919
um how you could do storytelling with it

414
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:44,399
um i wanted to add that obviously you

415
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,360
can ask me questions now

416
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,720
but also i want to hint at the great

417
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,280
introduction

418
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,720
of wikidata that one of my colleagues

419
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,520
gave

420
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,640
yesterday two of my colleagues which is

421
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,520
already online

422
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,120
and tomorrow there will be a query

423
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,600
service workshop

424
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,158
where you can learn a bit more in depth

425
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,520
how to

426
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,840
query wikidata yeah that's

427
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,440
a very good hint there's actually

428
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,080
there's two questions in the chat right

429
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,240
now

430
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,760
the first one is are your slides going

431
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,360
to be published

432
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,400
because people are interested in your

433
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,600
links to the tutorials obviously yes

434
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,320
that was uh i i asked before i think the

435
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,678
talk will be published and the slides um

436
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,399
[Music]

437
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,360
is there a wikipakka board where i can

438
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,559
put it

439
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,039
otherwise i can also put a link

440
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,440
on our twitter account wikimedia

441
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,480
deutschland

442
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,400
and yeah i think

443
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,240
twitter for now would probably be the

444
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,559
best idea i actually have to check

445
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,200
on the wikipedia board but we will let

446
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,678
you know where you can find everything

447
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,400
i put it on the wikimedia.com twitter

448
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,360
it's

449
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,360
at wmde

450
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,760
i think we will also retweet it

451
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,039
obviously

452
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,440
you will find it i promise okay there's

453
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,360
another question what resources would

454
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,480
you recommend for self-studying the

455
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,479
writing of queries for

456
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,480
queryrica.wiki.org

457
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:25,360
i put some links in the in the slides

458
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:28,640
there is yeah we have like a

459
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:32,320
few tutorials on wikidata there was also

460
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:35,280
a couple of months ago a very nice and

461
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,000
very easy tutorial published by

462
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,080
wikimedia

463
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,640
israel and i so we didn't do it but i

464
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:46,000
can recommend it it's a very

465
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,440
low-key introduction to your first

466
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,320
queries

467
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:55,120
okay we will also publish that somehow

468
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,720
um i have a question for you as well you

469
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,399
mentioned that wikidata is

470
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,919
like a great way for meeting other

471
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,520
people that are working on

472
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,679
similar topics so is there some kind of

473
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,879
like greater community of journalists

474
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,880
using wiki data

475
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,480
so far the community is mostly research

476
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,840
based

477
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,080
that's also why we wanted to reach out

478
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,439
here

479
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:24,799
i would recommend getting in touch with

480
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,640
the community on there

481
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,799
regarding the research topics that you

482
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,400
have and you can also

483
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:35,760
get in touch with us and we uh

484
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:39,520
connect you i have a noise in my

485
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:42,799
ear but i hope it's only me

486
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,480
well i don't have it so it might just be

487
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,039
you but i feel like there might be

488
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,960
also an echo on the stream but that's

489
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,559
what people on the chat are saying

490
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,960
ah okay so i don't have

491
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,720
any other questions in the chat and

492
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,120
since there seems to be an echo on the

493
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,919
stream

494
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,080
i don't want to annoy people any further

495
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,000
so i would suggest

496
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,760
for everyone who has further questions

497
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,120
to you and that you can

498
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,120
meet in our big blue button meetup room

499
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,360
that i will be posting in the chat right

500
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,360
now

501
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,799
and we will continue our program here

502
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:24,720
at 220 with another talk about

503
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:30,559
flutter by the one with the braid so

504
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,559
i'm saying bye for now thanks bye

505
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,569
[Music]

506
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,600
bye
