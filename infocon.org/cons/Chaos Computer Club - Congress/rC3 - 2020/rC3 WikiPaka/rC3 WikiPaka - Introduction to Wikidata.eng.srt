[Music]

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:11,689
[Laughter]

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:11,689
[Music]

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,119
hi

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,680
everyone i'm leah here's mohammed and

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,160
we're gonna

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,160
introduce you to wikidata today

8
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,800
yes hi everyone um so in the course of

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,440
the talk if you do have a question

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,360
just feel free to ask them in the chat

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,399
and then we are going to try and answer

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,160
them at the end of the talk

13
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:47,760
yes so let's dive straight in but it's

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,398
wiki data wiki data is a free knowledge

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,719
base

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,160
that is based on facts and references

17
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,520
that anyone can edit

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,160
and reuse it is part of the wikimedia

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,000
project

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,839
and like all of us to start opening

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,600
projects wiki data is

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,960
multilingual and has no language

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,360
barriers

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,720
um data and wiki data is released under

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,960
cc0 license

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,479
that means wikidata's data is in the

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,798
public domain

28
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,840
and it has no exclusive intellectual

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,479
property rights that is applied to it

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,840
um wikidata is not a primary source of

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,240
information

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,840
it only aggregates or collects

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,880
structured data that is already

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,400
available

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,000
some of which are links to other

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,600
databases

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,200
so it is not meant to be a place for

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,520
original research

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,680
um wikidata is made for humans and

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,720
machines and is available for everyone

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,119
to use

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,720
whether on order wik media projects or

43
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,439
outside of it

44
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,439
next slide

45
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,960
so what is in wikidata

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,680
wiki data was launched some eight years

47
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,880
ago

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,600
and was originally created to solve the

49
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,439
problem of

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,360
unstructuredness in the plain text

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,479
format that information in wikipedia is

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,799
rendered in

53
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,520
and also to provide a central storage

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,880
location

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,119
where all of the different language

56
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,478
wikipedias can connect and talk to each

57
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,800
other

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,200
today wiki data has since outgrown its

59
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,520
intended purpose and has become so big

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,238
and successful that

61
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,760
it's not only you know the most edited

62
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,560
wikimedia projects

63
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,280
but wiki details data is now used more

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,480
outside of the

65
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,400
media projects than within it

66
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,079
there are more than 25 000 active

67
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,160
editors

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,319
that means people who make at least one

69
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,200
edit every month

70
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,200
wiki data is used across 800 plus

71
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,399
wikimedia projects in more than 300

72
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,958
languages

73
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,280
and it's interesting to note that the

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,519
largest proportion of wikidata's items

75
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,040
are in the category of scholarly items

76
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,680
comprising about 30 of the whole

77
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,679
next slide

78
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,319
so far um people and bots have made more

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,159
than 1.3 billion edits to wikidata

80
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,079
and created more than 91 million items

81
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,840
this map you see here is a visual

82
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,879
impression of geolocated

83
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,920
items currently existing on wikidata so

84
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,079
the bride's areas are

85
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,958
items that have accordingly location

86
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,599
property added as a statement

87
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,599
next slide

88
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,879
so wikidata has a vision and what is

89
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,120
this version

90
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,798
we created wikileaks is to give more

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,640
people more access

92
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,560
to more knowledge so wikidata

93
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,319
gives access to information regardless

94
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,400
of the language that people speak

95
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,480
because wikidata is multilingual it

96
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,599
expects translations of so-called

97
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,000
q numbers into different languages and

98
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,439
so doing wikidata helps us support the

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,120
smaller wikimedia projects

100
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,640
better you know by helping them

101
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,640
to benefit from all of the work that the

102
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,958
bigger projects are doing

103
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,119
and applications and projects outside of

104
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,439
media are also able to benefit from the

105
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,239
rich data sets in wikidata

106
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,359
so in a nutshell wiki data can be

107
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,560
thought of as

108
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,000
an online repository of structured data

109
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,079
that anyone can edit

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,079
and reuse next slide

111
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,280
okay now how is wikidata connected to

112
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,840
wikipedia

113
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,159
and to the other wikimedia project among

114
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,840
other terms wikidata can ask the

115
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,919
sister project with more easily

116
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,560
maintainable info boxes

117
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,479
so the table at the right corner this

118
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,280
article on wikipedia is called an info

119
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,840
box which i'm sure you've seen before

120
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,280
wiki data is able to retrieve content

121
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,239
from wiki data into

122
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,239
those info boxes

123
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,479
and for smaller language wikipedias like

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
you know

125
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,800
uh that many wikipedia or welsh

126
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,000
wikipedia

127
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,400
that that readily leverages wiki data to

128
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,560
see

129
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,840
their content and this is helpful

130
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,400
because it's

131
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,919
it helps to reduce editing workload for

132
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,560
volunteers

133
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,560
next slide

134
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,639
so what should you expect to see on a

135
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,440
typical wiki data item

136
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,240
um wikidata expresses relationships in

137
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,280
the form of

138
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,639
triples they use items

139
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,559
starting with ql and properties starting

140
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,360
with p

141
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,080
okay and the i10 will typically be made

142
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,039
up of at least

143
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,120
one statement so in this example you see

144
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,400
on the screen we have two statements

145
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,360
about an entity called douglas adams

146
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,159
the first statement douglas adams was

147
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,720
educated

148
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,160
at p69 saint john's college

149
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,039
what this means is that this statement

150
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,240
is qualified by federal properties

151
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,120
that is the academic major the academic

152
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,319
degree

153
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,720
he start time and then the end time and

154
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,160
qualifiers add more meaning to

155
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,039
statements

156
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,160
so wikidata records not just statements

157
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,800
but also

158
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,160
their sources and as you can see here

159
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,160
this helps us

160
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,000
to reflect the notion of verifiability

161
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,360
on the project

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,080
so that statement douglas adams was

163
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,639
educated

164
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,680
at st john's college has two open

165
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,440
references

166
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,720
that points to the source of that

167
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,960
information

168
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,319
and the second statement douglas adams

169
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,880
q42

170
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:43,919
was indicated that p69 brentwood school

171
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:48,000
only has the qualifier start time

172
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,560
and end time and it has no references

173
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,599
so a single statement consists of a

174
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,080
property

175
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,159
that is made up of a value with or

176
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,919
without a reference

177
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:03,840
or with or without qualifiers

178
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,840
next slide

179
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,919
um so a typical wikidata item looks like

180
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,000
this

181
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,318
and you can edit by clicking on the edit

182
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,360
button it has this pen symbol with

183
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,560
edit next to it as you can see each item

184
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,599
has a unique id

185
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,800
that is ko followed by some number

186
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:28,639
in this case the item douglas adams has

187
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,319
a cable id of q42 and when you look at

188
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,199
the top there's a 10 box

189
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,720
um we call them we call it the time box

190
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,639
at the top of

191
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,080
at the top that contains the label in

192
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,039
different languages

193
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,240
a description of the items that is more

194
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,080
of a

195
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,280
short phrase telling us what the item

196
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,280
represents

197
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,479
it's easier in english that douglas

198
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,119
adams is an english

199
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,440
writer and humorist then there's the

200
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,960
alias next to the description which

201
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,199
aside from the label

202
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,159
tells us what the item could also be

203
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,160
known by here

204
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,879
next slide

205
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,759
so um creating a new item is as simple

206
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,520
as

207
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:17,520
going to any page on data and click on

208
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,758
create a new item and

209
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,198
once you click on create a new item you

210
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,280
get to fill in the form

211
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,800
that is asking for a label description

212
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,719
and an alias

213
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,280
and cable ids are assigned automatically

214
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,280
next slide

215
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:41,838
next slide

216
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,279
next slide please

217
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,160
all right so there are tools that allow

218
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,319
us to edit wiki data more efficiently

219
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:04,240
and make bulk edits to wiki data such as

220
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,240
quick statements and open refine

221
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,839
please go to the previous slide

222
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,640
okay yeah right so yeah um

223
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,519
quick statement and open refine allow us

224
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,120
to make

225
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,120
automated edits and changes to wiki data

226
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,360
other tools are available that allow us

227
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,480
to visualize wiki data's data

228
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,000
some of them enhances the user interface

229
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,920
of wiki data

230
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,360
and these could include scripts that

231
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,279
editors can install

232
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,839
or they could be gadgets that may be

233
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:50,000
enabled in your preferences settings

234
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:53,279
next slide

235
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,320
right so

236
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:59,760
um so far mohammed told you

237
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,079
about um how we describe concepts

238
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,880
in wikidata and that's we've been doing

239
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:07,279
for the first

240
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,240
years of the project but um in 2018 we

241
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,720
also started

242
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,160
storing a new type of information in

243
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,720
wikidata which is

244
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,839
lexicographical data which is basically

245
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,320
information about

246
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,839
words and phrases in all kinds of

247
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,880
languages

248
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,000
and so you see

249
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,720
on the left the data model that is a bit

250
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,240
complex

251
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,079
and that's why i'm not going to get too

252
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,600
much into details now but we can talk

253
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,680
about this later

254
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,920
and you can see an example on the right

255
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,560
where we basically describe the word

256
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,640
luf balon in in german and we indicate

257
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,160
the language the lexical category and

258
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,640
all kind of informations

259
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,880
that are not about the object anymore

260
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,839
but actually about the word and how it's

261
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,320
composed of

262
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:56,000
two words as we like to do in german

263
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,600
and things like this um so again

264
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,600
if you want to know more about this you

265
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,720
can have a look at lexicographical data

266
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,160
in wikidata

267
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,360
or we can talk about it together later

268
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,360
in the questions for example

269
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,839
so wiki data doesn't come alone it comes

270
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,518
with a bunch of tools that have been

271
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,279
some of them have been developed by the

272
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,480
development team of wikidata some of

273
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,000
them have been developed by the

274
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,000
community themselves

275
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,720
um in order to do things more

276
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,720
efficiently that can be for example

277
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,000
adding data and some of the tools have

278
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,959
already been mentioned by

279
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,160
muhammad that can also be matching data

280
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,119
with other databases

281
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:39,120
querying the data reusing the data there

282
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,040
are also a bunch of tools that are about

283
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,440
watching the data and watching its

284
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,319
quality watching what edits have been

285
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,240
done recently and so on and you can find

286
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,680
the page that is called with data tools

287
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,920
on wikidata

288
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,199
to discover uh plenty of these tools and

289
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,969
you can of course

290
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,070
create your own

291
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,070
[Music]

292
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,720
so we mentioned that the goal of

293
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,800
wikidata is to be reused by

294
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,880
everyone but you may wonder who's

295
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,599
actually reusing the data

296
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,320
well the first three users of wikidata's

297
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,399
data

298
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,200
is actually the wikidata community

299
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,639
itself the wikidata editors

300
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,519
because all of these items are connected

301
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,600
so one item can be linked from another

302
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,320
the content of one item can be reused on

303
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,600
one another

304
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,480
and so on the wikimedia project such as

305
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,160
wikipedia but not only wikimedia commons

306
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,920
wikisource

307
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,240
almost all of the wikimedia project at

308
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,680
that point reuse part of the data

309
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,959
that is coming from wikidata

310
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,079
and then we have uh companies um from

311
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:49,040
the biggest one to um

312
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,000
to the small ones um because the data is

313
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,639
in cc0

314
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,160
everyone can just reuse the content that

315
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,079
they need

316
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,760
we have of course public institutions

317
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:02,479
such as museums libraries and so on

318
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,839
we also have journalists and for example

319
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,000
data journalists we have scientists and

320
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,959
researchers

321
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,720
and um probably much more and the thing

322
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,160
is that we don't necessarily know who's

323
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,399
reusing the data because

324
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,240
it's here in the open but there are

325
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,399
probably many usages that

326
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,000
uh we don't even imagine so if you're

327
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,240
reusing wikidata if we

328
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,920
would like to use wikidata data let us

329
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,720
know because we are always interested to

330
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,719
discover more

331
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,880
now the question is how can one reuse

332
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,880
wiki data i'm going to present very

333
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,079
quickly one of the most popular way to

334
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,160
query the data

335
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,920
i'm not gonna get into details right now

336
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,360
because there will actually be

337
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,079
a workshop um at the conference um

338
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,920
in two days on on day three um about the

339
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,959
query server so i'm gonna let you go

340
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,240
there and discover

341
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,719
more about how to use it the query

342
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,279
service

343
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,279
is basically a sparkle endpoint sparkle

344
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,320
being a query language

345
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,399
where you can basically ask questions to

346
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,720
wikidata and get lists

347
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,959
or visualizations as results for example

348
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,079
here's the map of the airport of the

349
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,239
word

350
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,160
name after the person and the color of

351
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,279
the dot

352
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,800
represent the gender of the person

353
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:23,519
or you can make a list of

354
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,760
country flats that are including a sun

355
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,160
because if the data is properly modeled

356
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,760
in wikidata you're able to describe what

357
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:34,160
are the different elements

358
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:37,199
that compose a country flag

359
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,319
or you can have this bubble charts

360
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,359
with the occupation of

361
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,079
accused witches because why not that's

362
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,959
the kind of data

363
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,959
we have in wikidata

364
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,360
now there are other ways of course to

365
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,040
query the data

366
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,720
i'm not going to get into details right

367
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,719
now um but if you want to talk more

368
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,480
about this you can for example

369
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,480
join the wikidata meetups that are going

370
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,839
to happen tomorrow

371
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,240
we have dumps of the data

372
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,880
where you can download part of or all of

373
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,519
the data

374
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,920
in a file we have a bunch of apis to

375
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,880
access

376
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,959
data directly from your program and on a

377
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,360
wikimedia project specifically

378
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,479
the community developed a bunch of

379
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,360
templates

380
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,360
that are reusing wikidata's data using

381
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,880
lua

382
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,120
and now for something a bit different

383
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,720
wikibase you may have heard of it

384
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,880
and you may even have wondered okay

385
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,000
what's the difference between wikileaks

386
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,320
and wikidata

387
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,040
well wikibase is basically the software

388
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,480
powering wikidata and more precisely

389
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:48,240
the mediawiki extension that is turning

390
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:52,240
mediawiki into a database

391
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,399
and so wikibase was started to power

392
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,279
wikidata but it also started developing

393
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,600
on its own

394
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,959
wikidata is still for now the biggest

395
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,880
existing wiki-based instance

396
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:07,040
but people can also install wikibase

397
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,680
directly on their server and basically

398
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:13,360
create their own little personal

399
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,120
or public um wiki data and

400
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,199
the development is still ongoing there

401
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,959
are all kind of super exciting features

402
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,599
coming up soon and for example the

403
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:25,279
ability to connect better

404
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,279
wikidata and your own

405
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,560
instance of wikibase for example to be

406
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,560
able to reuse data

407
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,800
that is already in wikidata and to

408
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:37,520
connect it to the data that you have

409
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:40,399
in your own wikibase

410
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,560
[Music]

411
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,600
so if you're interested in wikidata if

412
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,279
you want to know more

413
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,519
there are a bunch of pages that you can

414
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,680
find there is a help portal

415
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,839
the project chat is the main discussion

416
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,839
page on the wiki where you can interact

417
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,440
with the other editors the community

418
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,800
it's super important to get in touch

419
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,160
with them if you want to get started

420
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,719
with wikidata

421
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,639
we also have a mailing list we have a

422
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,720
newsletter that is called weekly summary

423
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,319
that you can find on a wiki

424
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,240
but also if you subscribe to the mailing

425
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,918
list you will also receive it

426
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,599
and then we have some accounts on the

427
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,760
social media on twitter there is a

428
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,000
facebook group there is a telegram

429
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,799
um that is linked from the project chat

430
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,760
and there is

431
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,959
um also an irc channel so you can

432
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,720
basically find

433
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,470
people from the wikidata community

434
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,598
everywhere

435
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,598
[Music]

436
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,280
so we are approaching the end of this

437
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,320
session

438
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,520
um but it's not done we have

439
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,960
more wikidata related sessions um

440
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,120
at the c3 in the wikipakka

441
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,520
so for example tomorrow you're gonna get

442
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,360
an introduction to wikidera specifically

443
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,639
for journalists and especially data

444
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,000
journalists

445
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,080
then in the afternoon we're going to

446
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,120
have two wikidata meetups the first one

447
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,639
is going to be

448
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,239
in german the second one is going to be

449
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,080
in english so depending on your

450
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,799
preferred language you can attend one or

451
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
the other

452
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:04,559
or both and on day three um

453
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,120
as i mentioned before we're gonna have a

454
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,480
workshop to learn how to query

455
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,320
uh wikidata's data with sparkle

456
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,559
so feel free to have a look and check

457
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,240
them also in the main

458
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,240

thank you very much for attending this

460
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,799
session these are

chat or

465
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,039

right now

469
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,918
thank you for your input and the

470
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,559
overview about

471
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,960
wikidata there has been a few question

472
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,120
or

473
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,559
questions already answered by joel in

474
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,520
the irc channel

475
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,280
one was about the big dump of scholarly

476
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,960
data and what's quality data

477
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,799
is and how this came to be in wikidata

478
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,320
but there is one more question from the

479
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,960
chat right now

480
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,000
tiller asks can i add new types of data

481
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,120
that are not yet

482
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,120
tracked in wikidata

483
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,960
so i'm wondering what do you mean

484
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,120
exactly by

485
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,360
type of data maybe you can give a bit

486
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,639
more details because that can mean a lot

487
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,360
of things

488
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,799
um weekly data the data model of

489
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,360
wikidata is very

490
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,400
flexible and and it's absolutely not set

491
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,000
in stone

492
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,760
every every week the community comes up

493
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,080
with some new ways to describe

494
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,600
things sometimes we realize that there

495
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,080
is an area of the word that we

496
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,918
completely forgot to cover and then we

497
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,480
create new properties um to describe for

498
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,480
example a certain type of

499
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,160
i don't know of concept a certain type

500
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,320
of um

501
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,000
building or objects that we or

502
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,280
philosophical concept that we

503
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,400
um didn't um describe yet so this is

504
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,320
always um in movement in in action

505
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,559
when it comes to what we actually call

506
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,158
data types which is for example

507
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:14,480
a string of text or a date or a picture

508
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,240
we have all kind of data types like this

509
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,559
this is a bit more complicated and

510
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,240
overall it's quite rare that we add

511
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,559
a new data type and it needs a strong

512
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,360
like use case so we add that to the

513
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,120
software

514
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,360
i hope that it answered your question

515
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,320
and um if i didn't feel free to

516
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,280
ask again yeah we've got a feedback uh

517
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,320
the example till

518
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,760
till meant was there's a uh there's an

519
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,000
organization or a project called

520
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,000
parliament watch uh in germany

521
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,840
um there was one talk earlier this day

522
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,720
today where they tried to

523
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,120
well track and and scrape and analyze

524
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,520
the

525
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,799
parliamentary protocols and one big

526
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,440
issue they had was with

527
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,158
structural data about all the members of

528
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,960
parliament

529
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,760
and how they are organized and stuff

530
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,880
like that

531
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,480
and um well if i remember correctly

532
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,240
there actually was a project

533
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,679
that tried to include the structural

534
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,520
data of

535
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,600
members of parliament in wikidata if i'm

536
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,679
not mistaken

537
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,000
absolutely it's a weekly project that is

538
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,000
called

539
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,200
something politicians uh all politicians

540
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,039
i don't remember the exact name right

541
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,080
now but indeed um

542
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,799
some people are already working on um

543
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,360
mumbling parliaments and like political

544
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,639
um

545
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,280
people in general so it's very likely

546
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,000
that there is

547
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,799
already a way to structure the data the

548
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,799
best way

549
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,480
is to contact the people directly

550
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,158
involved on this

551
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,039
on this wiki project um wiki projects by

552
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,520
the way

553
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,120
are pages where basically people who

554
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,639
have a specific topic of interest

555
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,799
gather and can discuss about the

556
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,840
specific questions about this topic

557
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:57,520
um so um have a look at this

558
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,240
um at this project about politics and um

559
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,520
yeah try to see if um if anything is

560
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,280
missing but generally

561
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,200
um wikidata definitely welcome

562
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,200
information about

563
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,640
um about politicians about number of

564
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,039
parliaments this kind of stuff

565
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,679
what we do not do however is store the

566
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,679
full

567
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,600
like document for example in that case

568
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,120
the the reports or the documents

569
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,639
that belongs elsewhere maybe on

570
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,799
wikimedia commons for example if it's

571
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,720
possible if the license allows it

572
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,840
but on wikidata we'll be happy to store

573
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,159
the metadata about them

574
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,918
all right you'll you'll uh just posted

575
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,840
the link to the wiki project every

576
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,880
politician so if anybody

577
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,639
looks for every politician on wiki data

578
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,840
they will find the project so basically

579
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,360
the bottom line is

580
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,240
pretty much anything is possible in

581
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,240
wikidata right

582
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,360
yeah thank you and hi um almost

583
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,039
everything so on wiki data just like on

584
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,080
wikipedia we still have

585
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,679
some criteria to define what can get in

586
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,480
wikidata and what not

587
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,240
because um we are aware that this

588
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,760
knowledge base it needs to

589
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,919
stay quite general and it cannot contain

590
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,080
absolutely everything for example the

591
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,480
community decided a while ago that they

592
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,600
would not create one item for each

593
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,799
human living or who used to live

594
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,719
on earth that's just not possible so

595
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,840
there are some notability criterias that

596
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,120
you can find

597
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,559
in the help pages and um i would say

598
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,039
that

599
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,399
the level of like how fine-grained the

600
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,559
data should be

601
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,559
has to be discussed with the community

602
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,600
and the good thing about having wikibase

603
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,000
also available

604
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,840
as a separate instance of wikidata is

605
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,559
that if some people want to work on a

606
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,799
topic

607
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,879
where they have some information that is

608
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,400
very very specific and would maybe not

609
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,799
fit the scope of wikidata

610
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,799
they can create their own wiki base and

611
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,600
then they can connect the content

612
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,000
with what is already in wikidata so all

613
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,120
together in this wiki based ecosystem

614
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,559
yes pretty much everything is possible

615
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,879
well the future is certainly here at

616
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,158
least with wikidata thank you again lee

617
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,080

618
