4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,960
imagine a world

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,320
where the sum of all knowledge is

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,320
accessible for anyone

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,840
knowledge is being presented in so many

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,000
different ways

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,840
some of it is text and you can easily

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,399
access and skim through it

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,480
some of it you have to see and some of

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,480
it you have to touch and experience

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,760
we're having this remote experience

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,040
today right now

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,480
i'd love to be in leipzig with you or

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,960
together with you but we can't because

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,440
times are crazy and the digital world

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,079
at least makes it possible to gain

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,120
knowledge

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,000
on a different in a different way and of

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,440
course we at

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,600
wikimedia deutschland wikimedia

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,480
georgetown

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,479
we have we see that and we try to

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,518
provide good content for everyone we try

26
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,840
to

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,439
help the community of the wikisphere of

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,520
the wiki version

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,759
like in the wiki data community and the

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,158
wikipedia community or wikimedia commons

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,320
and so many more projects

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:23,759
to access great sources

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,439
to make its work in different contexts

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,680
to be able to remix knowledge

35
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,479
to put it to good use and to reach an

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,960
audience worldwide

37
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,920
it's been 20 years now and the wikipedia

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,720
has started

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,280
without much photos and there was even

40
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,798
even a

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,399
debate going on where the photos and

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,759
images are

43
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,960
um are good for the wikipedia

44
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,320
because um text you can easily edit and

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,360
anyone can do it

46
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,479
but photos and videos there's a there's

47
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,280
a whole different

48
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,479
approach and there's a whole more and

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,079
more more skills

50
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,000
to or other sets of skills to be able to

51
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,039
access and to edit it

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,878
and that makes it harder to um

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,840
to renew stuff and to adapt it

54
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,519
and but also to create it and the

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,640
communities and the volunteers

56
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,879
in the in the wikisphere they are

57
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,200
sometimes having a hard time to get

58
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,079
goods cgi's for example or to get good

59
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,359
graphics

60
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,760
to make those to make beautiful articles

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,440
and

62
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,799
to make good shows um they are not

63
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:38,079
always available it's it's costs

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,160
money the studio the equipment and

65
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:45,440
the graphics are producing and

66
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,440
there's already a lot of money spent on

67
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,840
producing that kind of content

68
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,480
and we want to you bring that to good

69
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,720
use

70
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,959
in wikipedia and in the other spheres

71
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,959
where we have been reaching out

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,159
uh we have been approached by the

73
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,239
community to

74
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,679
reach out to the public broadcasters and

75
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,480
that's what we did and this is our

76
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,200
journey

77
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,640
and i want to go on this together with

78
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,319
you a little bit of recap

79
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,440
and then a way of you to help us with

80
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,958
that with that

81
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,840
with that mission and to also reach out

82
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,959
and bring

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,159
good content into the public sphere to

84
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,440
really be able to help others and to

85
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:28,399
help educators in those crazy times

86
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,200
and uh yeah together make the sum of all

87
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,239
knowledge

88
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,359
available to anyone in different ways

89
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,000
not only texts but also videos

90
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,000
like this one

91
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,599
so the talk is called public service

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,599
public value and

93
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,200
sub line is uh when stars collide

94
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,200
there's a reason for that

95
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,760
um you know i could talk now about

96
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,119
how stars are going around each other

97
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,798
and they attract each other and they

98
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,239
then they come together and then there's

99
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,680
a bang and sometimes there's a neutron

100
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,680
star and then shooting

101
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,760
all kinds of crazy stuff out of it which

102
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,920
we can then measure here on earth

103
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,679
i could also show you this video and i

104
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,159
think the video uh

105
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,000
uh provided here with nasa content uh

106
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,798
would be a much better way

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,639
to approach this knowledge and the

108
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,599
beautiful thing about this not only

109
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,000
because it's

110
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,000
good stuff coming out of it and which

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,800
matches the talk but also that another

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,600
content is

113
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,880
not a copyright protected most of it

114
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,919
because it's provided by a federal

115
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,440
agency and says

116
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:37,198
u.s copyright law um

117
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,479
but also the ace as

118
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,919
a european space agency

119
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:46,560
it also now provides um content under

120
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,000
under a public or under an open license

121
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,280
which can be adapted

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,400
so we had

123
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,638
a big publicly funded agency the ether

124
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,560
which produced good content scientific

125
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,600
content which could be

126
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,759
used to or could be put to good use and

127
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,880
they decided actively decided

128
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,280
to adapt creative commons licensing to

129
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,600
adapt

130
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,280
open licenses so that people could do

131
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,880
good stuff with it

132
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,719
and um that's what we wanted the public

133
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,400
broadcasters to do as well

134
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,400
which was not an easy task

135
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,239
but we had great we had great

136
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,280
experiences in corporations and we're

137
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,840
working together

138
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,559
now really good the public broadcasters

139
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,080
in germany

140
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,400
are having a budget of about eight eight

141
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,199
million over eight billion euros per

142
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,000
annum

143
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:42,320
and they make content available online

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,639
well you can access it you can't really

145
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,479
download most of it you cannot remix it

146
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,919
which is a problem for educators

147
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,719
because remix is like the standard case

148
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,840
um everyday case for for teachers i used

149
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,880
to be a teacher

150
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,000
i took screenshots put them on papers

151
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,880
and uh build little quizzes out of stuff

152
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,919
or not used a whole broadcast but parts

153
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,120
of it

154
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,639
and um that's not really

155
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,759
how um how i can use public broadcast

156
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,440
most of the time

157
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,199
because it's it has all rights reserved

158
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,160
and i can just use it in a

159
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,039
non-commercial manner and

160
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,080
uh and there lies the first problem what

161
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,599
is non-commercial

162
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,599
when i'm teaching a public school okay

163
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,560
but when i'm teaching in the afternoon

164
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,120
uh to uh in kind of overtime paid by the

165
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,960
hour

166
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,840
um to do to help a student um privately

167
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,560
or when i'm having a blog or a website

168
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,679
and there's

169
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,319
uh there's advertisements on that to pay

170
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,800
or to pay the fees for the hosting is

171
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,639
this then

172
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:52,639
is do i then monitorize the content or

173
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,400
um if there's a if there's a pub

174
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,960
private partnership and the sponsoring

175
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,080
there if i'm putting it in student paper

176
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,680
and publishing it and then selling the

177
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,719
student paper because

178
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,960
prince printing stuff costs

179
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,400
is this that monetarized is this

180
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,239
commercial is it not

181
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,440
so there's a whole kind of worms right

182
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,720
there so

183
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,000
the the content that's provided by the

184
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,880
public broadcasters bottom line

185
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,240
is not usable for for any day use and

186
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,360
not usable for wikipedia

187
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,639
at least not for remix and republishing

188
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,960
issues um that's bad

189
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,160
and that's especially when there's 8

190
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,440
billion euros every

191
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,840
year going into those public

192
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:38,479
broadcasters let's

193
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:41,198
should be something we should engage in

194
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,719
now we approach them and in most cases

195
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,039
when you approach the

196
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,759
the lawyers of the public broadcasters

197
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,000
they say

198
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:52,160
well we'd like if you use that content

199
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,479
but if you are asking me for permission

200
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,240
to use that content in that specific

201
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:01,280
context i have to say no if you are if

202
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,120
you ask me i have to say no

203
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,280
and this is a situation right

204
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,840
there i mean you have someone who

205
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,479
provides

206
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,318
good non-fictional content which should

207
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,318
be used for educational use

208
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,240
he wants it to be used in that way

209
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,120
there's an educator who wants to use it

210
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,560
in that way

211
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,319
but we can come together because of

212
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,199
licensing policies

213
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,000
i know it's legally right but it still

214
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,520
feels wrong

215
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,639
and we could i am other than piracy

216
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,758
we can do something about it i mean

217
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,200
the content the public broadcasters

218
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,680
provide they are they are

219
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,599
editorially independent so they may be

220
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,478
publicly funded but that the politics

221
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,760
stay out of the

222
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,599
of the editorial uh process

223
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,120
so there may be some in the in the

224
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,760
supervisory boards

225
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,839
and um there's as a whole a debate going

226
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,040
on about that in germany for example

227
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,839
but the the editors are free and

228
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,160
there's good content produced and you

229
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,399
can

230
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,800
content you can trust on content where

231
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,760
there's there's a whole set of producers

232
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,640
behind it

233
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,360
who fact check and um who if they make a

234
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,480
mistake

235
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,160
um make it right again

236
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,000
the public broadcasters are not for

237
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,480
profit and

238
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,440
they want to provide public content or

239
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:22,880
as they call it public value

240
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:25,440
and i think we can help with that

241
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,000
we have this beautiful big platform

242
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,920
where

243
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,279
anyone who's searching for information

244
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,079
lands at some point

245
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,680
whether he's approaching it via via

246
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,000
speech assistance

247
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,880
which is then asking wikipedia or

248
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
wikidata

249
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,040
for information or whether he just

250
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,360
puts it into a search search box and

251
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,240
then

252
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,000
finds it and accesses for example the

253
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,760
text in wikipedia

254
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,880
um the content can be reused in all

255
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,279
kinds of manners

256
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,240
because it is public it is openly

257
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,040
licensed

258
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,600
like most likely with um so there's a

259
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,319
whole

260
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,800
range of licenses you can choose we

261
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,880
choose

262
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,719
the most open licenses of wikipedia

263
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,480
that's a community decision

264
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,680
um cc by cc by share alike or even cc0

265
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,600
um i won't go too deep into that but

266
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,800
just you just have to remember you can

267
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,959
use that content

268
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,279
you can remix it you can put it into

269
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,479
another content you have always have to

270
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,720
name the source although if it's not c0

271
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,320
you always have to name the source and

272
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,399
if you edit it

273
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,399
um you have to make that visible

274
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,800
yeah but the contents provided by the

275
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,800
public broadcasters in this case the id

276
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,959
which is a public broadcast in germany

277
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:48,160
is of course provided

278
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,719
are all rights reserved so you can do

279
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,000
a lot with it you can access it still

280
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,440
it's good stuff and there's a lot of

281
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,519
years in them in the media i think in

282
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,360
the end on youtube and stuff

283
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:03,040
but there is potential

284
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,440
and i'll show you why

285
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,040
um we had we had a campaign then it was

286
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,519
called public money public content you

287
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,360
may

288
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,600
uh see where this is coming from um

289
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,839
and we approached the public

290
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,680
broadcasters to work together on this

291
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,880
with the same argument i just made here

292
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,160
to you

293
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,680
um we in every step of the way we work

294
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,079
together with the community and with the

295
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,319
awesome people of wikileaks broadcast

296
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,319
and we are um

297
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,640
i'll come back to that in a minute so

298
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,640
first um some public broadcasters in

299
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,519
this case funk which is a cooperation

300
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,519
between the big

301
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,040
two big public broadcasters in germany

302
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,040
um

303
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,279
uh for um who are producing content for

304
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,599
young people and uh younger audiences

305
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,519
and they try to like summarize wikipedia

306
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,680
pages which is a problem

307
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,440
uh for the community because they say

308
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,920
well it's nice if you summarize it but

309
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,600
if the

310
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,160
article changes can we then change the

311
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,880
video no video editing is more expensive

312
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,639
and

313
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,320
you have to have certain programs for

314
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,440
that and skills uh that's

315
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,480
um i that fewer people have so there's a

316
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,880
little um

317
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,279
a smaller community to do it so

318
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,839
that's that's not content we really can

319
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,800
use on wikipedia

320
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,600
although the videos were quite um they

321
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,000
were quite

322
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,000
high quality they were rejected by the

323
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,600
wikipedia community

324
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,639
we came together in best phase faith

325
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,519
but this just didn't work out as

326
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,519
it sometimes does

327
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,920
next try was to provide pictures

328
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,959
of of people in this

329
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,319
case there was there was a reportage

330
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:51,760
a portrait of of of an actor

331
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,240
or actress in this case and uh they put

332
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,399
that

333
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,399
in in wikimedia commons so that it could

334
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,200
be used for channels on wikipedia and it

335
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,160
was

336
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,600
used in several pages and also on pages

337
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,760
all over the internet

338
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,360
always with a little mark that the

339
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,160
content was provided by the public

340
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,600
broadcaster

341
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,079
which is fine but um

342
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,360
community uh or some community members

343
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,479
and said well this

344
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,440
photo is well too good to be publicly

345
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,760
licensed

346
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,240
so there's a whole other kind of worms

347
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,279
and another problem right there

348
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,399
we overcame that um with

349
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:31,279
um with a great pilot

350
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,800
project uh who which i want to talk

351
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,240
about right now and if you are listening

352
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,599
in a public broadcast

353
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,320
or working together with public

354
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,760
broadcasters somewhere in the world

355
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:45,199
you should know be very interested um

356
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:49,199
because what we achieved here is

357
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:52,719
public is openly licensed content

358
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:56,240
being reused on all sorts of sites

359
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,040
we cannot track everything but

360
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,360
we can track what we already did like in

361
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,160
the

362
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,120
in the own mediatek in the in the on

363
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,680
channels of the

364
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,399
of the cdf and on the youtube channels

365
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,839
and stuff

366
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:12,639
we can see how often this this

367
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,959
content was approached and was used we

368
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,920
can

369
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:18,479
track how much it was used in wikipedia

370
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,160
and how often it was clicked on

371
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,560
and we can guess because it has been

372
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,399
cope or it has been published as well

373
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,119
because provided under free and open

374
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,839
license

375
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,240
on shul server and stuff like that as so

376
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,199
on

377
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,680
networks for schools and on servers that

378
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,199
provide

379
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:40,479
educational content and we can see

380
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,880
that it's being adapted there and that

381
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,519
the community the educational community

382
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,000
really wants to do things with it and is

383
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,600
putting it to good use

384
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,040
how much come to that in a minute

385
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,160
um first

386
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:01,920
the cdf started with a

387
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:05,279
with climates and environmentally

388
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,920
connected content um to and

389
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,360
provided a material from there so they

390
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,160
came together with the producers with

391
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,600
the editors

392
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,839
with everyone involved in the process

393
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,800
and they said um in cooperation with us

394
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,480
we also

395
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,199
gave some hints maybe um we cannot

396
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,120
give the whole episode of telex which is

397
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,959
big beautiful and very expensive

398
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,120
and has a lot of third-party content

399
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,880
into the public domain

400
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:35,360
or into licenses openly

401
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,000
um it's just too expensive and not

402
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,160
really

403
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,399
um it we cannot really do that but

404
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,079
there are some con there's some content

405
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,639
inside these episodes

406
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,000
which is built or which is produced

407
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,600
completely in-house

408
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,959
uh which we can which we can

409
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,240
target and which we can buy

410
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,839
the licenses for without straining our

411
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,040
budget too much

412
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,279
so videos cgi's

413
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,480
short pieces that are being produced

414
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,959
anyways

415
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,160
that just have to be licensed under a cc

416
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,920
license as well

417
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,920
and then upload it into wikimedia

418
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,479
commons so this was the way to go for

419
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,399
the cdf and for the terra x

420
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,560
team and they did it

421
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,519
and they put a lot of videos there which

422
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,719
was then

423
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,920
adapted by uh the community uh the

424
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,959
wikipedia community so they

425
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,240
um the cdf didn't do any editing in the

426
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,359
wikipedia they just

427
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,680
gave their input their

428
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,880
content to the comments and then there

429
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,199
was good stuff happening

430
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,160
by the community they adapted it and put

431
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,758
it into

432
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,079
mostly german speaking because of course

433
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,160
it's german videos german speaking

434
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,120
wikipedia german language wikipedia

435
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,680
articles

436
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,959
also some english english wikipedia

437
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,519
articles

438
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,319
um but there was also another another

439
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,160
beautiful

440
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,839
thing happening as you can see right

441
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,959
here

442
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,360
they also did now it started to do

443
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,199
redux and because they saw it's good

444
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,000
it's high quality content we can build

445
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,039
upon that

446
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,959
we can remix it and we can read up it

447
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:19,839
in dutch in welsh in esperanto

448
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,880
and we can put subtitles on there in

449
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,000
latin

450
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:28,559
and in dutch and catalan

451
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and in spanish so

452
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:35,200
this content is now free

453
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and is evolving and it's good

454
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,520
high quality non-fictional mostly

455
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,559
scientific content

456
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:46,080
that helps the wikipedia communities

457
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:49,600
to further reach their audience to help

458
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:53,280
provide knowledge to everyone even if

459
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,600
you're maybe visually impaired or

460
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,440
mentally impaired or you just don't want

461
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,039
to read the long text right now because

462
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,360
the head is buzzing and there's not

463
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,520
enough coffee in the world

464
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,399
and you can just watch a video to maybe

465
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,039
grasp

466
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,640
the the idea of this specific article or

467
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,400
this as this paragraph there

468
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,760
a little better it's another way of

469
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,559
providing information and it works

470
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,840
together like a charm

471
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,639
and we can see that also by the numbers

472
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,240
um on which those files are approached

473
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,320
so we tried first to

474
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,280
do a page view analysis so we put all

475
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,678
the content

476
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,720
we we monitored and which sides is the

477
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,039
content

478
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:35,200
implemented in or embedded in and then

479
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,240
tried to measure the as a viewership of

480
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,840
the of the pages

481
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,880
which didn't really work because there

482
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,000
was a and now it's over 120 files and we

483
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,120
cannot really reproduce

484
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,320
that we also tried to do a media view

485
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,799
counter

486
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,360
which also then strained at some point

487
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,080
it

488
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,360
it exceeded the limitations of the tools

489
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,159
we were having

490
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,479
to measure that as soon as the files

491
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,679
were too many so we could like do

492
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,520
um a direct comparison of files how

493
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,520
they're performing how they're doing

494
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,918
um but we couldn't really track all of

495
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,360
them so then a great colleague of mine

496
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,360
uh he amir he built this

497
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,879
beautiful media views too so that you

498
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,600
can uh really

499
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,400
monitor a whole category so we can

500
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,120
monitor

501
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,720
how often the files in the category of

502
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,360
terax

503
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,640
provided videos um you see the short

504
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,280
link right there bits

505
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,080
dot lee slash terra x30 so the last 30

506
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,879
days

507
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,080
of usage of terrax content from

508
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,000
wikimedia commons

509
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:41,199
um and we can see a monthly usage

510
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,320
of over a million views which

511
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,880
is a lot because this is not just some

512
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,039
someone randomly browsing and finding

513
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,600
this video on this and it's an autoplay

514
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,559
but searching for information on the

515
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,678
topic

516
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:58,639
uh like as a taj mahal or

517
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,120
like the the harbor of catago or

518
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,480
something like that

519
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,719
um or covet vaccine and

520
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,400
then they're clicking on the article

521
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,039
they're clicking on the video

522
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,919
embedded in the article and view it and

523
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,720
this is a

524
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,559
very qualified encounter right there and

525
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,840
this happens over a million times with

526
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,520
the content that the teddy f has

527
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,600
provided now

528
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:27,120
every month and still growing

529
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,520
and the that's good in several ways

530
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,678
first

531
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,039
it's great for the community because

532
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,679
they can

533
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,720
more easily reach their audience and

534
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,960
they can help the

535
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,880
audience understand the topic better it

536
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,720
makes wikipedia more beautiful

537
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,799
for the audience of course we just

538
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,320
talked about that and also for the

539
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,918
for the content provider because of

540
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,960
course the content is branded there's a

541
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,640
little logo in there

542
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,880
and it's called videos provided by

543
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,080
herrex i have stated the

544
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:57,200
on the brand a few times now

545
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,480
and um of course anyone who

546
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,280
uses it has to quote the cdf and telex

547
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,320
at that point it has to give attribution

548
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:09,280
which is good for the brand and

549
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,320
makes it more makes it more likely that

550
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,440
at

551
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,120
some other point when you're searching

552
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,000
for information on the topic you'll be

553
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,039
circling back

554
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,960
to the two tex for example and hopefully

555
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:22,559
to wikipedia

556
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,919
um but there's more

557
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:29,678
um we have done some

558
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:33,039
high-level uh high-level roundtables

559
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,520
where we brought together

560
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,360
unions teachers unions as well as

561
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,440
journalists unions as well as young

562
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,840
journalists

563
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,039
people who work in research and in

564
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,080
universities um

565
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,840
library organizations and of course the

566
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,039
wikipedia community

567
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,158
um to see how we better can work

568
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,960
together and what

569
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,000
we can do and how we can monitor it and

570
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,240
what is likely to

571
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,919
be done and what not um because of

572
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,440
course also the public broadcasters have

573
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,559
wishes for the community and for we can

574
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,080
be dead at heartland

575
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:10,639
and as well as the other way around uh

576
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,199
our main arguments here are that it's

577
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,480
it's

578
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,520
improves the public good it has it has

579
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,360
um it saves taxes if schools public

580
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,000
schools don't have to buy

581
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,879
additional video content for example

582
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,440
they can

583
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,080
but can use the content that is already

584
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,600
publicly

585
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,600
funded for free um it strengthens the

586
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,039
cooperation between different spheres of

587
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,199
making knowledge available

588
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,440
and it's um further helping them

589
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,200
reaching their audience

590
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,799
and exactly the platforms that they're

591
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,400
searching for on

592
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,918
that they're searching for information

593
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,320
on

594
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,520
so as i said our campaign was called

595
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,439
public money public good

596
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,799
and there were some reactions and we had

597
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,159
some great corporations

598
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,639
coming after that i not on this

599
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,320
point have to um thank all the

600
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,720
stakeholders that supported the campaign

601
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,480
not only the cars communication club

602
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,840
cars computer club but also the

603
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,520
libraries association the teachers

604
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,199
associations in germany

605
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,639
and kiron university and some others

606
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,320
that you can see there if you're a

607
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,600
stakeholder on an international level

608
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,840
and want to join

609
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,360
this uh this claim for more content

610
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,840
provided by the public broadcasters

611
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,559
reach out to me

612
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,240
bandpointfieldwikimedia.com

613
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,399
and we can talk about it or maybe after

614
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,039
that in the q and a

615
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,760
so we wrote a lot of letters there were

616
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,000
a center

617
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,840
ten thousand little postcards uh being

618
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,760
sent to the public broadcasters where

619
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,600
anyone could put a little comment i want

620
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,120
to use that because

621
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,120
and there were a lot of educators

622
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,199
teachers and um

623
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,320
yeah knowledge workers who reached out

624
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,279
to us and said

625
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,240
finally i wanted to use or i have used

626
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,480
in a limited way

627
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,000
the content already and there's so much

628
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,880
more and so much better stuff i want to

629
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,200
do with it

630
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,960
i want to screenshot it and put it on

631
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,080
the paper and then build a chris out

632
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,799
quiz out of it

633
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,000
whatever and there are the limitations

634
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,400
of copyright and

635
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,240
the creative commons licensing makes it

636
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,919
easier for me

637
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,000
um also the ideas the second or

638
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,000
another really big public broadcast in

639
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,840
germany also tried to adapt

640
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,559
creative commons licensing they did even

641
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,039
with their most important broadcasts

642
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,000
like target show which is the common

643
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,200
news broadcast for

644
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,440
for every german um they they are

645
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,960
providing graphics and short videos

646
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,960
under creative commons

647
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:36,240
and ncnd so none for commercial and

648
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,919
no variations stuff um so

649
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:42,000
at least it is available indefinitely

650
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,880
now so it can be linked upon and it can

651
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,120
be used in

652
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:49,039
certain ways especially in in schools

653
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,399
but you cannot really use on wikipedia

654
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,320
right now they also

655
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,679
put some podcasts like the coronavirus

656
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,320
update which is like

657
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,200
one of the most listened to podcasts

658
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,720
right now

659
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:04,080
um a scientific podcast here in germany

660
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,279
under cc license which is also a great a

661
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,639
great step

662
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:11,520
and um there's a reason why they

663
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,000
where they are hesitant to put content

664
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,760
under

665
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,360
more open license not only because of

666
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,720
licensing issues and

667
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,879
because of the money you have to you

668
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,080
have to originally pay for it but also

669
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:26,080
in fear of uh there's uh there's some

670
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,320
um yes some users that they don't want

671
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,520
in our experience though we see that on

672
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,039
the ttf content

673
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,639
there's a lot of good stuff happening

674
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:36,240
with it and

675
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,799
none of the fears were

676
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,760
matched um none of the fears really came

677
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,799
true

678
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,720
um they're there there are adaptations

679
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,840
and there are read ups but they are good

680
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,960
they are in in

681
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,520
the way we would have wanted it and

682
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,320
um sometimes you just have to take a

683
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,320
leap of faith

684
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,559
and see good stuff happening right as of

685
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,080
right now the licensing policies

686
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:03,600
and the public broadcasters they

687
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,158
make so the bad stuff's happening anyway

688
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,080
people will steal it will adapt it will

689
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,880
put little horns on people's heads and

690
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,000
whatever

691
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,320
and they don't really care about

692
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,159
copyright um which

693
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,439
also would not be possible with creative

694
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,360
commons because um

695
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,480
there's uh there's limitations to that

696
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,600
to the license you're given with

697
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,679
creative commons and

698
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,279
putting it in a context where it's not

699
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,360
is not right

700
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,960
is one of that those limitations but

701
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,158
whatever

702
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,279
but creative commons makes the uses you

703
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,240
want to give

704
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,960
you want to make possible possible

705
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,159
available

706
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,320
and this all very very much cheaply and

707
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,600
there will be stuff coming out uh from

708
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,000
the idea i hope

709
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,158
as of now there are this is the chair of

710
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,880
the id of the big public broadcast in

711
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,159
germany

712
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,840
and they say it's like it's a

713
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,400
cornerstone so it's important building

714
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,600
block

715
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,559
on which where how to make our content

716
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,600
available

717
00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:00,000
indefinitely as possible and

718
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,279
easily as accessible as possible even

719
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,880
this press release though

720
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,000
you see on the photo right there there's

721
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,840
all rights reserved says this is

722
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,960

which i quote here um

724
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,559
so way to go but there's good stuff

725
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,918
there's good faith i have good faith and

726
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,600
there's a lot of good will on all

727
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,960
institutions and we're working together

728
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,199
by the to that

729
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,480
to that common goal there's also a

730
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,600
global task force

731
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,640
of uh public broadcasters um like

732
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,480
uh and they're saying um we share the

733
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,520
common duty on form educate and

734
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,120
entertain

735
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:37,120
um the engagement with audiences of all

736
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,158
ages across a range of broadcast and

737
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,039
online services

738
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,679
wikipedia is critical to our success in

739
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,158
serving them

740
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,760
whenever wherever and however they want

741
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,120
and to reach that dear public

742
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,360
broadcasters all around the world

743
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,320
whether you're the npr or the nhk the

744
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,360
pbs

745
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,639
bbc the area a cbc

746
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,639

possible

750
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,600
it should be paid fairly it should be

751
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,320
accessible

752
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,760
everywhere and it should be accessible

753
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,399
anytime

754
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,200
and then we can build upon it and

755
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,520
there's

756
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,480
all kinds of good stuff shooting out of

757
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,320
it

758
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,320
and we can measure that now

759
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:29,520
so our mission

760
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,240
is clear and there's a lot of good

761
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,440
people

762
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,320
working together on all sides to make it

763
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,760
possible

764

broadcasting studios do but

807
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,399
or twitter with the hashtag rc3

808
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,918
wikipakka

809
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,239
we're listening to all of them and we'll

810
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,320
relate them to our speaker here

811
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,279
you had an interesting slide uh at the

812
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,720
end of your talk you're

813
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,559
towards the end of your talk with tom

814
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,320
burrow who

815
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,678
was stating something along the lines of

816
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,918
cc licenses are

817
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,360
an important part of what the public

818
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,480
broadcasting institutions in germany are

819
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,719
doing and

820
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,399
at the very bottom right you you made me

821
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,399
aware of that i didn't even see it first

822
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,239
that there was an all rights reserved

823
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:45,360
clause this looks for me like

824
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,320
there is a cultural cultural obstacle

825
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,639
still to be

826
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,240
to be surmounted to be surpassed is

827
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,039
there any hope that this cultural change

828
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,559
is taking

829
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:57,840
taking place yes

830
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:01,360
okay okay

831
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,600
how would you say well it's really not

832
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,600
easy

833
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:10,159
they are buying licenses and then

834
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,880
they can do a limited a little bit

835
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,000
limited

836
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:17,760
um limited stuff with it and they are

837
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,399
now they have a lot of contracts and

838
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,760
if you have a big ship like like the

839
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,320
idea of the cdf

840
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,720
you have all kinds of standard contracts

841
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,840
and you have to change those first

842
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:33,840
before you can do anything so that's a

843
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,600
chicken and egg problem the authors say

844
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,879
we can't because they are not the

845
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,480
contracts are not there

846
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:43,200
so i can't waive any rights and the and

847
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,760
the public broadcasters say well the

848
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,159
authors

849
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,679
wouldn't agree to it so we don't have

850
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:51,120
the contracts yet

851
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,960
um and there's a big cultural change

852
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,959
going on right now there's a lot of

853
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,080
reduction a lot of editors a lot of

854
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,760
content creators

855
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,120
who want to try out stuff who are

856
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,960
reaching out to us but it takes time

857
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,439
because it's a big wheel we're trying to

858
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,519
turn here and big wheels take time to

859
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,399
start journey

860
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,840
well 2020 has uh taught us to be patient

861
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,879
and wait for changes but

862
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,120
there might be some people in the

863
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,200
audience who don't want to wait and and

864
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,799
what you what you told me about these

865
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,360
standard contracts

866
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,158
sounds awfully familiar um for people

867
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,760
who work in

868
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,679
who work with public administrations who

869
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,158
have who are facing similar

870
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,519
problems with subcontractors and and

871
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,480
people depend upon

872
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,200
and one way that has been shown in that

873
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,600
realm

874
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,799
would be to to provide boilerplate

875
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,719
licenses that the

876
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:42,639
the institutions can actually use and

877
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:45,840
reuse has anybody tried that

878
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,600
um yeah well they

879
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,959
they are using creative commons right

880
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,199
now but

881
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,200
um

882
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,879
i think um what what

883
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,279
exactly do you mean with boilerplate

884
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,039
licenses yeah yeah of course i mean uh

885
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,279
creative commons is of course a

886
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,600
boilerplate license for sub licensing

887
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,720
but you told me about um as far as i

888
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,840
understand that

889
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,240
the public broadcasting institutions use

890
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,918
subcontractors to

891
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,679
to actually produce their contents and

892
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,840
they would have to to

893
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,880
enter contracts and new licenses that

894
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,279
permit

895
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,080
sub licensing under creative commons

896
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:23,120
clauses

897
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,158
so if somebody let's say wikimedia or

898
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,918
some other instance

899
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,440
but to provide the public broadcasters

900
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,880
with boilerplate licenses for their

901
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,720
subcontractors wouldn't that be an

902
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,760
option

903
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,840
uh if we

904
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,440
not you want to not to want to drop the

905
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,240
hot potato in your lap but

906
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,600
we can't we can't look that far into the

907
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,279
into the crown type prisoners of the

908
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,158
public broadcasters and their sub

909
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,840
subcontractors but um this is exactly

910
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,519
where how terrax

911
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,199
did it in the end so they haven't

912
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,200
they're having a subcontractor

913
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,519
and at the very beginning of the of the

914
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,880
um process of the broadcasting process

915
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,600
and production process

916
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,240
they said well let's try this and we

917
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,639
will

918
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,080
take some of some of the stuff and

919
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,000
release it under creative commons are

920
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,319
you all right with that

921
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,560
um on an in an ongoing production and

922
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,800
most contracts are already set and you

923
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,759
always go back to the same contractor

924
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,560
um uh you can't really do that or that's

925
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,960
that's hard

926
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,440
you just you need an outside impulse for

927
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,280
that and that's why the audience comes

928
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:28,639
comes into play because i bet all of you

929
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:31,839
have a as a loved podcast

930
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,440
or some uh some broadcast that's

931
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,759
that you see but at the public

932
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,000
broadcasters and you want to

933
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,440
bring to the comments or content you

934
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,199
want to bring into the comments

935
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,119
and of course you can reach out to the

936
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,239
broadcaster you can reach out to the

937
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,240
redaction

938
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,158
and say we want to do that and we want

939
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,078
to see that in the comments why isn't it

940
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,599
and then they have to ask the legal

941
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,200
people and the legal people then

942
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,159
sometimes consult with us

943
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,200
and then we can try to do something um

944
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,920
so

945
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,720
it's big wheels but many many small

946
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,800
angles where you can attack

947
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,959
that sounds like a call to action for me

948
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,760
um people who are watching right now and

949
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,440
listening right now

950
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,119
where would they direct such questions

951
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,800
and questions would they just

952
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,800
add set df or add or depress or whatever

953
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,960
on twitter or is there any way that is

954
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,880
uh more impactful maybe send a fax or

955
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,079
something like that

956
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,520
you know what do that right now right

957
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:29,440
now during this q a

958
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,520
you can add cdf and id to do just that

959
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,200
and there are people there watching that

960
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,599
they're watching it and the more

961
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,319
impulses they're cut they are the more

962
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,440
likely

963
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,320
they will be moving but also uh

964
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,880
standard email they are read like every

965
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,240
program

966
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,480
that every input from from audiences is

967
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,439
being read at the public broadcasters

968
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,079
offices

969
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,440
so just type an email and say i love

970
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,040
your content why isn't it creative

971
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,240
comments

972
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:02,160
cheers and and there you go

973
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:04,160
this is um this helps us a lot and

974
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,680
it helps the people inside the houses

975
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,720
inside the public broadcasters

976
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,480
who really want to get things going but

977
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,560
they are also the ones who say

978
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,839
we don't really need to change that do

979
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:17,119
we but

980
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:18,720
you and us we have to show them that the

981
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,040
future lies in creative commons

982
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,399
licensing and an open licensing

983
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,640
and not just uh getting on with

984
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,040
not providing open content and deleting

985
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,920
stuff that is good and that could have

986
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,000
been reused

987
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,160
if only it would have been licensed

988
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,599
correctly

989
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,520
okay so we are not screaming into the

990
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,280
void but we have allies within the

991
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,680
broadcasting authorities that really

992
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,720
want our help actually is that true

993
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,040
it is and there are a lot of people

994
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,839
doing the hard work uh my i mean my job

995
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,200
is easy i'm for

996
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,640
i'm sitting at the outside and saying

997
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,759
why don't you why couldn't you all that

998
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,000
would be a good idea

999
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,079
and they are confronted with all the

1000
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,720
people who know the ifs and whence and

1001
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,119
who always say no because and they're

1002
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,399
finding

1003
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:05,359
reasons why this shouldn't be

1004
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,960
possible but we are now going on from

1005
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,520
the production level

1006
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,599
because the the content providers they

1007
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,800
want their products and their content to

1008
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,240
be remixed

1009
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,000
we are also going from the political

1010
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,000
level because that's important at the

1011
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,480
public broadcasters obviously

1012
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,079
um and we're going on from the internet

1013
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,920
so from the chair level

1014
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:28,480
and um i mean everyone

1015
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,079
working at the id and cdf there there's

1016
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,079
a little bit

1017
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,280
um if they try something new they can

1018
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,920
fail and they can

1019
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,359
get smacked over the head uh with people

1020
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,720
who are who are angry at them

1021
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,560
because there are so many angry people

1022
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,279
out there that which

1023
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,240
who attack the the property broadcasters

1024
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,480
all the time

1025
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,479
and if they see that it works at one

1026
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,880
public worker so like at the cdf

1027
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,640
it's very much more likely that another

1028
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,599
public broadcaster will also

1029
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,520
uh try that try out that course of

1030
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,599
action

1031
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,440
well this is really close a little bit

1032
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,880
mikado

1033
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,800
that's that's right that rings very

1034
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,720
close to our heart because i mean we do

1035
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,560
have our wgf alpha

1036
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,560
knight program and we would have loved

1037
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,400
to include banter sport in that

1038
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,960
so for all the people who are right now

1039
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,720
composing tweets

1040
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,640
well maybe in the future and uh

1041
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,959
maybe we're depending on all the people

1042
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,759
composing tweets right now at zf

1043
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,599
uh for all the activists who are well

1044
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,400
who do have experience with uh mass

1045
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,800
mailing

1046
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,760
members of parliament um they actually

1047
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,560
they

1048
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,240
they they know that mass mails that

1049
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,400
follow a template are

1050
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,520
well um not as not as impactful as

1051
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,640
individual letters

1052
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,880
so is it is it a detriment if they

1053
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,680
include in their in their tweet the

1054
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,560
oogie

1055
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,759
hashtag or uh any any other campaigns

1056
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,759
campaign model

1057
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,359
is the germans the german slogan for

1058
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,920
earth for public money public content

1059
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:01,839
openly

1060
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:04,240
skilled openly he's good

1061
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,880
yeah well you can do that so we can we

1062
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,959
can

1063
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,880
monitor it a little bit and see who else

1064
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,520
is interested in that you can also reach

1065
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,079
out to the

1066
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,079
um to the wikileaks broadcast group in

1067
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,720
wikipedia

1068
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,480
they're a group of activists who have

1069
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,200
experience in that and who are

1070
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,800
standing by to help public broadcasters

1071
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,359
understand the wikipedia

1072
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,920
and to see whether and where the content

1073
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,680
fits

1074
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,280
so there's a lot of ways to engage in

1075
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,078
that and if you

1076
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,920
and if you have um ideas for that or

1077
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,640
just questions you can reach out to me

1078

uh you you have my address that's a

1080
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,959

there's good stuff we wanted we want to

1087
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,040

1088
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,599
let's make it possible together i

1089
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,320
need help that sounds like a call to

1090
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,280
action

1091
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,960
in the in the um background background

1092
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,520
chat we had before we went live

1093
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,000
you mentioned something about um the big

1094
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,040
the big

1095
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,599
how you say the big gulf of um

1096
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,880
of material that's already been produced

1097
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,280
and it's in a kind of

1098
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,560
legal limbo that is not so easily

1099
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,680
released right now

1100
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,839
can you tell a little bit more about

1101
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,839
that

1102
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:25,839
um i think i'm send us the question

1103
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,839
there

1104
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,240
i mean we have a similar situation in

1105
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,000
the united states um

1106
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,078
with with works that have published that

1107
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,400
have been published after the 1920s

1108
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,200
where copyright laws has been made more

1109
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,359
stringent

1110
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,040
and the original creators can't be

1111
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:43,920
contacted anymore yeah

1112
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,759
yeah that um we have two courses of

1113
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,040
action that the public broadcasters are

1114
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,720
trying right now

1115
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,560
i mean if you have if you're sitting on

1116
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,919
a on a treasure box

1117
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:57,359
you want to open it up and share it

1118
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:00,640
if it doesn't get less less words

1119
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,160
as well um so the idea is trying to

1120
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,960
provide content that they already have

1121
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,920
produced

1122
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,680
but uh clearing the rights for that

1123
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,720
stuff that's already is produced

1124
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,440
is a pain and yes and it's really it's

1125
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,640
really hard

1126
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,160
um and sometimes impossible to reach

1127
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,799
every creator who was uh

1128
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,560
who was connected with the production so

1129
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,680
everything that is in the past

1130
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,040
is kind of lost for our goal

1131
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,279
for creative commons licensing

1132
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,079
especially stuff that's being produced

1133
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,480
that has been released after 1970 or so

1134
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,400
um

1135
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,560
so they are opening up their archives

1136
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,760
and that's that's really a treasure

1137
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,839
for wikipedia um they can then pro

1138
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,880
they can then link to it and they can at

1139
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,680
least access it

1140
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,520
definitely um but the other cause of

1141
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,040
action seems to me much more

1142
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:52,000
um yeah much more sustainable to see in

1143
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,640
in which new productions from now on we

1144
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,359
can

1145
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,078
implement creative commons licensing and

1146
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,720
uh so

1147
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,680
that we can only look and walk into the

1148
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,598
future

1149
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,799
here although i'd love to see all the

1150
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,240
good stuff i've been

1151
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:13,119
seeing on the air already to to become

1152
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,118
creative commons but that's really hard

1153
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,319
well not to end on on a

1154
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,440
dystopic no but to go forth with the

1155
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,599
utopias

1156
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,119
there is a way to to open at least the

1157
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,200
the future releases and

1158
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,960
