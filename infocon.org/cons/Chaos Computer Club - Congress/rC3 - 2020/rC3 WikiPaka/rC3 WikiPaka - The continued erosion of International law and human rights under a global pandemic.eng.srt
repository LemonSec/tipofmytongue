cases in

71
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,480
[Music]

2019 and they and this is a photo

pearson international airport in toronto

77
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:19,840
on march

78
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,840
24 2018

79
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:28,720
um a year ago i talked about the

80
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,839
decline in human rights around the globe

81
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,959
nothing has changed since a year ago and

82
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,080
with the

83
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,959
covet 19 global pandemic things have

84
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,879
just gotten a lot worse

85
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,680
governments have been empowered

86
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,679
emboldened to

87
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,120
to continue to attack uh

88
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,519
those who dissent who cre who are

89
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,879
critical of government around the world

90
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,560
um and what has made matters worse are

91
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,000
the people's inability to go out and

92
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,799
exercise their rights of freedom of

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,799
expression

94
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,519
association and assembly and protests

95
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,000
because of covid

96
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,799
and for public public safety reasons and

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,120
the government has

98
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:16,880
has used that to their advantage to

99
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,478
abuse civilians in society

100
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,120
the media as well has been consumed in

101
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,320
my view

102
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,600
by the global pandemic as well as other

103
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,919
significant global news stories such as

104
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,880
the us elections and donald trump

105
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,840
what this has done is it's taken uh the

106
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,080
media away

107
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,400
journalists away from other important

108
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,520
human rights stories around the world

109
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,280
so so those who

110
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,880
whose cases or their circumstances are

111
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,320
not high profile

112
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,600
a lot of these stories are not being

113
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,199
reported anymore they're not being

114
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,240
investigated anymore which is

115
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,960
adding to governments

116
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,560
uh being aware that they can continue to

117
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,280
commit human rights violations around

118
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,080
the world

119
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,080
with impunity

120
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,840
um now i have a client from

121
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:11,198
origin from somalia he's a journalist

122
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,198
and i'm introducing him

123
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,639
to the public in this presentation

124
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,919
because

125
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,280
he fled persecution uh as a general

126
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,120
journalist in somalia

127
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,559
and he found himself in hong kong for a

128
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,840
period of time

129
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,880
in an untenable such uh situation

130
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,719
and had later found his way to the

131
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,880
european union to seek refugee status

132
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,840
there and i'd like to go into that

133
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,360
um and basically

134
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,719
um mr ibrahim

135
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,240
uh had covered new stories in mogadishu

136
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,240
and in and across somalia

137
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,919
and he was targeted by both the

138
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,160
government

139
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,840
and al-shabab um it was a situation that

140
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,759
geeky has and there's two quotes here

141
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,119
which i'll read out

142
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,319
which really encapsulate the

143
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,319
circumstances on the ground

144
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,159
ibrahim has stated in the morning we

145
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,199
hugged our family like we might never

146
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,199
see them again

147
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,639
because every day in mogadishu

148
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,120
journalists may be

149
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,479
killed in the cross fire or murdered by

150
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,400
al-shabab

151
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,159
and he also stated for a big story we

152
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,599
would bring two or three cameramen to

153
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,639
record the scene together

154
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,759
in case one was wounded or shot um as

155
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,280
as a lawyer for for uh ibrahim

156
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,960
i've actually seen footage that they've

157
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,638
recorded of

158
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,840
you know people on the front lines they

159
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,240
were with being shot dead

160
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,239
and and

161
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,400
this is a horrific situation for any

162
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,239
journalist to be in

163
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,239
and to report in um

164
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,039
the situation for ibrahim came to a

165
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,400
crossroads in 2009 when he was kidnapped

166
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,318
by al-shabab

167
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,679
he'd been targeted by the government as

168
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,280
well the police and also

169
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,599
officers of the ministry of information

170
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,159
and culture it was al-shabab who grabbed

171
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,039
him

172
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,240
tortured him threatened him to kill him

173
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,039
with a knife

174
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,880
a gun to his head and demanded a ransom

175
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,880
of 18 000 u.s which fortunately his

176
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,919
family was able to

177
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:16,400
secure and after six days as a hostage

178
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:18,719
he was released

179
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,799
now ibrahim had worked for universal

180
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:26,000
television

181
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:28,479
in somalia during two periods and

182
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,599
he had fled somalia for a period of time

183
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,719
to try to

184
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,520
find refuge in another part of africa

185
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,160
which didn't work and then tried again

186
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,240
where he found himself in south sudan

187
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,800
which was there's no durable solution

188
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,599
there for him so in september 2013 he

189
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,919
fled to hong kong

190
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,120
and he sought asylum there his thinking

191
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,719
was that hong kong

192
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,160
had a reputation of civility and

193
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,160
rule of law but upon his arrival he

194
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,599
you know he realized that he had been

195
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,280
seriously mistaken

196
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,199
uh immediately he was arrested and

197
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,318
detained at the calif

198
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,000
bay immigration center for short we call

199
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,120
that cic

200
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,199
and it's basically hong kong's version

201
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,520
of a gulag

202
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,360
and there's a an award-winning human

203
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,919
rights story by olivia chang from hong

204
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,319
kong

205
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,599
called the invisible wall i've provided

206
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,840
the link on the slides

207
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,080
so you'll be able to to read an english

208
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,679
version of that that story

209
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,359
now after being locked up for three

210
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,080
months he was released

211
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,680
on recognizance which is um he's

212
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,320
provided with a paper that typically

213
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,478
foreign criminals are provided with and

214
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,839
on the outside he faced destitution and

215
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,839
racial discrimination

216
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,360
and he was constantly racially profiled

217
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,480
by the police

218
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,959
stopped all the time threatened and hong

219
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,399
kong

220
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,000
society itself just basically

221
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,640
ignored him it's like it's as if he

222
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,279
didn't uh exist

223
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,319
he had no food or money for the five

224
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,760
months after

225
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,000
he had been released from detention and

226
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,319
uh international social services a swiss

227
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,519
organization with a branch in hong kong

228
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,200
provides humanitarian assistance

229
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,640
as a contractor for the hong kong social

230
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,640
welfare department

231
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,160
but still for five months he was

232
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,360
destitute no food

233
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,360
and no money

234
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,760
and in 2013 uh my slide there's an error

235
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,480
it says 2014 but in late 2013

236
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,200
um ibrahim showed up at my office with

237
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,040
another

238
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,160
um one of his colleagues

239
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,640
who had worked for him in somalia

240
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,680
and uh they had they were wearing

241
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,080
bedroom slippers

242
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,719
and uh used clothing and they they were

243
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,880
starving

244
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,200
and uh i immediately took up their cases

245
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,560
with the unhcr in hong kong

246
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,760
and subsequent to that

247
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,719
that meeting in my office my wife

248
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,240
took both of them down to out of her own

249
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,839
pocket to purchase shoes for them

250
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,040
running shoes and also to buy them some

251
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,200
food

252
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,360
now geeky is what i would describe as a

253
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,640
victim of constructive refund and i'm

254
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,399
going to go into the law on that in a

255
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,720
few minutes but basically

256
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,160
the hong kong government has a legal

257
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,040
policy framework

258
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,800
that's designed to break down the mental

259
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,760
health and physical health of asylum

260
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,040
seekers

261
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:29,439
um basically through social isola iso

262
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:31,680
isolation and deprivation of

263
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,560
sufficient humanitarian assistance so

264
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,479
that they don't starve

265
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,279
and cheeky described a situation a few

266
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,360
days ago

267
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,279
looking back after the asylum seeking

268
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,920
community protested and occupied social

269
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,279
welfare

270
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,120
and international social services

271
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,880
offices in 2014

272
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,640
protesting not having enough food or

273
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,399
rent money to survive it felt like my

274
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,399
mind was breaking i felt i would die in

275
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,480
hong kong

276
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,600
abraham's mental and physical health

277
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,320
declined in hong kong to the point where

278
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,120
it was a choice between not surviving in

279
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,240
hong kong

280
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,640
or um you know trying to get to another

281
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,640
country

282
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,240
the south china morning post reported

283
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:17,440
his situation

284
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:19,279
as a journalist and a reporter stated

285
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,200
an experience of the worst in humanity

286
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,000
was not what ibrahim muhammad hussein

287
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,279
expected

288
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,839
when he touched down in hong kong eight

289
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,040
months ago fresh from persecution in

290
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,440
africa

291
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,160
now i mentioned constructive refillment

292
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,160
and this is a

293
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,600
framework and a strategy that's

294
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,640
implemented by the hunger government

295
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,279
and professors at chinese university

296
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,880
um have described it as follows given

297
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,399
that a necessary consequence of the

298
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,000
government's policies is social

299
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,600
exclusion and destitution

300
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,360
there are major concerns particularly

301
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,040
for the mental health of refugees

302
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,959
this is especially the case because

303
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,319
refugees stranded in the territory faced

304
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,800
indefinite periods

305
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,240
while claims are processed all the while

306
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,479
plagued by uncertainty

307
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,320
such such concerns not only raise the

308
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,959
issues of compelling compatibility with

309
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,240
the i

310
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,518
c e scr and iccpr but also place the

311
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,200
individual concerned at risk of

312
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,560
returning to the source of danger

313
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,320
thus offending the doctrine of

314
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,479
constructive refund

315
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,680
so hong kong's prohibited from returning

316
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,240
anybody who's seeking

317
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,599
asylum in hong kong until after the

318
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,920
cases are screened

319
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,200
and rejected okay but the hong kong

320
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,800
government

321
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,880
um in parallel with you know with the

322
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,160
that policy that they have to follow uh

323
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,079
the law they have to follow to screen

324
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,000
refugees or assam seekers

325
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,120
is they make their lives so miserable so

326
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,360
difficult

327
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,560
that these asylum seekers mental health

328
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
deteriorates to the point where they

329
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,959
give up and they

330
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,279
they would rather return home to die

331
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,279
there

332
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,300
ibrahim left hong kong but

333
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,600
under international law

334
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,000
[Music]

335
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,079
and hong kong's policies they sent him

336
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,440
back to somalia he was quickly targeted

337
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,880
again

338
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,480
and over a number of years he

339
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,480
sought internal flight relocation

340
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,240
alternatives within somalia

341
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,240
it didn't work and then he finally left

342
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,880
somalia and found his way to the

343
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,399
european union ending up in greece

344
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,079
the first camp he was put in is the

345
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,680
maria mariah

346
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:24,000
refugee camp which

347
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,839
ibrahim describes as a place of violence

348
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,760
there is violence on a daily basis

349
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,519
there was a lack of resources food

350
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,959
the conditions were inhuman and

351
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,320
degrading

352
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,959
and ibrahimovic himself

353
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,040
and the people in his makeshift

354
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,880
structure where they stayed

355
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,079
were attacked on seven occasions during

356
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,480
that time and

357
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:51,839
um the other thing that abraham has

358
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,279
stated is that the the police just stood

359
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,199
by and watched they allowed that to

360
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,240
happen they acquiesced to the violence

361
00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:02,319
against other refugees

362
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,880
and um the plus side

363
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,600
of abraham making it to the european

364
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,399
union

365
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,839
was there's a screening process that

366
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,360
proceeded quickly

367
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:17,360
compared to hong kong and the second

368
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,720
uh plus is that the screening system in

369
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,560
the european union

370
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,600
countries actually grants refugees

371
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,319
refugees that status if they can make

372
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
their case

373
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,839
that they have a well-founded fear of

374
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,279
persecution in hong kong the acceptance

375
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,839
rate was zero

376
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,120
and hong kong not being a signatory to

377
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,880
the u.n convention relating to the

378
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,320
status of refugees

379
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,800
um you know even if you succeeded

380
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,399
you could not obtain refugee status in

381
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,599
hong kong

382
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,600
and you could not resettle there

383
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:56,000
and this is a picture of ibrahim at the

384
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,040
mariah refugee camp there was a

385
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
arson and a large fire at the camp

386
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,959
which left him five days on the streets

387
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,800
outside the camp

388
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,319
and then he would be sent to the lesbos

389
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,319
refugee camp thereafter

390
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,480
now with his acceptance as a refugee in

391
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,399
june 2020

392
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,480
he was still stuck in the camp and

393
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,120
here's another photo of

394
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,720
ibrahim when he went to the lesbos camp

395
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,839
there were no toilets no showers

396
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,839
lack of resources and um

397
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,680
and in late 2020 uh the greek government

398
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,759
uh moved uh allowed ibrahim to leave

399
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,199
the camps and he's now living in a greek

400
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,759
community

401
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,199
supported only for a limited period at a

402
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,360
period of time

403
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:50,399
by the government in january 2021

404
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,920
uh this mistake on my slide 2020 should

405
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,279
be 2021.

406
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,479
um he'll have to fend for himself um

407
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,720
and i i've brought up uh

408
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,240
introduced ibrahim here to everybody

409
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,480
today

410
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,759
because he he's been in both hong kong

411
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,880
and he's found his way to the european

412
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,440
union there are

413
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,720
serious problems on both sides of the of

414
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:16,160
the globe

415
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:19,360
um but he is uh grateful that uh

416
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,880
if the proper screening is apparently

417
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,199
happening in the european union and he's

418
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,560
now

419
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,880
safe in my view

420
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,399
he's an extraordinary person

421
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,839
extraordinary journalist and there are

422
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,360
very few journalists like this on the

423
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,800
planet

424
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,360
with his commit commitment and

425
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,040
willingness to have taken the risks

426
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,000
risking his life to report do reporting

427
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,000
in somalia

428
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,319
abraham would like to continue working

429
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,279
as a journalist again

430
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,240
he's just landing on his feet in greece

431
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,320
right now

432
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,240
and waiting for his formal documents all

433
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,839
those formal documents to be issued

434
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,480
but he's looking to continue to work as

435
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,480
a journalist

436
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,160
now i'm going to go i'm going back to

437
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,280
hong kong and um

438
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,520
and i'm going to be returning to the

439
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,520
known refugees but i'd like to provide a

440
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,000
quick update on what's happening in hong

441
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,119
kong

442
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,400
and the slide i have up here now

443
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,159
basically shows from 2014 to 2019

444
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,959
the rapid decline in human rights in

445
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,640
hong kong and

446
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,520
in particular rendition enforced

447
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,080
disappearances ill-treatment torture and

448
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,160
even

449
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,678
attempted extrajudicial killings and

450
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:39,440
from 2004 to 2019

451
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:42,320
um you know hong kong has become

452
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,320
authoritarian

453
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,039
and and to review what happened last

454
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,720
year uh

455
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,640
carrie lam the chief executive of hong

456
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,360
kong had wanted to bring in

457
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,799
uh enact into a law and extradition bill

458
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,000
which would allow

459
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,440
um rendition of individuals from hong

460
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
kong into mainland china

461
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,799
there would have been a formal legal

462
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,320
mechanism to do that

463
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,840
hong kong people and lawyers in hong

464
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,960
kong are very well aware that

465
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,799
that mainland china judiciary

466
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,919
is not independent it's like any other

467
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,160
government department under the

468
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,280
executive

469
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,960
it's policy and politically motivated

470
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:24,160
in terms of how judges in mainland china

471
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,840
try criminal cases due process rights

472
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,120
uh are limited in in the chinese

473
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,000
criminal justice system

474
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,479
and at times do not exist um and i'm

475
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,960
going to

476
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,039
mention the case of michael spavor and

477
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,000
michael kovrig two canadians who were

478
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,600
detained into december 2018.

479
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,919
innocent canadians have done nothing

480
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,399
wrong arbitrarily arrested detained

481
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,320
and this year earlier this year charged

482
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,440
with crimes in mainland china

483
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,960
and the mainland chinese government has

484
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,960
effectively admitted that they've

485
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,440
they're holding the two canadians

486
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,480
hostage uh as a bargaining chip

487
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,440
uh to pressure the canadian government

488
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,760
to

489
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,120
to bring an end to the extradition uh

490
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,480
proceedings against uh

491
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:14,719
hmong won joe um of the huawei

492
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:17,520
uh chinese telecom group um

493
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,799
of significance so i'm mentioning this

494
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,679
because the

495
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,960
the two michaels cases in in china

496
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,919
highlight

497
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,280
um you know the deficiencies the clear

498
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,880
deficiencies and shortcomings of the

499
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,240
criminal justice system in china

500
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,720
and hong kong people you know were not

501
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,720
prepared to accept that they would face

502
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,120
justice or accused of a crime and have

503
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,480
to

504
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,399
go through a criminal justice system in

505
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,160
china mainland china

506
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,840
so protests broke out people in the

507
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,960
millions

508
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,918
went into the streets from june 19 2019

509
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,799
onward

510
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,480
and it was in september 2019 that carrie

511
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,480
lam the chief executive of hong kong

512
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,240
announced that the extradition bill

513
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,720
would be withdrawn so that was a great

514
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,720
success

515
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,159
now with covet 19

516
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,600
human rights violations in hong kong

517
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,799
have just continued on and they've

518
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,000
become worse

519
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,960
and the hong kong government recognizing

520
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,559
that

521
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,440
millions of people would not be going

522
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,840
out in the streets to protest

523
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,200
under covet 19 because nobody you know

524
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,720
everybody understood they

525
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,600
there's a public serious public health

526
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,760
risk and people don't want to get sick

527
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,840
so there are limited protests but hong

528
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,679
kong and beijing calculated that

529
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,439
you wouldn't have the millions of people

530
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,360
on the streets and they

531
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,960
introduced a bill that beijing actually

532
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,959
did this through their own legislature

533
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,479
enacting a constitutional provision

534
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,240
under the new under article 23 of the

535
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,880
hong kong basic law which is hong kong's

536
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,600
constitution

537
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,240
basically bringing in new crimes against

538
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,320
the state

539
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,039
and i've put in the slide those crimes

540
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,639
secession subversion terrorism collusion

541
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,000
with foreign forces legislation is a

542
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,280
constitutional provision

543
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,679
it's ambiguous it's poorly written and

544
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:13,280
it can be interpreted in a way

545
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,280
because of its ambiguity

546
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:21,600
interpreted and used in an arbitrary way

547
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,080
and used to violate the the rights of

548
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:27,120
any any civilian in hong kong

549
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:32,080
i'm going to go into the

550
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,080
scope of of this law um

551
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,760
if one is arrested if a person's

552
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,158
arrested under the new national security

553
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,158
law

554
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,240
there's no presumption of bail anymore

555
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,640
the defendant actually has the burden of

556
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,159
proof on them

557
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:49,360
to seek uh bail uh

558
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:53,200
indefinite detention um if bail's

559
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,959
uh not granted that person couldn't be

560
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,280
sitting in remand in a jail for

561
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,520
months or years before trial the trials

562
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,280
are going to be held behind closed doors

563
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,039
the judges are actually selected by the

564
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,200
executive branch of government

565
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,120
they select judges from the judiciary

566
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,200
but it's not the chief justice of the

567
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,000
of the hong kong court quarterfinal

568
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,919
appeal um

569
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,820
that choose selects the judges to be on

570
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,159
that list that the government chooses

571
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:21,360
[Music]

572
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,039
in this law anyone who's accused of a

573
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,959
national security fence under hong

574
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,760
kong's basic law

575
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,840
can be renditioned to mainland china to

576
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,919
face justice there

577
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,399
so what the hong kong authorities were

578
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,360
not able to achieve in 2019 they've now

579
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,159
beijing has now achieved so that anybody

580
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,158
in hong kong

581
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,919
who is accused of committing a national

582
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,799
security crime

583
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,360
um can be brought into mainland china

584
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,559
and face justice there

585
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,280
extra territorial criminality anybody

586
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,840
who

587
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,520
writes something says something does

588
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,959
something that is critical of

589
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,440
the hong kong government um

590
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,159
if the hong kong authorities feel that

591
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,440
this is

592
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:11,200
uh an act of secession or subversion

593
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,360
they can seek the extradition of that

594
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,280
person let's say in canada or in germany

595
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,678
or another country

596
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,559
so this new national security law has a

597
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,559
global

598
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:25,600
reach okay consequence of this is

599
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,918
countries in europe including germany um

600
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,439
the united states canada new zealand the

601
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,280
uk australia

602
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,720
have all either suspended or terminated

603
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,320
the extradition agreements

604
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,880
treaties that they have with hong kong

605
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,439
the reason being is

606
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,080
the new national security law is a de

607
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,600
facto

608
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,480
back door uh to for beijing to extradite

609
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,320
people from

610
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,080
around the world very few countries have

611
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,279
extradition treaties with mainland china

612
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,279
because of

613
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,600
the shortcomings in its criminal justice

614
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,600
system

615
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,799
and there i've put up a slide just

616
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,919
listening a few countries that have

617
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,080
suspended treaties

618
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,080
and

619
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,159
now within the hong kong legal

620
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,600
government itself three branches of

621
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,520
government the executive branch

622
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,039
legislative and judiciary

623
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,360
it's quite clear that beijing now has

624
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,640
firm control over the executive branch

625
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,000
of government

626
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:25,520
carrilem you know

627
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,159
loyal to beijing you know following

628
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,520
through on

629
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,960
directions from beijing also in 2020 we

630
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,240
saw

631
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,960
officers from mainland china

632
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,640
now working in hong kong side by side

633
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,279
with hong kong civil servants

634
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,520
and and basically advising and directing

635
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,440
the legislature

636
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,080
a number of pro-democracy legislators

637
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,600
were removed actually by beijing

638
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:54,639
and new legislation was imposed by

639
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,000
beijing that anyone who

640
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:01,120
is viewed as a risk to national security

641
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,120
okay without trial can be removed from

642
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,559
the legislature

643
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,959
there were supposed to be elections for

644
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,639
the legislature in

645
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,039
earlier this year they were counseled

646
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,279
because of kovid

647
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,480
and with the new new law imposed by

648
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,600
beijing there was a

649
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,960
mass resignation by the pro-democracy

650
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,918
legislators in hong kong

651
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,000
so effectively beijing has taken control

652
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,159
of hong kong's legislature

653
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,080
the last or third branch of government

654
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,520
the judiciary

655
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,639
there's been a number of cases

656
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,879
where judges have brought in their

657
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,559
political opinions um

658
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,240
most significantly a non-permanent judge

659
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,799
of the quarterfinal appeal australian

660
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,520
justice spiegelman resigned in september

661
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:47,039
this year from the quarterfinal appeal

662
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,039
citing the new national security law

663
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,000
freedom of expression in hong kong is

664
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:56,719
frozen free room association assembly

665
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,960
and mobility of severely diminished um

666
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,960
hong kong was ranked 18th in the world

667
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,080
uh in terms of freedom of the press

668
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,600
uh journalism but in 2020 it's it fell

669
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,600
down to 80th place

670
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,279
um in the news right now has been the

671
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,760
arrest of jimmy ly the founder of apple

672
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:14,080
daily under the national security law

673
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,120
bale was denied but he secured bail last

674
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,039
week

675
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,320
from the high court the department of

676
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,360
justice uh

677
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,639
director of public prosecutions has

678
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,799
filed an appeal to that to the

679
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,279
quarterfinal appeal

680
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,279
to seek

681
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,760
that the bail be revoked for mr ly

682
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,200
there's also other examples of

683
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,158
journalists like troy eugling

684
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,679
of rthk what the hong kong authorities

685
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,799
have been doing the last year

686
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,279
is if they if they cannot find a basis

687
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,279
to

688
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,120
arrest an individual journalist or

689
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,400
activist or politician under the new

690
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,879
national security law

691
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:53,919
they use some draconian laws

692
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,840
or try to find some technicality to you

693
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,679
know arrest somebody

694
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,080
uh for something that's not even related

695
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:03,279
to their work um

696
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,399
simply trying to shut shut up or

697
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,919
stop uh the media from speaking and

698
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,679
writing their stories

699
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:14,559
um in 2000 2017 there's been an exodus

700
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,720
on mass from hong kong it's been quiet

701
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:20,000
it's been steady

702
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:23,679
but that exodus accelerated

703
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,840
in 2019 and um

704
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,440
and accelerated even more in 2020 with

705
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,000
the new national security law

706
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,120
and and talking to clients and

707
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,559
colleagues the

708
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,000
the shipping and freight companies in

709
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:38,720
hong kong are overbooked

710
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,399
there that data indicates that there's

711
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,159
large number numbers of people leaving

712
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:45,760
hong kong

713
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,760
they do not see a future in hong kong

714
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,279
now canada started accepting refugees uh

715
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,279
earlier this year and in september

716
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:57,279
canada started granting refugee status

717
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,880
of hong kong people who have been

718
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,799
politically persecuted because of their

719
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:05,120
participation in protests or

720
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,120
they voice their opinion um

721
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,279
the chinese ambassador to canada and

722
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,678
ottawa

723
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,200
uh spoke out and i'll quote what he said

724
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,279
we strongly urge the canadian side not

725
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,440
to grant so-called political asylum to

726
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,279
those violent criminals as refugees

727
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,039
because it is interference in china's

728
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,880
domestic affairs and certainly it will

729
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:26,080
embolden those violent criminals

730
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,660
now it was on 15th of october 2020.

731
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,600
and and what is

732
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,480
[Music]

733
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,279
interesting here is that china is

734
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,360
actually

735
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,880
a signatory to the u.n convention

736
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,879
relating to the status of refugees

737
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,678
and the refugee convention

738
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,879
forms part of china's constitution and

739
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,880
part of that

740
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,919
is to respect and recognize that other

741
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,960
countries will

742
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,960
screen uh asylum seekers

743
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,640
and grant them refugee status if they

744
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,640
show well founded fear of persecution

745
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,679
whether it's religion ethnicity

746
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:05,120
race nationality political opinion

747
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:07,200
or or other social group and

748
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,239
what's also interesting is that in under

749
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,039
the

750
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,760
refugee convention under article 1f and

751
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:17,120
33.2 but 1f in particular

752
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:20,879
that if anybody had committed a serious

753
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:24,080
violent offense let's say in hong kong

754
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,240
even if they're granted recognized as a

755
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,080
refugee they would not be granted

756
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,840
refugee status because of

757
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,320
that violence so the chinese ambassador

758
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,840
to

759
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,639
hong kong apparently doesn't understand

760
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,760
the law and doesn't understand or

761
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,360
respect that canada will be looking at

762
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,440
whether any asylum seekers have

763
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,320
committed offenses that would

764
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,600
exclusively

765
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,600
exclude them from that protection

766
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,880
over the last year we've seen

767
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,240
legislators

768
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,240
former legislators members of political

769
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,360
opposing political parties flee the

770
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,360
jurisdiction okay

771
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,120
what hong kong authorities in beijing

772
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,158
have been trying to do

773
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:15,039
is to find a bases

774
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,120
or whether they're founded well found

775
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,679
founded or not

776
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,959
on evidence but to arrest them put them

777
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,240
into the hong kong criminal justice

778
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,559
system and

779
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,240
in applying for bail typically a

780
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,279
condition is they hand over their travel

781
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,799
documents

782
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,360
so there are a lot of activists and

783
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,679
politicians in hong kong who can't leave

784
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,520
because they don't have travel documents

785
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,960
beijing and hong kong clearly want to

786
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,240
close the borders on

787
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,080
anyone who's not you know expresses

788
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,120
dissent against the hong kong or beijing

789
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,960
governments

790
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,879
but there are there have been

791
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,520
legislators and political activists who

792
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,760
have fled

793
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,720
and i've put on a slide ray wong and

794
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,279
alan lee had fled in 2017 about that

795
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,600
time and

796
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,559
were granted refugee status in germany

797
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,918
baguio lung

798
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:03,600
recently fled to the u.s simon chang

799

hong lao sunny cho ted hoy nathan law

800
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,199
wayne chan and sam your chu have all

801
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,919
left hong kong and they're all seeking

802
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,360
asylum

803
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,000
um political asylum in western europe or

804
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,000
north america

805
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:20,240
now coming back to the snowden refugees

806
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,279

uh

819
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,678
you know it really projects the

820
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,240
the feeling uh you know after almost a

821
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,440
year

822
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,279
of having to practice uh social

823
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,720
distancing and never other

824
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,000
safe practices so they don't get

without any food or or rent and uh

836

so i contacted uh

841

people i know in the montreal community

842
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,559
and they stepped forward and they set up

843
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:52,080
a non-profit organization

844
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:54,320

situation where he was looking at losing

the somali journalist from 2003 onward

910
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
ajith has been subjected to systemic

911
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,720
racism and discrimination by the hong

912
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,839

assistance

915
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,720
and i took on his uh case in 2012

916
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,078
and uh he's constantly been subjected to

917
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,000
racial profiling

918
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,839
even not showing up to conferences uh

law conferences that i was holding

920
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,400
because the police had stopped him on

921
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,800
the street as he was trying to get to my

922
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,800
office

923
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,839

know by the police immigration against

925
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:58,400
him and also there's been attacks by the

926
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:02,160
government against myself with the view

927
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,160
of removing me as his lawyer

928
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,400
this is a photo of ajith a couple years

929
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,520
ago

930
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,240
and he's he's had a very difficult time

931
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,240
in hong kong

932
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,839
for 17 years you know he

933
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,000
he was subjected he's been subjected to

934
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:28,160
discrimination as i've

935
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,200
described and all of this has had an

936
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,200
enormously adverse impact on a chief and

937
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,839
that he's

938
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,680
his his mental condition has has

939
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,040
collapsed a number of times and he's

940
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,000
he's just wanted to give up

941
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,880
and he's been what i would describe as a

942
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,200
victim of

943
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,640
constructive refoulement but fortunately

944
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,359
we were able to convince him

945
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,240
and we did have recently tried to get

946
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,839
him some help

947
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,759
he's been suffering from post-traumatic

948
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,320
stress disorder

949
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,800
since before he left sri lanka untreated

950
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,240
and only

951
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,720
recently we've been able to get him a

952
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,000
little bit of help

953
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:07,919
um going to his role with mr snowden in

954
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,440
2013 when mr snowden arrived

955
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,960
despite all the terrible things that

956
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,280
have happened to him the persecution

957
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,640
he's

958
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,880
in discrimination he suffered in sri

959
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,319
lanka and hong kong aji stepped forward

960
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,680
and

961
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,920
you know was more than willing to help

962
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:24,480
mr snowden shelter

963
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:27,760
in 2013 and

964
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,800
in 2016 because

965
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:34,000
of ajith story coming

966
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,520
into the public domain the hong kong

967
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,640
government targeted him

968
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:42,480
because of his assistance to mr snowden

969
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,240
and targeted myself and in 2018

970
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,599
ajith was left without the support of

971
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,759
the duty lord service

972
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,280
but myself and another lawyer found a

973
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,920
solicitor willing to instruct us

974
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:55,760
privately to continue his appeal

975
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,760
now in parallel to all of this i advised

976
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,800
the chief to apply to canada for refugee

977
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,480
status

978
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:05,359
a private sponsor was found in quebec

979
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,839
and ajith's refugee claims were filed in

980
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:11,759
january 2017

981
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:13,920
and while all of this was happening the

982
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,520
sri lankan police aware that ajith was

983
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,040
in hong kong

984
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,800
sent police officers to hong kong in

985
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,800
december 2016 looking for him

986
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,240
the hong kong police instead of

987
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,240
investigating the sri lankan police

988
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:32,640
made a decision to investigate myself

989
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:35,680
and my clients

990
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,920
now ajith's case was rejected by

991
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,720
immigration in may 2017 and i filed his

992
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,839
appeal in the

993
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:45,279
torture clinton appeal board and this is

994
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:45,920
a major update um on the g the situation

995
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,960
in hong

996
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,520
kong in that his appeal was heard

997
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,119
by an australian adjudicator and

998
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,759
barrister adam moore

999
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,680
into who took up who was the adjudicator

1000
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,720
in his case in 2017

1001
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:04,160
heard his full appeal in june 2018

1002
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,598
and not no decision has been handed down

1003
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,879
in three and a half years

1004
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,800
from 2018 to november this year adam

1005
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,119
moore had not handed down a decision

1006
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,119
and there is no explanation for that and

1007
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,800
then suddenly in november 2020 the

1008
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,079
torture claim appeal board

1009
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,520
announced that uh mr moore was no longer

1010
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:25,119
the adjudicator

1011
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:28,160
without giving any reason and now a

1012
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,599
panel of three adjudicators would hear

1013
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,920
ajith's case

1014
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,920
and start that process all over again

1015
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:41,839
this is this is a process that's been

1016
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,960
delayed and in my view abused by the

1017
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:45,759
security bureau

1018
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,920
and the torture claim appeal board uh it

1019
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,839
is there's no rational basis

1020
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,920
why um the torture claim appeal board

1021
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,000
did not hand down a decision on energy's

1022
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,520
case years ago

1023
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,960
and this is an example of how

1024
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,480
this part of the judiciary

1025
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,920
there's a lack of transparency and

1026
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,960
accountability and

1027
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,240
the second significant event

1028
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,520
is that one of the three adjudicators is

1029
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,399
an australian

1030
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,839
adjudicator named uh fraser syme and

1031
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,839
he's one of the three

1032
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,400
on the new panel of three for ajith's

1033
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:26,960
appeal mr

1034
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,599
syme was also the same adjudicator in

1035
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,599
the

1036
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,440
appeal of the other snowden refugee

1037
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,839
family of sapporo nadika and the two

1038
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,839
children

1039
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,759
and mr simer rejected their appeals

1040
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,118
and now the torture claim appeal board

1041
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:46,319
has found it proper to appoint mr syme

1042
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:49,839
who's already predetermined

1043
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:52,079
decided refugee grounds

1044
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:54,078
for sapone and his family that are the

1045
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,040
same grounds for ajith's case so there's

1046
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:00,079
an adjudicator on the new tcab panel

1047
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,680
that has already predetermined the

1048
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,680
appeal against a chief at least on

1049
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,319
certain refugee grounds

1050
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,240
so there's an appearance of bias there's

1051
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:11,359
clearly a conflict of interest

1052
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,359
making matters worse is

1053
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:15,359
a judicial review leave application was

1054
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:19,119
filed in the high court in

1055
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:21,680
january 2019 challenging fraser symes

1056
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,280
rejection of support in his family's

1057
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,279
refugee claims

1058
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,119
so the torture claim appeal board has

1059
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,280
put in mr symes

1060
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:34,960
knowing full well that his decision in

1061
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:37,200
on the exact refugee grounds

1062
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,400
for support and also achieve those

1063
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,319
common grounds

1064
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:45,839
may be overturned by the high court

1065
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:49,359
so it's quite clear with

1066
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:51,920
years of delay inordinate delay and the

1067
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,359
removal or disappearance of adam morris

1068
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,359
the adjudicator

1069
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:58,400
and com you know the constitution of a

1070
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,279
new

1071
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,240
tribunal after so many years with fraser

1072
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,720
syme on there

1073
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:07,839
that he's not receiving a fair process

1074
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,839
here fair hearing

1075
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,280
now in terms of ajith's mental health

1076
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,160
the situation

1077
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,240
the 2019 pro-democracy protests and the

1078
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,480
police crackdowns

1079
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,399
ajith saw firsthand how the police were

1080
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:28,000
acting arbitrarily and attacking

1081
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,319
innocent bystanders protesters

1082
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,880
and this re-traumatized ajith these are

1083
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:35,520
the same scenes and the same conduct of

1084
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:39,440
police in hong kong that he witnessed in

1085
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,440
sri lanka when he was in sri lanka

1086
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,640
the new national security law similar to

1087
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,680
the prevention of

1088
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,520
terrorism act in sri lanka is another

1089
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,118
factor which is to re-traumatize the

1090
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,119
chief and he's in fear for his life

1091
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,440
making matters worse there's an

1092
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,720
immigration amendment bill

1093
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,880
that's just been brought into the

1094
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,439
legislature and mind you the legislature

1095
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,560
has no opposition it's

1096
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,160
basically probating controlled and in

1097
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,759
this new legislation

1098
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,720
immigration officers will now be able to

1099
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,880
carry guns and steal batons

1100
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,200
when dealing with refugees this is

1101
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,319
simply going to re-traumatize

1102
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:23,359
my client and other refugees

1103
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:25,759
there's now powers to detain

1104
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:28,319
asylum seekers effectively indefinitely

1105
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,800
when they're in hong kong

1106
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,400
there's new provisions where the

1107
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,319
immigration officer will decide

1108
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,240
effectively if interpreters are needed

1109
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,880
and it'll be the immigration officers of

1110
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,640
you whether

1111
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,599
a person a person screening interviews

1112
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,040
or appeal

1113
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,599
should be conducted without an

1114
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,599
interpreter

1115
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,560
the other issue that is shocking in my

1116
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,240
view is after the first stage of

1117
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,599
immigration screening if the cases are

1118
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,040
rejected

1119
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,800
there are now powers for immigration

1120
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:02,160
officers to go to foreign consulates

1121
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:05,119
to obtain to start the process obtaining

1122
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,078
travel documents that should never

1123
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,359
happen until

1124
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:11,839
after all appeals

1125
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:13,359
are exhausted so what's happening is

1126
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,799
that all these asylum seekers

1127
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,560
contrary to you and guidelines their

1128
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,000
identities are being exposed at the

1129
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,400
first stage

1130
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,960
to foreign governments that they've fled

1131
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:27,680
from fled persecution from

1132
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:29,839
um usually a hearing could not be held

1133
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,960
you know before 28 days in the torch

1134
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:35,440
claim appeal board

1135
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:38,560
now the limit is seven days which again

1136
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,760
now how do i view all of all of these

1137
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,350
changes to the immigration

1138
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,000
legislation it's just um

1139
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:47,598
[Music]

1140
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,280
a legislative and policy framework that

1141
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,839
is going to put more pressure in asylum

1142
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,040
seekers and it violates in my view the

1143
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:57,200
doctrine of

1144
00:44:53,040 --> 00:45:00,319
constructive fulfillment where

1145
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,078
we've set up uh mintumtron and montreal

1146
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,240
set up the

1147
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,520
nonprofit helpageeth.com and we're

1148
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,720
asking for donations

1149
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,079
ajith needs support during this time he

1150
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,160
is waiting as with the other stone

1151
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,280
refugees the outcomes of their asylum

1152
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,279
cases in canada

1153
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,480
but pending that time ajith needs help

1154
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,800
and we'd ask that

1155
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,319
uh if you can go to the website and

1156
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,920
donate

1157
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,560
no matter how big or small the donations

1158
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,880
are ajit needs help

1159
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,880
thank you

1160
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:32,160
hi everyone my name is ibrahim mohammed

1161
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:35,440
hussein

1162
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:38,399
i'm a journalist from somalia

1163
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,839
both the somali government and al-shabab

1164
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,960
targeted me

1165
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:45,839
i had been kidnapped and tortured

1166
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,760
the reason i was not killed is because

1167
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:53,599
my family and friends

1168
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,599
paid ransom money to spare my life

1169
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,319
i fled to hong kong only to be treated

1170
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,599
like a criminal

1171
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,839
and subjected to resist them as i lived

1172
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,640
in

1173
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:07,359
poverty degraded and treated and

1174
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,359
hymnally

1175
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:12,319
my life in hong kong was like a slow

1176
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,280
death

1177
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:16,000
i was hunted back to somalia and once

1178
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,880
again

1179
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,240
had to run for my life and could not

1180
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,240
even see my family

1181
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:29,760
i then found my way to europe leading

1182
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:33,029
in greece i found myself

1183
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,640
in two refugee camps fighting again

1184
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:37,599
[Music]

1185
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,879
to survive the kami's were in high human

1186
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:42,240
and degrading

1187
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:46,319
many refugees were violently

1188
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:49,279
injured and killed inside the calm

1189
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:51,599
what suffered me was the refugee

1190
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:56,480
screening which preceded

1191
00:46:51,599 --> 00:47:00,560
rapidly a human rights in hong kong

1192
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:03,280
do not exit for refugees but i was lucky

1193
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,200
to have a human rights lawyer master

1194
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,839
robert tibo

1195
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,879
without his help i would not be here

1196
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:14,160
today thank you very much

1197
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,480
guys i know about the agitator claim

1198
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,118
i've been in hong kong has been

1199
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,599
for three and a half years and i know

1200
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,839
that the

1201
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:25,040
adjudicator for his appeal has

1202
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:27,839
disappeared and there is no decision in

1203
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,680
his appeal after three and a half years

1204
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:31,680
i know that the billboard is now

1205
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,720
starting his appeal

1206
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:37,040
start all over again now

1207
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:40,720
with the three jobs here in his appeal i

1208
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:43,680
think this is so unfair to ajit

1209
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,720
he has waiting for 17 years for his case

1210
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,440
to be decided

1211
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,720
after almost 4 years the appeal board

1212
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,040
forces

1213
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,000
him to start all over again it is the

1214
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,200
hong kong government

1215
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,440
causing all this delay

1216
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,118
from from my own experience in in the

1217
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,440
hong kong april boyd

1218
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:04,000
the judge was unpaired and i clearly

1219
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:07,920
traumatized

1220
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,960
for ajit to again have to go

1221
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,520
through another appeal will be a real

1222
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:17,760
trauma for him

1223
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:21,440
he will be forced to tell his torture

1224
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:26,079
experience again

1225
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,079
and it will give him nightmare

1226
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:34,559

1227

1264
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,760
but uh mr tibble are there any other

1265
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,280

and watchers who have just seen what

1267
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,280
you've presented them to the very

1268
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,359
personal messages by

1269
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,520
may you voices heard in order to to

foster the cases of those people you

1271
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:22,079
european yes as i mentioned

1272
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:22,640
uh a primary way to support my clients

1273
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,520
uh

1274
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,118
in particular at geeth at this time is

1275
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,720
to is to make donations

1276
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:34,240
uh there's a website uh at g help

1277
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:36,879
help at geth.com uh where you can make

1278
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,520
make donations uh various ways from uh

1279
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:43,119
credit card to uh bitcoin

1280
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,920
um the the other issue is is awareness

1281
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,400
and discussion

1282
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,359
um a lot there's a lot of talk about you

1283
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,200
know

1284
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:51,200
the role of whistleblowers uh

1285
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,240
particularly um

1286
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,598
in today's world and

1287
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,200
but there's been less talk about the

1288
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,440
protection of whistleblowers and the

1289
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,558
snowden refugees did the extraordinary

1290
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,319
by stepping forward making their

1291
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:07,680
decisions of conscience

1292
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:10,079
to provide shelter and food and

1293
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:12,240
compassion to mr snowden when he was in

1294
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:16,160
hong kong in 2013.

1295
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:17,040
and um in in all this known refugees

1296
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,558
cases

1297
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,480
one of the grounds for refugee

1298
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,880
protection is uh

1299
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,960
the clients have a well-founded fear of

1300
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,960
persecution

1301
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,640
based on political opinion and that they

1302
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,240
made decisions to

1303
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:34,078
help mr snowden and so that forms a

1304
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,040
social group

1305
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,599
those who help or protect whistleblowers

1306
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,359
and um

1307
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,200
i think that you know there needs to be

1308
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:43,680
more discussion about

1309
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,040
um you know the importance of people in

1310
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,598
society who

1311
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,960
and uh the you know the courage that it

1312
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,400
takes to step forward and to help

1313
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,359
somebody

1314
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,680
particularly for high profile cases it's

1315
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,680
uh

1316
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,598
it's easy to help somebody or a group of

1317
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:00,879
people

1318
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:04,240
when it's a a popular

1319
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,040
person or a popular cause or if it's a

1320
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,799
low problem

1321
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,160
profile cost but it's extremely

1322
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,640
difficult for an individual to step

1323
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:13,759
forward to help another

1324
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:16,799
when even though the cause is

1325
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:19,920
the most just cause

1326
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,960
but it's unpopular so there are legal

1327
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,559
and moral uh and ethical issues

1328
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,720
um and i think that should be part of

1329
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:30,559
the discussion that everyone

1330
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:31,839
should be having thank you for that

1331
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:35,440
there's been a question on the chat

1332
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:35,440
which i need to rephrase because

1333
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,880
um the question is how to build a global

1334
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:44,160
consciousness against

1335
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:47,839
and uh to to join up forces uh both from

1336
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,839
a loyally and then scholarly

1337
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:52,800
groups that that believe more in direct

1338
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,240
action

1339
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,800
uh you'll you'll have to repeat that

1340
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:59,118
again the signal came through a bit

1341
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,960
choppy

1342
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,640
question on the chat um whether there's

1343
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,920
any any efforts to

1344
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,118
build a global current state of state

1345
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,119
oppression more or less

1346
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,720
and coordinate between teams that take a

1347
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:14,720
more

1348
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:17,919
instead leave more in direct action

1349
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,959
um i think what's happening is you're

1350
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,640
seeing

1351
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:24,340
this kind of action with non-profits

1352
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,759
lawyers

1353
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:28,480
[Music]

1354
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,839
through protests and you're seeing it

1355
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,040
within

1356
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:34,960
communities within cities within whole

1357
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,640
jurisdictions

1358
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,640
but i i think what's happened with the

1359
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,598
covid situation

1360
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,200
is you know that that's basically

1361
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,040
compelled everybody because of the

1362
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,520
public health issues

1363
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,040
you know iso self-isolating social

1364
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,640
distancing masks

1365
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,558
we've we've had to take a step back to

1366
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,240
think okay how do we communicate now how

1367
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,000
do we interact and exercise our

1368
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,959
fundamental rights and freedoms so i

1369
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,280
think we're in a

1370
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:04,400
in a dangerous period where um you know

1371
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:07,760
we're we're still struggling how to

1372
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,280
connect globally uh to cooperate and

1373
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,480
bring this kind of awareness

1374
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:14,079
about the second issue is to do that

1375
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,079
you need to be able to get the message

1376
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:19,359
out through advocacy

1377
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,160
and activism right now the covet

1378
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:22,960
pandemic

1379
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,359
consumes the media reports i've been

1380
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,319
told

1381
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:27,520
about 75 or 85 percent of you know news

1382
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:31,200
coverage in a given

1383
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:34,480
media organization 75 to 85

1384
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:36,160
um at the same time governments are

1385
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,880
using the cover of covid

1386
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,480
uh the global pandemic to suppress

1387
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,920
freedom of expression

1388
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:45,040
and uh two strip away fundamental rights

1389
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,640
and freedoms

1390
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,319
so i think the question's a great

1391
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,640
question and i think

1392
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,319
it's a matter of you know when doing

1393
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,759
this through encrypted means doing it

1394
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:55,920
where you have your privacy

1395
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,599
for global groups to consider how do we

1396
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,640
connect up together what messages we

1397
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,079
want to get out

1398
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,680
but then the real challenge would be

1399
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,720
getting the message out through

1400
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,118
um to the public because of the current

1401
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,558
uh

1402
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:12,640
global pandemic are they

1403
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:13,520
already to go ahead and prepare all the

1404
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,440
messaging to

1405
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,799
to come out of the pandemic if and when

1406
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:20,480
it

1407
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:24,160
together i but

1408
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:26,319
as far like i'm not aware of any

1409
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,200
concerted efforts uh globally i mean

1410
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,759
there are some

1411
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,480
non-profits around the world who are

1412
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,480
trying to get

1413
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,240
you know messages out they're trying to

1414
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,520
get stakeholders of those affected in

1415
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,250
different jurisdictions

1416
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,559
but but right now um

1417
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:42,160
[Music]

1418
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:45,359
uh i'm not aware of of you know

1419
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:48,640
any organized considerate effort to

1420
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:49,730
to try to have this sort of

1421
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,680
global connection and

1422
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:54,000
[Music]

1423
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,799
being able to speak globally but also

1424
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,960
locally

1425
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:58,480
you know informing the the global

1426
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,640
community what's going on

1427
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:05,119
um i think where it's just a

1428
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,480
difficult time uh one of the best

1429
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,760
examples is hong kong

1430
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,599
with covid the covet uh uh pandemic

1431
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,160
there there's been four waves

1432
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:15,760
and in the midst of the second wave of

1433
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,440
the pandemic in hong kong

1434
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,880
beijing imposed the new national

1435
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,839
security law

1436
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,359
which basically has stripped away um you

1437
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:24,720
know fundamental rights of freedom of

1438
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:27,279
expression

1439
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,720
um so i think we're just in a difficult

1440
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,400
time and it's going to be for different

1441
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,959
groups around the world to figure out

1442
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:36,319
how to communicate

1443
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,240
you know hopefully the pandemic will

1444
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:40,480
come to an end in the end of this year

1445
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:43,759
or next year

1446
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,040
you know see where we go from there

1447
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,559
there's one more question from the chat

1448
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,480
and i think it's a softball pitch more

1449
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,559
or less

1450
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,280
free eternal espresso free autonomous

1451
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:55,839
media as in decentralized uh

1452
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,839
probably on

1453
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:03,118
one of uh getting the message out

1454
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,640
all right uh the signal's a bit choppy

1455
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:07,440
i've missed the middle of your question

1456
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:09,920
if you could repeat it

1457
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:13,440
okay that would you say that a free and

1458
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:15,599
autonomous press autonomous media

1459
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,480
almost as decentralized probably

1460
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,240
uncensorable

1461
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,799
would be a cornerstone of getting the

1462
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,799
message out

1463
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,000
absolutely um you know one one thing

1464
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:29,680
that i've talked about in past

1465
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:32,240
talks and um is that

1466
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,440
two two things have happened uh are

1467
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,959
happening at this time and have been

1468
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:38,319
happening over the last decade

1469
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:41,599
and that is um uh

1470
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:44,079
journalism has you know

1471
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:45,599
mainstream journalism is being eroded uh

1472
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:48,960
investigative journalists

1473
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:50,559
uh are fewer number today and journalism

1474
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,480
has become more centralized in major

1475
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:55,599
urban centers

1476
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:58,079
and in smaller cities

1477
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:00,240
towns rural areas uh there is no more

1478
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:03,520
journalism there at all

1479
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:06,319
in a lot of regions around the world and

1480
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:08,559
when those things happen uh you have

1481
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:12,240
poor behavior of local government

1482
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:14,480
um in terms of policies

1483
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,680
uh public expenditure and also abuses of

1484
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:19,520
human rights

1485
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:20,839
um we are really in desperate need of

1486
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,599
having

1487
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:24,799
independent uh autonomous journalists

1488
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:28,000
and journalism

1489
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:32,160
um at this time more than ever

1490
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,960
um and uh but at the same time

1491
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:36,240
you know journalists who have the

1492
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:40,319
capacity and capability

1493
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:43,279
to do investigative journalism um

1494
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:44,640
you know that the the problem with

1495
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,640
what's what's been happening in the last

1496
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:49,118
five years ten years is that

1497
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:51,839
the media that's centered in the major

1498
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:51,839
urban centers

1499
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:56,000
they're not picking up stories and

1500
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,920
speaking for the more vulnerable or

1501
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,799
those who are geographically outside of

1502
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,960
main areas

1503
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:01,839
and that's a very dangerous thing so yes

1504
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,839
i agree

1505
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:07,440
there should be autonomous media and

1506
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:09,759
there should not be censoring on that

1507
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,760
media

1508
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,319
so in fact if you if you look at that um

1509
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,319
i mean

1510
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,480
encrypted communication is well and

1511
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,559
everybody should use it especially to

1512
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,640
to exchange information uh with

1513
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:26,079
journalists but in the end for the

1514
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:27,118
for the general public um independent

1515
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,000
media that is not

1516
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:31,359
centralized in in some some few

1517
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,119
conglomerates

1518
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:36,078
might even be more efficient to get the

1519
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:39,119
message out to the broader masses right

1520
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:41,680
absolutely i think what needs to be done

1521
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:42,720
is you need more autonomous journalism

1522
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,839
and journalists

1523
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:47,200
in smaller cities operating autonomously

1524
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:50,319
in the bigger cities

1525
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,759
um to be able to pick up stories um what

1526
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:54,400
what you're seeing right now

1527
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,599
with with me the mainstream media

1528
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,599
focusing on

1529
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:59,599
covet stories uh for example the us

1530
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:01,359
elections and donald trump

1531
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,799
are that they're not picking up smaller

1532
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:05,598
stories they're not picking up low

1533
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:07,200
profile stories anymore

1534
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,680
and governments are taking advantage of

1535
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,919
that they they know that they can act

1536
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,759
almost with impunity because they know

1537
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:16,079
that smaller stories

1538
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,839
where somebody in your communities you

1539
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,280
know fundamental rights are being

1540
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:20,240
violated by the government or local

1541
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,599
authorities

1542
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:24,959
it's not going to get reported at this

1543
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:27,280
time when the pandemic is over

1544
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,640
the situation will be the same there's a

1545
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,200
lack of independent autonomous

1546
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,200
journalists

1547
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:36,480
one of the big problems is money

1548
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,079
you know a lot of the money that used to

1549
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,200
go into advertising for

1550
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:43,040
mainstream media even local newspapers

1551
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,960
is now going online people are spending

1552
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:47,279
their time looking at

1553
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,880
you know online media that has nothing

1554
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,799
to do with their local communities or

1555
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,960
their even their countries

1556
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:54,319
um people are spending their time on

1557
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,440
youtube and facebook

1558
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:58,480
uh tock is another example where all the

1559
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:01,280
advertising

1560
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,160
is going um so we have a situation where

1561
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,920
enormous

1562
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:08,319
amounts of money are going to

1563
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,359
only certain media some of the

1564
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:11,200
mainstream

1565
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:12,400
a lot of it to you know social

1566
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:16,160
entertainment online

1567
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:18,960
and infotainment um and

1568
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:20,480
the money's disappearing from that

1569
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,960
money's disappearing and it's having an

1570
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,799
impact

1571
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,160
on two things one is the funding of

1572
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:26,799
investigative journalism

1573
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:28,000
number two uh being able to fund and

1574
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:31,759
support

1575
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:35,280
autonomous local media in smaller cities

1576
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:37,760
towns and rural areas and i've seen that

1577
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,599
here in north america and i know the

1578
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,240
same thing's been happening in europe

1579
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,599
and also

1580
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:46,799
in australia new zealand

1581
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,559
already so this means subscribing to

1582
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:51,599
your local small town newspaper

1583
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:53,359
might be even as well as a

1584
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:54,880
as a step in in uh joining the

1585
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:58,078
revolution as

1586
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,720
uh using encrypted messaging absolutely

1587
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:00,400
it's got

1588
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,160
it's got to be a grassroots effort from

1589
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,000
the ground up

1590
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,520

1591
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,960
have a stage so

1592
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,280
