00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,290
[Music]

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:11,689
[Laughter]

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:11,689
[Music]

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,240
hello

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,759
welcome um i hope it's not strange that

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,720
the introduction was actually in german

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
although the talk is

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,439
will be held in english um but i think

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,039
this was uh announced like that on the

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,320
schedule okay so welcome to the bits and

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,000
bob movements for digitalization

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,360
sustainability the current needs of bits

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,680
and trees

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,519
um uh just to make the pun complete

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,519
i changed the translation of bits and

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,559
boimer to kitchen trees

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,399
um so what are we

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,399
talking about today um

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,480
first i want to introduce myself then

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,199
i want to talk about some of the topics

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,760
we

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,960
we're dealing with in bits and boimer

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,360
then i will

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,439
describe the initial conference in 2018

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,119
than the demands that came out of this

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,960
conference

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,320
then i will describe the movement that

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,479
grew out of the

29
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,880
conference and then i will outline

30
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,159
some ways to act which then hopefully

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,158
guides perfectly

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:27,040
into the discussion so

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,240
first to myself i'm reiner rehack i have

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,840
a background in computer science and

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,839
philosophy um

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,680
i work at the bitesmo institute for the

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,680
network society as a researcher

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,880
and i'm active in the forum computer

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,840
professionals for peace and social

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,880
responsibility

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:46,880
um and uh i was uh co-initiating the

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:50,000
bitzerborner conference um just one word

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,158
uh in advance uh regarding the framing

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,040
of and for environmentalism

45
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,040
sustainability

46
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,240
i'm not so much in favor of

47
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,079
the framing that we have to protect

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,240
nature

49
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,279
because the earth does not really care

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,720
about the human beings

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,038
so of course once the humans are gone

52
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,319
um it just needs a certain hundred

53
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,958
thousands of years and then everything

54
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,560
is be

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,319
okay again so i think it's really

56
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,920
important to say uh what we're talking

57
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,480
about and what we're protecting is

58
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,958
also our livelihoods so we all live in

59
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,760
some

60
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,319
symbiosis and you could in a technical

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,560
way say

62
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,480
nature provides services we live and we

63
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,480
need to like to live

64
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,840
so it's you know you can see nature as

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,160
its own value

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,280
of course but we're actually just

67
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,359
fighting for survival

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,800
so this is just to make to make this

69
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,400
somehow clear

70
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,400
so um the topics uh

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,239
so what what are we what what is the the

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,360
whole thing with the digitalization and

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,000
sustainability about well first i would

74
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,560
consider

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,560
a digitalization somehow the

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,319
computerization organization and

77
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,040
datification that takes place all across

78
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,200
the board

79
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,440
a computerization means really hardware

80
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,359
put everywhere iot and such things

81
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,560
algorithmization and data vacation i

82
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,680
think are

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,640
pretty clear terms here

84
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,400
in terms of sustainability i want to

85
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,440
talk about the ecological economical

86
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,080
social and maybe

87
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,680
informational sustainability here um so

88
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,040
you could say sustainability means

89
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,680
a stable uh condition somehow with a

90
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,000
good life

91
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,599
that provides a good life for everyone

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,519
um

93
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,840
well first i start with the um

94
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,000
ecological

95
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,239
um sustainability

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,920
some maybe some data on the material

97
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,799
footprint of the digital systems we're

98
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,319
using

99
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,000
one percent of the global emissions are

100
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,119
online videos

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,040
um that's 80 of all data traffic

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,200
if you add hardware and everything uh

103
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,640
you're maybe around a few percent in

104
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,879
energy use for

105
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,399
uh for those systems um maybe one

106
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,239
gigabyte in transfer

107
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,400
traffic needs around uh 0.06

108
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,879
kilowatt hours so that's kind of one

109
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,519
hour of netflix it's a

110
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,480
half an hour 30 watts light bulb plus

111
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,120
minus

112
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,000
however if we take the example of

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,519
netflix

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
they try to be co2 neutral by themselves

115
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,639
but

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,238
uh of course they are intermediaries um

117
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,359
which cannot be controlled so we see

118
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,239
it's not that easy

119
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,880
um just to say you know i'm i i try to

120
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,199
be a

121
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,040
climate neutral um some people say

122
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,880
google use the same amount of energy as

123
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,680
the city of san francisco

124
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,000
um at one point google says they have

125
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,040
for

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,160
40 energy saving applied right now

127
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,040
however the rebound effect kicks in if

128
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,880
you say that

129
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,479
maybe 100 new data centers are being

130
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,400
built um

131
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,758
so you know it's it's really really not

132
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,638
so easy to to

133
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,840
to count those numbers um in germany

134
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,080
there are data centers

135
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,599
uh that last year took the energy of

136
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,639
four media besides co-four

137
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,360
uh coal-fired power plants um according

138
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,280
to bitcom

139
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,039
and that's maybe 10 of the electricity

140
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,479
generation in germany for internet

141
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,240
related things

142
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,639
um so what i'm trying to say here is

143
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,600
that

144
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,000
uh all those numbers you can always it's

145
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,639
not so

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,080
easy to put to put a clear number on on

147
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,120
consumption if we take

148
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,440
energy uh production um

149
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,120
into account if it's all renewably

150
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,160
created so where's the problem

151
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,520
but still we have the hardware where

152
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,440
does it come from

153
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,440
and so all those questions are quite

154
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,280
quite complex

155
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,120
on the other hand you could also say

156
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,239
increasing

157
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,000
online usage of course online banking is

158
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,880
increasing but on the other hand you

159
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,800
may need less branch offices um but

160
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,639
maybe the back office is the same

161
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,840
uh the same question applies with

162
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,440
physical meetings or

163
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,960
video conferences which we have right

164
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,039
now the topic

165
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,198
um of course people are maybe then more

166
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,520
in home office um

167
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,400
less traveling less office use but on

168
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,198
the other hand

169
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,280
and it's not a very small point you have

170
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,520
heating costs and electricity generation

171
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,159
than on another place in another spot

172
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,960
maybe with a different kind of hardware

173
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,759
and because of

174
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,198
digitalization new behaviors emerge so

175
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,960
you can't really say

176
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,039
you know it's not so easy to say if this

177
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,799
gets less this gets more so this is

178
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,840
those are complicated aspects um

179
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,240
so what i'm trying to say here is it's

180
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,080
not so easy if we look at certain small

181
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,240
aspects to see if it's good or not

182
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,840
but we have to we have to put a target

183
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,400
we have to put a goal

184
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,159
in the terms of economic uh ecological

185
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,560
sustainability this is

186
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:42,319
um right now we have emissions

187
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:45,280
and there's a 66 chance for 1.5 degrees

188
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,000
um with a certain budget right now that

189
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,280
means

190
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,360
this budget if we take business as usual

191
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,198
we have around eight years time globally

192
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,319
and then we have to cut to zero to stay

193
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,599
within this

194
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,919
in this limits um or you can also

195
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,199
if you like not factually argument but

196
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,240
politically argue

197
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:07,039
uh to stay within the paris agreement so

198
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,000
uh which limits kind of the the

199
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,080
emissions

200
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,599
and so this is the goal the goal is not

201
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,199
you know how can we save it a little bit

202
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,120
here a little bit there but we have

203
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,240
we have to look at those indicators but

204
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,000
of course there are other aspects of

205
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,599
sustainability and this is where it

206
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,880
gets really interesting um

207
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:28,400
it gets really interesting for

208
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,880
our movement or for the idea

209
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,880
because we have the informational world

210
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,400
connected to economical and social and

211
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,919
informational sustainability so

212
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,080
i said before um we're shifting our

213
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,240
lives into technical dependency somehow

214
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,280
we need digital infrastructures that are

215
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,560
independent from individual use

216
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,479
we have data information on knowledge

217
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,240
that's being reflected within all those

218
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,120
digital infrastructures so how do we

219
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,919
deal with this

220
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,639
what does sustainability mean in this

221
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,120
aspect

222
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,680
uh concerning also the software use we

223
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,759
use

224
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,000
and also concerning political processes

225
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,800
that are maybe enabled by technology and

226
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,919
also

227
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:14,560
um um

228
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:16,479
uh and also technology has to be

229
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,879
made more part of democratic and

230
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,919
negotiating processes

231
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,840
um you could also look at for example

232
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,400
internet and advertising where

233
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,440
uh right now the ad industry is just

234
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,359
used for increased

235
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,280
in consumption so you see a very clear

236
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,000
connection here between sustainability

237
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,439
and

238
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,120
um digitalization

239
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,680
um and this also part of

240
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,880
us always constantly using new devices

241
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,000
if the old ones break

242
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,680
or if they're not usable anymore so it's

243
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,760
resource consumption as a whole

244
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,519
which is a problem and which is directly

245
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,800
at the at the corner of digitalization

246
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,320
and sustainability

247
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,319
but who can also look at digital rights

248
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,200
management is repairing allowed

249
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,480
sharing allowed and we look at the

250
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,720
economic parts

251
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,640
of monopolies privacy and surveillance

252
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,440
what does it mean when there's a lot of

253
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,880
power over societies and individuals

254
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,360
how does it influence democratic

255
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,560
processes this is also directly in the

256
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,600
middle of those

257
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,800
those two topics um

258
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,360
so you could also say there's a

259
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,079
representative crisis in democracy

260
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,839
since many people support a shift to

261
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,680
sustainability

262
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,519
but somehow it doesn't reflect in

263
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,640
policies

264
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,360
so there's a there's a big problem

265
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,000
and we also come to problematic

266
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,760
questions

267
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,279
like um if free software was

268
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,600
everywhere but we should have a look at

269
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,200
how

270
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,519
this free software is being created if

271
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,160
this is a hobby project of a person

272
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,440
um then it's it's there's little real

273
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,800
reliability

274
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,200
but this is of course not a problem of

275
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,439
free software but how how could we

276
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,560
create an environment where free free

277
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,640
software is the norm

278
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,560
and where the people who work there are

279
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,480
not close to burnout all the time

280
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,000
so how to create stable communities

281
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,320
maybe this is also something to learn

282
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,680
from the sustainability's

283
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,680
sustainability folks

284
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,640
yeah other aspects are maybe electricity

285
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,880
and transport grids that needs to be

286
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,399
updated uh and changed according to

287
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,000
sustainability gold

288
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,640
a lot of it is needed there and

289
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
if we take let's say the i.t people into

290
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,839
those discussions which

291
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,600
are already there of course but that

292
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,920
doesn't make it

293
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,079
so easy for the sustainability people to

294
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,160
fall for the usual blockchain and ai

295
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,920
scam

296
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,240
as the last interesting topic is maybe

297
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,519
trade agreements

298
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,079
where usually more and more there is i.t

299
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,040
policy

300
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,239
included um and those are questions of

301
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,240
sovereignty and

302
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,360
control especially uh for the countries

303
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,519
in the global south

304
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,480
so you so we see uh there's a lot

305
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,399
connected here

306
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,440
if we open this box um maybe

307
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,959
yeah this box so interestingly we

308
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,000
somehow know what to do

309
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,920
but the client so we need to limit

310
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,640
global warning by limiting efficient

311
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,560
emissions uh maybe some people suggest

312
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,120
co2 budgets or caps

313
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,199
we need to abolish subsidies roll out

314
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,200
renewable energies

315
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,440
we need more more sustainable mobility

316
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,959
concepts uh maybe vegetarian food

317
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,560
regional seasonal

318
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,359
um down to changing the whole economic

319
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,319
system

320
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,440
and in all those aspects we see um

321
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,320
digitalization

322
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,560
plays a crucial role there um how do we

323
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,640
internalize external analyses how we do

324
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,079
how do we break up monopolies i mean we

325
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,480
see that right now

326
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,359
with facebook with google with all those

327
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,959
big companies

328
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,800
is it a problem with check or the

329
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,399
problem with monopolies or is it a

330
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,839
combination of both

331
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,160
um and we also should ask

332
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,360
with the application of technology is

333
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,920
the use case

334
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,959
does it really help with sustainability

335
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,199
um

336
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,279
we all know the paperless office which

337
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,959
now has more paper than before

338
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,639
so obviously computers did not help in

339
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,560
this aspect but those are the points

340
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,240
where we need to take a closer look

341
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,160
what technological solutions actually

342
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,000
provide

343
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,160
on the social level we have to stop

344
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,519
exploitation

345
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,719
check about fair distribution of

346
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,600
benefits of productivity

347
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,839
and uh finally uh informational we have

348
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,000
to take data protection seriously

349
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,680
um maybe you think about common space

350
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,760
peer production in hard-earned software

351
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,920
but then also other digital goods

352
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,600
uh and think about free knowledge uh

353
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,519
open knowledge and free cultural

354
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,519
products

355
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,880
saying that free always doesn't mean it

356
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,399
not it doesn't have to

357
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,839
it doesn't mean that it doesn't have to

358
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:51,120
cost anything but it's not restricting

359
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,360
so as you might see now this is very

360
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,399
very complex

361
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,440
this was a very very complex bunch of

362
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,440
questions and and

363
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,560
so at one point a group of people

364
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:08,720
decided to make a conference in 2018

365
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:12,800
maybe a small view backwards

366
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:16,000
um so a group of organizations

367
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,040
found each other i could say i don't

368
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,720
want to read all of them

369
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,240
right now but the idea was to bring

370
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,760
together environmental folks

371
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,360
the hackers and techies and the

372
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,000
development folks

373
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,240
to talk exactly about those topics so

374
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,480
that everyone could bring in their

375
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,320
abilities and their knowledge and then

376
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,399
to to get in contact with each other and

377
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,440
connect the

378
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,399
communities um with the goal

379
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,360
of a common livable future for all and

380
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,639
the world for all

381
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,800
of course that includes a clean

382
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,880
atmosphere and that also

383
00:13:44,800 --> 00:14:02,479
needs a clean data atmosphere

384
00:13:48,880 --> 00:14:05,920
yes okay um

385
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,920
okay and um

386
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,440
so the the idea was then the reflection

387
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,880
on the relation of uh

388
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,720
digitalization and sustainability um

389
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,040
and but also sustainability strategies

390
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,279
for projects and

391
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,439
also to bring in ideas like convivial

392
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,199
technology

393
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,959
especially interesting i found the

394
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,680
discussion about the means and purpose

395
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,920
relationship

396
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,719
you could say digitalization is a means

397
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,920
and sustainability maybe is a purpose

398
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,440
uh so like growth which is not an end in

399
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,800
itself but it should help but if it

400
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,399
doesn't help we should stop it so the

401
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,599
same question you could make

402
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:45,120
for digitalization in certain aspects

403
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,600
um because right now how we digitally

404
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,240
say

405
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,639
do this this kind of digitalization um

406
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,519
it's

407
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,760
just putting fire oil to the fire but of

408
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,920
course the question is not yes no but

409
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,519
what do we do and how do we do do we use

410
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,040
centralized systems or decentralized

411
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,560
systems

412
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,560
and all those questions

413
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,800
yes and as a result

414
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,040
of this conference there were some

415
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,399
concrete demands that came out

416
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,599
i don't want to go into details so all

417
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,480
of them you can check them out on the

418
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,480
website

419
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,480
uh but the first point was social

420
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,680
ecological objectives and the design of

421
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,600
digitalization

422
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,359
so social environmental and development

423
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,079
policy as well as peace objectives

424
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,480
should be part

425
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,319
of the direction where we're going right

426
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,000
we'll talk about technology

427
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,680
so we can shape it as we need it um

428
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,279
and it should also foster human rights

429
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,880
climate protection goals as well as the

430
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,399
end of hunger and poverty because this

431
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,600
is the ultimate goal

432
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,959
um and the all the other demands you can

433
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,639
you can check out yourself

434
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,319
later um as you see it goes from data

435
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,360
protection monopolies democracy

436
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,279
education

437
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,839
so all the questions somehow i've been

438
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,880
addressing before

439
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,399
we try to put it in the shape that's

440
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,240
easy to understand so it's a small

441
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,680
leaflet actually

442
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,199
and it's supported by at least in german

443
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,920
major organizations from the

444
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,319
hacker area the tech area and also the

445
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,399
sustainability and ecological area

446
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,399
so i'm not going into those details

447
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,880
right now

448
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,680
but the question was then okay we can't

449
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,680
control

450
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,079
and we don't want to control this whole

451
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:28,239
thing so that's why we said

452
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:30,719
um um everyone can use the

453
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,240
the bits uh bits of boeing label as as

454
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,240
they please if they

455
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,800
adhere to some of our let's say rules

456
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,759
uh you have to like work on this in this

457
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,680
direction of the

458
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,360
digitalization and sustainability you

459
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,680
have to concentrate on activist science

460
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,360
and cyber civil society as we know

461
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,279
um um that companies and uh

462
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,720
especially politicians have their

463
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,800
platforms already so

464
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,480
we want to give a voice to the less hurt

465
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,959
and in our view

466
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,600
more competent uh actors most of the

467
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,199
time

468
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,360
if you support the demands and you live

469
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,119
the motto um

470
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,640
so you you organize those events

471
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,719
according to those principles

472
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,919
anyone can use uh the bits employment

473
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,600
label as they want

474
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,280
we have the local material under free

475
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,399
licenses you can ask for help

476
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,199
under the gun bits and bomber dot org if

477
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,400
you like and the result was overwhelming

478
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,720
we have branches pun intended um in

479
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,160
dresden in berlin in hanover in dortmund

480
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,679
osnabrucken

481
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,280
um and you have they come from different

482
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,880
areas some are closer to the chaos

483
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,200
family some are closer to the

484
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,960
of knowledge foundation family some are

485
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,840
coming just from university backgrounds

486
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,799
some come

487
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,199
from uh yeah all kinds of backgrounds we

488
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:46,000
have mailing lists the forum matrix chat

489
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,200
and um there's even an assembly here at

490
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,760
uh rc3

491
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,520
you can check it out if you find it um

492
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,799
it's always part of the game

493
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,879
um and tonight today at nine

494
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,639
um there will also be a matrix chat you

495
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,480
can find all this on the website

496
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:05,280
uh you can check out the um

497
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,600
um the videos of the conference uh that

498
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,639
have

499
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,399
had been taking place and um yeah

500
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,640
so that's that's kind of the whole

501
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,600
movement that's why it got decentralized

502
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:19,280
and it's a really good idea

503
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,918
as it turned out so finally

504
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,639
we get to the last point the way to act

505
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,640
well

506
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,400
of course individual action is good you

507
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,039
know if you say i want to be streaming

508
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,320
with less

509
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,480
resolution that's that's totally fine

510
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,320
but it's always clear to state that

511
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,720
there's a structural problem here

512
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,879
we have a total asymmetry with um

513
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,240
with a lot of subsidies making the

514
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,760
cheapest and the most

515
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:49,039
easy option for everything from food

516
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:52,080
uh to electronics the actually most um

517
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:55,360
dangerous one for um for

518
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,080
climate uh for um avoiding a global

519
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,678
warming

520
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,280
and so this is something that really

521
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,320
needs to straight stop

522
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,320
um and needs to be changed in policy but

523
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,439
that shouldn't stop us from also

524
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,720
starting with small

525
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,120
experimental projects with lab projects

526
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,679
with

527
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,600
software projects um shape local groups

528
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,120
go to regulars table well we should

529
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,280
organize somehow

530
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,280
um and you can come of course to bits

531
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,000
and boymo in those different cities if

532
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,039
you want

533
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,480
or connect um to the uh

534
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:30,400
to the online events so um

535
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,559
and sometimes maybe it's okay to just uh

536
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,120
switch off the computer and go outside

537
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,879
but i want to finish uh with a quote

538
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,639
from joseph weitzebaum

539
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,919
the question is not how digitalization

540
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,120
changes society

541
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:46,000
but how society uses digitalization um

542
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,479
and we try to suggest one way of making

543
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,480
it usable

544
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,840
globally for a good life for all and

545
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,159
i hope that was not too much and too

546
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,918
fast but now i'm happy to get

547
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,480
feedback and questions if there are any

548
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,480
thanks a lot

549
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,760
hi i hope you can hear me rainer thank

550
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,520
you very much for your talk

551
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,760
um we are right now uh asking again on

552
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,600
the chats and on social media to post

553
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,799
questions about your talk

554
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,360
maybe we can begin so did you expect

555
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,320
this to become some kind of distributed

556
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:28,399
movement something that started from one

557
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:31,600
from event really um

558
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,400
we have actually not planned this but

559
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,678
um later on we found out that it's it's

560
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,200
impossible to

561
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,960
um first to contain it which we also

562
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,080
don't want but it's also not possible to

563
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,440
coordinate this

564
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,840
because uh some of us are um

565
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,880
volunteers especially in the tech in the

566
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,760
tech area

567
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,240
so this is this is just um not possible

568
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,640
and it

569
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,919
i mean decentralizing decentralization

570
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,760
is always a good thing

571
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,360
that's why we put up those principles

572
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,240
but from the beginning on that was not

573
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,360
the idea but

574
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,080
somehow it got to life and

575
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,559
it turns out it was a good idea because

576
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,960
at least

577
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,039
in the german speaking area this label

578
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,559
has become

579
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,720
something like an indicator for a

580
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,399
certain discourse if we think for

581
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,880
example uh zuka healthy

582
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,440
she organized the project 10 years ago

583
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,840
jeans

584
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,039
bites and emissions that always already

585
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,678
tried this

586
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,280
um but then they came different names

587
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,640
and different discourses so

588
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:33,200
it was hard to trace to trace that back

589
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,840
but maybe it works at this kind of open

590
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,080
label

591
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,760
uh also helps that people who work on

592
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,918
the same

593
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,799
not same issues also find each other

594
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,799
better somehow

595
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,039
so we got a question on the chair xian

596
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,960
is asking does this mean that there are

597
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,799
no big bits and bomber conferences in

598
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,840
the near future

599
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:58,320
um no that does not mean that it's

600
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,320
it's let's say

601
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,520
there might certainly be a big bitsy

602
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,480
bomber conference in the future

603
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,200
but this should not keep anyone from

604
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,360
organizing

605
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,360
small ones or other big ones but i'm

606
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,039
let's say um

607
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,399
some seeds might be already planted and

608
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,400
let's see what's happening

609
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,600
that's good we have another question

610
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,159
coming up right now um

611
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,719
and i seem to have lost it no are there

612
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,440
any distributed online events or meetups

613
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,960
uh one could join i think he went into

614
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,400
this a bit in the end but maybe you

615
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,080
could repeat that where people who are

616
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,520
now interested in this can

617
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:45,199
actually meet others yes uh definitely

618
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,720
um not only because of the um pandemic

619
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,960
situation right now

620
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,600
um but there are meetups planned also

621
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,919
for uh 2021 but of course i'm 20 it's

622
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,719
not

623
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,120
that long anymore um you could check out

624
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,559
uh

625
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,559
on the website um

626
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,480
on the website up there uh there's a

627
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,559
connection to the forum

628
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:10,159
and to make it and matrix chat

629
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:12,480
and um there we will uh there were

630
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,919
not we i'm also not that connect but i

631
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,919
know it will take place

632
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,559
um uh there you can find the connection

633
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,080
to those

634
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,720
local uh tables and the plan for 2021 is

635
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,240
to have

636
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,120
a one a bigger exchange that goes just

637
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,840
across

638
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,918
across the cities and um i think this is

639
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,600
this is the place to go to check

640
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,360
but this is definitely definitely in

641
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,039
plan and this is a

642
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,879
certainly a good idea so i mean you

643
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,400
you did this talking english right now

644
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,640
despite this being something that

645
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,200
originated in germany here what's

646
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,799
basically the internationalization idea

647
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,880
you have in mind

648
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:56,639
exactly so so the idea was somehow um

649
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:59,840
uh that uh a lot of those

650
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,120
um the work we we've been doing and

651
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,199
coordinating

652
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:08,239
um i see that that uh

653
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,320
um it's necessary to distribute this

654
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,919
to to somehow say hey uh people have

655
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,639
been thinking about this already

656
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,039
and for example in the conference 2018

657
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,120
um

658
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,360
already the talks uh all of the talks

659
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:23,439
have been translated to english as well

660
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:26,240
um so if you check also at media cccde

661
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,039
you can always choose the language track

662
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,480
english

663
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,679
and but i just or we just noticed that

664
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,400
this was nice for the people who have

665
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,039
been there but it has not gained broad

666
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,880
attention

667
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:40,799
and um so this is just an idea to to

668
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,640
maybe find others who've been working

669
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,240
into this in this direction

670
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,400
to see that there's there are other

671
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,919
initiatives working and then to

672
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,000
join powers and somehow try to

673
00:24:49,919 --> 00:25:01,840
steer the ship into a more sunny

674
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:01,840
direction again

675
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,520
um i can't hear you talking right now

676
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,840
sorry yeah i didn't want to okay i'll

677
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,919
just say again

678
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,760
i wanted to say there's another uh

679
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,000
question coming in

680
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,120
i'm coolly just asking where can i see

681
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,960
some of the projects

682
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,239
uh that took place in the past two years

683
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,919
since conference

684
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,360
i guess the answer again is your website

685
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:33,039
maybe um yes

686
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:36,158
uh it's partly but um it's partly a bit

687
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:39,679
um distributed um

688
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:43,200
first the website is a good start um

689
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:47,039
but um let me see

690
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,520
um there have been uh conferences

691
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,240
in dresden for example which you can

692
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,879
access

693
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,440
yes via the website but

694
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,520
dresden.bitsembomimer.org so you can

695
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,159
find the documentation there

696
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,799
um but there's i think in the forum

697
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,679
would be a good

698
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,240
idea to ask there if you can't find uh

699
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,720
all those

700
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,320
uh other things and there have been also

701
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,400
smaller events like on the internet

702
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,000
governance forum 2019 where we were

703
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,840
present on dina at the great

704
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,679
transformation conference or the um

705
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,120
or the forum which takes place every i

706
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,000
think three months

707
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,799
um which is a discussion format in

708
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,240
berlin

709
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:27,039
um always to certain topics

710
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,640
and we try to somehow announce it on the

711
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,440
website to get this together but

712
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,480
um as i said uh if if people would like

713
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,240
to join

714
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,000
um it's we're happy if you're a

715
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,799
visionary and bring in your ideas and

716
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,640
your content

717
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,639
that's really great but with all

718
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,000
projects it is also nice if you say

719
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,760
well i actually think it's interesting

720
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,279
what's happening there i don't have the

721
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,520
big vision but

722
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,520
i'm happy with uh tracing what has been

723
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,918
happening and putting it in our

724
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,158
history log in the calendar which we

725
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,120
already have in a very basic structure

726
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,720
um this is also greatly helped so that

727
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,320
other people don't have this to do this

728
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,480
work twice

729
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,840
so that's why um you will find some of

730
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,760
them on the website but not all of it

731
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:11,039
um but we're happy

732
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,279
uh if this could be maybe uh archived in

733
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,600
a more structured way

734
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,880
yeah that's also always very important

735
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,799
with community work to

736
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,000
to put in the hours and actually do the

737
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,158
archiving work so that

738
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
it's preserved for anything that comes

739
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,640
comes up later yes

740
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,520
yeah yeah i mean yeah sure definitely so

741
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,440
just as common

742
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,799
this is this is a classic example as

743
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,440
well of sustainability

744
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,879
like how do you create a sustainable

745
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,120
project or sustainable

746
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,679
community of course if new people come

747
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,600
in um

748
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,960
where do they start you need some kind

749
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,439
of memory

750
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,520
uh for this in an organizational way and

751
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,679
so this is a very interesting instance

752
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,080
of what sustainability also can mean

753
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,039
it's it's it doesn't always have to be

754
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,279
um

755
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,879
some crazy new ideas but if we think

756
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,480
about the digital archiving and all

757
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,279
those questions this is this is all part

758
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,320
of it

759
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:04,320
of getting a livable digital environment

760
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,279

761
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,840
