[Music]

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,960
[Applause]

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,599
[Laughter]

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,519
from

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,600
peer-to-peer interactions to global

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,000
media and how both can work together to

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,160
create

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
rooted and resilient networks of meaning

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,600
a sustained level of science-based

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,800
awareness and engagement on climate

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,640
change

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,560
first i'll explain how to translate

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,320
climate science to the public

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,919
second i'll describe how connecting with

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,280
people as individuals

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,680
to their identities values and

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,000
worldviews can help them care more about

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,120
climate change third i'll identify

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,160
narratives

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,160
with global appeal

21
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,640
finally i'll explore how you can combine

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,399
multiple climate talking points to

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,920
greater effect

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,920
what this working covers is that a

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,840
deeper ecological

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,920
ideological shift is necessary to live

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,440
sustainably and ensuring we do for

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,280
generations to come

29
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,120
we all have to work together to write

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,879
the story of how we get better

31
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,239
in this way the story becomes a

32
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,640
metaphorical forest

33
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,680
made up of emergent evolving dying

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,600
repurposed

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,840
and ultimately connected and mutually

36
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,839
reinforcing climate change narratives

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,600
the ipcc report says limiting global

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,759
warming to 1.5 celsius

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,919
will require rapid far-reaching and

40
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,040
unprecedented changes in all aspects of

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,360
society

42
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,520
the required speed scale and granularity

43
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,280
of these changes can be intimidating

44
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,520
the good news is climate science has

45
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,920
already revealed many helpful actions we

46
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,920
can take

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,600
tree planning keeping fossil fuels in

48
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,439
the ground and

49
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
transitioning to renewables like solar

50
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,199
and wind as well as transforming how we

51
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,600
grow our food and what we eat

52
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,040
for example by increasing gardening and

53
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,199
veganism in cities

54
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,799
and radically decreasing consumption are

55
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,200
just some of the many ways we can lower

56
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,840
greenhouse gas emissions

57
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,640
and co2 biodiversity loss and climate

58
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,600
change

59
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,600
so what's stopping us

60
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,840
when the ipcc report calls for changes

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,360
in all aspects of society

62
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,360
this implies that successful climate

63
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,200
change mitigation and adaptation

64
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,800
would require their efforts of all

65
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,560
aspects of society

66
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,000
as we increasingly experience the felt

67
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,680
effects of climate change

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,599
like hotter some of the many ways from

69
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,360
wild or winter climate change is

70
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,079
increasingly becoming a concern to the

71
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
public

72
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,400
shaping voting patterns consumer

73
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,280
behaviors careers and more

74
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,560
but it hasn't always been this way

75
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,319
climate change is already hard to

76
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,760
communicate because it's been relatively

77
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,440
invisible to people

78
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,040
we also haven't been able to communicate

79
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,920
climate science in a way that people

80
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,239
understand

81
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,319
and that motivates them to change

82
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,000
despite waves of environmental movements

83
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,839
climate change remained a relatively

84
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,879
economically politically and socially

85
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,120
marginalized issue

86
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,720
until quite recently and didn't gather

87
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,319
the diverse skill sets needed

88
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,760
to secure sufficient political and

89
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,920
public buy-in

90
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,679
for this reason climate scientists nobly

91
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,238
rose the challenge of also communicating

92
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,000
the science

93
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,920
however communications is its own

94
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,440
science and to do it well also

95
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,958
necessitates a lot of training

96
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,480
experience domain knowledge and

97
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,720
specialization

98
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,720
and informing and motivating people to

99
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,480
act on climate is difficult enough

100
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,319
without well-funded disinformation

101
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,679
campaigns and lobbying by the fossil

102
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,359
fuel industry

103
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,440
climate communications is therefore a

104
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,040
relatively new career path

105
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,280
full of uncertainty and a need to

106
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,040
experiment feed on errors

107
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,560
and learn quickly and iterate online

108
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,280
it's difficult the benefit of such a

109
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,879
context

110
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,799
is it hasn't inherited a legacy of

111
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,000
dominant dogmatic and in principle

112
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,519
assertions

113
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,280
endemic to some other discipline

114
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,080
communications which reveal problematic

115
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,040
idealizations of our cognitive power

116
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,959
for now it exists more in practice

117
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,239
focusing on practice on

118
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,000
the chance to correctly position

119
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,120
knowledge as cumulative and up for

120
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,120
revision

121
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,720
an honest reckoning with human cognitive

122
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,720
limitations and possibilities

123
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,480
first there are a few guidelines for

124
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,120
communicating climate science that have

125
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,518
been found to work well

126
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,159
communicate using plain language be

127
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,480
concise

128
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,599
and get to the point quickly repeat the

129
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,000
same messages

130
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,679
connect felt effects to climate science

131
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,399
stay positive

132
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,840
use trusted messengers communicate using

133
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,679
memorable stories

134
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,440
use visuals humor and other creative

135
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,479
forms of engagement

136
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,479
and encourage dialogue

137
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,719
when scientists talk about climate

138
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,600
models people can get lost in the

139
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,960
details

140
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,520
that's why it's advised to anchor

141
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,359
communications in the court facts

142
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,880
you might say global warming is an

143
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,440
increase in the earth's temperature

144
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,120
which changes climate patterns warming

145
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,639
happens when heat trapping gases are

146
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,120
released into the atmosphere

147
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,759
for example by burning fossil fuels like

148
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,440
coal oil and gas for energy

149
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,120
we're seeing the impacts now in more

150
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,199
frequent and severe heat waves

151
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,199
wildfires droughts and floods

152
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,199
25 years ago susan joy hassall was

153
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,639
working with climate scientists

154
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,440
on translating their findings to the

155
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,360
general public when no one else was

156
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,919
hustle says scientists use words the

157
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,160
public uses but to mean different things

158
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,840
for example scientists often use the

159
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,440
term positive feedback

160
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,119
which the public might associate to

161
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,240
receiving positive feedback on a job

162
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,080
well done

163
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320
however scientists use this to describe

164
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,198
a vicious cycle in the climate system

165
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,400
whereby warming causes even more warming

166
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,280
hassel says

167
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,638
there's about 150 words and expressions

168
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,400
that create differences

169
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,440
between the science and how it's

170
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,440
perceived by the public

171
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,560
climate communications research also

172
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,400
finds that certain words and concepts

173
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,000
have negative associations

174
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,599
and can make people more resistant to

175
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,120
propose solutions

176
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,880
especially if they're associated with

177
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,520
politics they don't agree with

178
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,159
some examples are regulate restrict cut

179
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,840
control

180
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,840
and tax

181
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,240
what alternate words and concepts can we

182
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,720
use then

183
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,400
some climate communication communicators

184
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,080
suggest using words like

185
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,840
entrepreneurship free market and

186
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,520
competition because they're well

187
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,520
received by the public

188
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,120
but this example reveals the largest

189
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,400
challenge climate communicators face

190
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,560
today

191
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,479
how can we motivate people using words

192
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,199
they connect with

193
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,758
but with also challenging the status quo

194
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,240
that is

195
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,199
the extractivism competition and

196
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,919
consumerism

197
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,240
driving climate change how do we inspire

198
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,520
new

199
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,680
and necessary sustainable ways of being

200
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,719
if you pound into comfort zones nothing

201
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,479
changes

202
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,759
if you present something alienating

203
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,560
people dig their heels in

204
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,160
and nothing changes in this line of work

205
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,360
these mistips can literally feel like

206
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,600
the end of the world

207
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,520
but they will and must happen as i

208
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,639
mentioned earlier this discipline is new

209
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,960
and there are no silver bullet

210
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,840
communication strategies there's only

211
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,758
humility

212
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,239
learning by doing near constant

213
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,720
iteration and humble successes

214
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,720
for now

215
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,720
but we're not totally in the dark

216
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,720
there's evidence supporting the idea

217
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,960
that messages resonate more with people

218
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,960
when they connect to them personally

219
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,719
to their identities values world views

220
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,799
etc

221
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,639
and among climate communicators this

222
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,919
approach is recognized as particularly

223
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,919
effective

224
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,680
interestingly however most of our

225
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,639
engagement activities are still tailored

226
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,560
towards the general public

227
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,160
the reason could be that that

228
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,000
approaching climate communications with

229
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,400
this level of granularity

230
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,639
at scale is an intimidating task but

231
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,000
some organizations are trying it

232
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,720
climate outreach is one such

233
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,560
organization it specializes in how to

234
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,319
engage hard to reach audiences

235
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,160
developing climate connection programs

236
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,919
with communities such as youth

237
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,520
center right faith and migraine groups

238
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,960
there are some general guidelines for

239
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,639
connecting to individuals that have been

240
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,159
found to work well

241
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,800
understand what the audience knows and

242
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,479
doesn't know identify their identity

243
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,199
values world rules beliefs

244
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,240
attitudes etc connect with what matters

245
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,479
to them

246
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,680
use a shared language use trusted

247
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,199
messengers

248
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,840
frame climate changes personally

249
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,840
relevant and provide tangible examples

250
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:13,758
help them realize what they can do and

251
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:15,039
key actions they can take

252
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,240
climate outreach says there are

253
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,800
different ways to understand your

254
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,960
audience

255
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,919
so you can tailor your messaging for

256
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,400
example

257
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,680
surveys focus groups and stakeholder

258
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,840
engagement

259
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,919
additionally testing strategies

260
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,520
narratives and communications materials

261
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,240
with a sample of your target audience

262
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,559
helps god's

263
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,560
engage reactions and avoid backlash

264
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,239
climate outreach's global narratives

265
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,079
approach is the first initiative to

266
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,799
develop communications methodology

267
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,480
to build capacity in specific locations

268
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,160
to train local organizations

269
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,160
in testing and developing effective

270
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,000
climate communications

271
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,600
the global south has been particularly

272
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,440
neglected in this regard

273
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,839
with most climate narratives appealing

274
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,920
to appearing in global media

275
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,760
appealing to the global north as well as

276
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,959
to people who have already been engaged

277
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,040
on climate

278
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,719
climate outreach's global narratives

279
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,640
workshop leads participants through a

280
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,399
series of questions

281
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,560
what do you care about what do you

282
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,200
dislike what makes you proud of who you

283
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,640
are

284
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,880
how do you feel about your country and

285
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,319
your place in it what changes have you

286
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,760
noticed and what concerns do you have

287
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,279
about the future

288
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,040
what does it mean to you and what do you

289
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,880
think causes it

290
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,319
what are the impacts and how will you

291
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,560
and others cope

292
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,080
what do renewables mean to you and how

293
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,079
can they replace fossil fuels

294
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,440
after these conversations short prepared

295
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,560
narratives are handed out to

296
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,519
participants along with

297
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,199
red and green highlighters one by one

298
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,160
the facilitator reads out the narrative

299
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,839
to the group

300
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,519
and asks them to read it themselves and

301
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,519
highlight any words or passages they

302
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,240
feel strongly positive about in green

303
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,519
and strongly negative about in red when

304
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,680
the group discusses what they

305
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,040
highlighted and why

306
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,279
then the group discusses what they

307
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,120
highlighted and why later the marked

308
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,200
narratives are analyzed alongside

309
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,959
transcripts from the discussions in

310
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,880
order to generate recommendations

311
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,279
on what messaging to use and what to

312
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,279
avoid

313
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,680
finding that images of polar bears

314
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,040
melting ice caps and smoking chimneys

315
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,640
were relatively ineffective at

316
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,000
connecting with people

317
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,399
climate outreach realized that

318
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,560
developing a captivating diverse

319
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,839
and people-focused visual language was

320
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,518
necessary

321
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,200
that developed the climate visuals

322
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,519
website to support journalists

323
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,480
researchers campaigners photographers

324
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,120
and filmmakers

325
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,839
in telling powerful new visual stories

326
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,839
with local flavor

327
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,959
climate communications professionals can

328
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,839
also be strategic about the groups they

329
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,839
engage

330
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,600
for example with over 80 percent of the

331
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,279
world's population identifying as

332
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,040
belonging to a religion

333
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,040
and with houses of worship existing

334
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,640
nearly everywhere it would be wise to

335
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,439
consider how climate justice could be

336
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,279
relevant to these communities

337
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,279
the following is an example of how do

338
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,800
different people an atheist and a

339
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,800
christian may be motivated towards the

340
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,800
same climate action

341
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,240
a science-loving atheist may support

342
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,800
protecting forests

343
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,480
because forests remove co2 from the air

344
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,240
while a devout christian may care about

345
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,360
protecting forests because of the belief

346
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,800
that one must conserve

347
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,959
god's creation

348
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,640
the vast majority of europeans are very

349
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,959

worried about climate change

351
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,640

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,920
we've seen using trusted messengers

357

recommended a few times now

358
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,479
arguably the most powerful incarnation

359
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,319
of this is peer-to-peer communication

360
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,399
talking to partners friends and family

supported by eit climate kick was

365
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,880
designed to help people have

366
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,959
conversations about climate change in

their daily lives

the talking climate handbook suggests

369
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,440
you use

370
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,040
real talk in these conversations respect

371
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,320
your conversational partner and find

372
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,360
common ground

373
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,839
enjoy the conversation ask questions

374
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,720
listen and show you've heard tell your

375
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,800
story

376
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,200
action makes it easier but doesn't fix

377
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,479
it learn from the conversation

378
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,720
and keep going and keep connected these

379
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,480
same like obvious recommendations

380
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,120
but what they really are are ways to

381
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,680
ensure you maintain a good faith

382
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,680
conversation

383
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,760
once good faith is lost a conversation

384
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,680
on climate change may have the opposite

385
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,200
of your intended effect pushing your

386
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,638
conversational partner further into

387
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,560
skepticism or denial

388
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,200
nothing that we do no matter how

389
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,040
brilliant how technologically innovative

390
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,720
can reach the track the traction and

391
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,199
impact that we need it to be

392
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,120
unless we begin to very rapidly scale up

393
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,480
our insights and capacities for

394
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,320
understanding the psychological

395
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,600
dimension of climate change

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,480
eot climate kick offers a free online

398
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,600
course engaging people on climate change

399
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,200
it was co-created with dr lyrene latzman

400
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,680
who has focused on psychology and

401
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,279
climate change for a few decades now

402
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,199
the course identifies ways people

403
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,639
confront climate change information at a

404
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,399
psychological

405
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,839
level and how climate communicators

406
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,720
might help them move past their defense

407
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,560
mechanisms

408
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,320
people's powerful response to climate

409
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,518
change can interfere with their ability

410
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,519
to take action

411
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,320
when presented with challenging

412
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,638
information that clashes with who they

413
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,200
are

414
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,399
and what they care about people can have

415
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,279
feelings like guilt

416
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,880
shame and powerlessness such feelings

417
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,880
can trigger internal conflict

418
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,000
like cognitive dissonance and defense

419
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,839
mechanisms

420
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,560
including denial disavow and

421
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,320
rationalizing

422
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,920
traditional communications approaches

423
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,680
like educating cheerleading

424
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,439
enticing nudging fear and writing reflex

425
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,120
and the writing reflex that is the

426
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,880
strong urge to tell people the solution

427
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,760
to their problem because we feel we know

428
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,560
it would work can be counterproductive

429
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,160
they can trigger defense mechanisms by

430
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,079
understanding the psychology of people's

431
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,760
reactions to climate change we can start

432
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,599
to imagine ways to get through to them

433
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,360
instead of pounding away at this with

434
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,360
the same and personal arguments

435
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,760
we need to have conversations that take

436
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,079
a human or society-centered approach

437
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,519
this could entail for example making a

438
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,000
reflection or summary of what your

439
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,839
conversational partner is saying

440
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,399
emphasizing whatever changed talk you've

441
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,040
heard and asking for clarification

442
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,560
thereby avoiding the writing reflex the

443
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,240
goal is to have your conversational

444
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,040
partner fit climate action into their

445
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,040
life

446
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:45,040
in a way that makes sense for them not

447
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,040
for you to do it for them

448
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,480
we've explored bottom-up individualized

449
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,480
climate communications

450
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,480
and learned this requires quite a bit of

451
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,639
resources like research

452
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,000
the construction of multiple narratives

453
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,600
and people on the ground willing to

454
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,680
engage their peers

455
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,639
for this reason possible top-down

456
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,199
approaches

457
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,360
with the potential of more for less

458
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,319
become incredibly tantalizing

459
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,760
so are there any as we gather more data

460
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,120
on what connects to different identities

461
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,079
values and worldviews

462
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,160
some common themes emerge i call these

463
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,160
narratives with mass resonance

464
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,439
they are intergenerational

465
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:27,839
responsibility

466
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:27,839
public health and prosperity

467
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,440
climate change legal actions have been

468
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,440
attempted since the 90s

469
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,199
these cases typically involve youth and

470
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,959
children as they represent the class

471
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,920
most affected by government action

472
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,399
or inaction however such cases have

473
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,920
generally been dismissed

474
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,440
in august 2018 at age 15 greta thunder

475
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,120
started spending her school days outside

476
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,279
the swedish parliament to call for

477
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,360
stronger action on climate change

478
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,040
by holding up a sign reading schools

479
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,519
strike for climate

480
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,680
by 2019 there are multiple coordinated

481
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,680
city protests happening around the globe

482
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,040
each involving over a million people

483
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,719
mostly students

484
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,480
her impact on the world stage has been

485
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,480
described as the greta effect

486
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,519
greta's main talking point is that

487
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,759
climate change will have a

488
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,000
disproportionate effect on young people

489
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,839
and that their futures are being stolen

490
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,880
this involves the concept of earth

491
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,040
overshoot

492
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,880
that is adults are consuming so

493
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,000
excessively they're using up the earth's

494
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,040
resources

495
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,639
like freshwater forests fish stocks etc

496
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,839
beyond their ability to regenerate and

497
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,839
provide for future generations

498
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,079
it's difficult to to quantify the

499
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,680
effectiveness of the greta effect

500
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,599
motivating millions upon millions of

501
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,359
people to engage in political activism

502
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,120
for the environment does spread

503
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,560
awareness of climate science

504
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,800
generate a critical mass of public

505
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,560
engagement for politicians to see

506
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,399
and has undeniably helped normalize

507
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,758
climate change as a topic in the public

508
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,040
discourse

509
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,480
in june 2019 a yougov poll in britain

510
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,079
found that public concern about the

511
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,880
environment had reached record

512
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,879
levels in the uk since sun bird and

513
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,839
extinction rebellion have quote pierced

514
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,839
the bubble of denial

515
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,919
in february 2019 thunder shared a stage

516
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,880
with the then president of the european

517
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,240
commission

518
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,720
jean-claude juncker where he claimed

519
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,559
in the next financial period from 2021

520
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,480

climate change climate change has also

525
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,080
played a significant role in the

european

527
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,720
parliament elections in may 2019

528
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,280

531
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,439
many of the gains came from northern

532
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,120
european countries where young people

533
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,039
have taken to the streets during fridays

dollars

billion earth fund

552

however activists are justifiably

553
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,919
skeptical about the mega rich's

554

commitment to effectively dismantling

build their wealth upon

557
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,480
blunberg can also be credited with

558
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,799
accelerating the anti-flying movement

559
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,480
by promoting train travel instead the

560
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,879
buzzword associated with this movement

561
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,360
is

562
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,080
flight shame it's a phenomenon in which

563
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,320
free

564
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,320
people feel social pressure not to fly

565
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,120
because of associated emissions

566
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,439
and climate change for example traveling

567
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,439
from

568
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,320
london to amsterdam by train instead of

569
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,320
plane cuts co2 emissions by 83 percent

570
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,160
sweden reported a 4 drop in domestic air

571
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,400
travel for 2019

572
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,240
and an increase in rail and the number

573
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,039
of people flying between german cities

meanwhile deutsche band has reported

577

record passenger numbers

578
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,559
in september germany's parliament voted

579
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,559
in a climate package

580
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,280
including a tax cut aimed at reducing

581
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,520
train ticket prices by around 10

582
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,120
while deutsche band is planning for for

583
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,760
all their inter-city trains to run on

584
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,760
renewables

585
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,600
and yet we're beginning to see how these

586
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,919
larger narratives are less resilient

587
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,439
than peer-to-peer communications and are

588
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,960
particularly vulnerable to being

589
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,960
co-opted

590
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,039
recently a nineteen-year-old german

591
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,600
vlogger dubbed the anti-greta

592
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,919
naomi scythe was promoted heavily by

593
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,760
leading figures on the far right

595
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,360
politicians from the alternative before

deutschland ifd

597
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,600
party in court has been quoted as saying

598
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,480
climate change alarmism is at its very

599
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,799
core

600
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,240
a despicably human anti-human ideology

601
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,158
she's being paid by the heartland

602
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,280
institute a think tank closely allied

603
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,840
with the white house

604
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,559
to make climate denial videos one could

605
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,959
argue that

606
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,840
once a narrative movement etc becomes

607
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,320
large enough

608
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,840
it's vulnerable to being co-opted the

609
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,600
key is to ensure one is always

610
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,600
generating and framing the discourse

611
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,600
and is never in a reactive position

612
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,199
instead pushing into the ever new and

613
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,520
ever exciting edge of the

614
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,400
overton window and drawing the public

615
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,760
along

616
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,840
this is of course no easy task

617
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,799
economic political and social realities

618
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,918
help determine

619
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:42,720
which of these influencers or child gods

620
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,960
will be favored people who are insecure

621
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,159
lacking access to education and medicare

622
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,080
for example

623
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,200
and who live in societies with greater

624
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,520
wealth disparity

625
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,280
for example in the us are more likely to

626
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,200
support strongmen figures

627
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,399
playing to the plain to their defense

628
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,760
mechanisms

629
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,520
whereas those who are secure are

630
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,400
inclined to support figures advocating

631
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,840
for carriage

632
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,840
collectivism and action

633
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,600
climate change is a public health crisis

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,159
storms are increasing

637
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,080
as average temperatures rise so will

638
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,320
heat related disorders

639
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,080
air pollution and relatedly respiratory

640
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,320
illness can worsen

641
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,678
high co2 concentrations are associated

642
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,039
with decreased mental performance

643
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,559

well-being eco-anxiety

651
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,240
as we've stored earlier fewer narratives

652
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,919
like focusing only on climate change's

653
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,240
many adverse health effects

654
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,000
can trigger defense mechanisms this is

655
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,280
why the topic of public health must be

656
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,320
handled carefully

657
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,320
and even cleverly

658
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,799
we may look to a few historical examples

659
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,120
of moments when a public health crisis

660
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,039
fueled by environmental abuse mobilized

661
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,000
political action

662
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,000
in 1952 a thick layer of smog settled

663
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,760
over london england

664
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,520
this severe air pollution event was

665
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,080
caused by the city's excessive use of

666
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,879
coal

667
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,559
and lasted five days it's estimated up

668
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:29,200
to twelve thousand people died

669
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,200
and a hundred thousand war were made ill

670
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,960
environmental legislation since the

671
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,000
great smog of london

672
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,799
such as the city of london act 1954 and

673
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,240
the clean air

674
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,720
acts of 1956 and 68 introduced measures

675
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,720
to address

676
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,720
air pollution like the mandated movement

677
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,320
towards smokeless fuels

678
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,400
financial incentives were offered to

679
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,080
households to replace open coal fires

680
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,120
with alternatives

681
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,559
such as gas fires some talking points

682
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,039
used to gather support for such

683
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,639
measures were the social and economic

684
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,480
costs of air pollution

685
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,840
and that clean air was as important as

686
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,440
clean water

687
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,039
this is clever messaging because it

688
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,360
normalizes clean air

689
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,200
by comparing it to clean water which was

690
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,479
already viewed favorably and had been

691
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,600
successfully fought for

692
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,799
in the previous century why had it been

693
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,158
fought for

694
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:21,280
well before the great smog of 1952

695
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,679
there was the great stink of 1858 the

696
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,600
great stink happened when hot

697
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,120
weather brought out the smell of human

698
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,959
and industrial waste present on the

699
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,399
banks of the river ten

700
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,520
this waste was also linked to the

701
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,520
transmission of cholera

702
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,559
it's here we see a great example of

703
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,919
environmental action through satire

704
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,678
with many cartoons of the day

705
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,240
highlighting the unacceptable state of

706
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,799
things

707
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,320
and mocking government in action the

708
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,400
silent highwaymen

709
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,000
death rose on the ten claiming the lives

710
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,799
of victims who have not paid to have the

711
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,799
river cleaned up

712
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,000
the monster soup commonly called tim's

713
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,000
water

714
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,080

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,320
with art thou but one vast gutter one

tremendous common shore

722
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,559
london's first major cholera epidemic

723
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:24,879
struck in 1831

724
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:27,678
and claimed 6536 victims

725
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,640
in 1848 to 49 there was a second

726
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,400
outbreak

727
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:35,120
and 14 137 londoners died

728
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,400
this was followed by a third one in 1853

729
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,439
to 54

730
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,440
in which 10 738 people died

731
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,678
following the great stink of london

732
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,600
government authorities accepted a

733
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,520
proposal for an integrated and fully

734
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,320
functioning sewer system from the civil

735
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,400
engineer

736
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,240
joseph bezelget this marked the

737
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:59,520
beginning of london's sewage reform

738
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,279
during the 1970s and 80s the ozone hole

739
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,120
was identified by scientists

740
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,760
which was linked to the increase in skin

741
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,918
cancer the hole was caused by the use of

742
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,600
manufactured chemicals

743
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,520
an international treaty to phase out a

744
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,360
number of these chemicals the material

745
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,480
protocol on substances that deplete the

746
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,719
ozone layer

747
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,919
was agreed to on the 20 the 26th of

748
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,960
august 18

749
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:23,360
1987 and entered into force exactly two

750
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,960
years later

751
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,559
with the parties to the protocol having

752
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,159
phased out ninety percent

753
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,840
and eight ninety 98 of their ozone

754
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,919
depleting substances

755
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,158
they saved an estimated 2 million people

756
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,799
from skin cancer every year

757
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,320
why was the protocol so successful it

758
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,840
speculated it's because much of the

759
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,120
negotiation was held in small informal

760
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,678
groups and this enabled a genuine

761
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,678
exchange of views and created trust

762
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,880
the people negotiating the treaty also

763
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,000
included scientists

764
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,360
which like credibility

765
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,440
we must also note that the

766
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,279
ozone-damaging chemical industry

767
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,480
didn't have the lobbying power fossil

768
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,480
fuel companies have today

769
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,480
while governments declared climate

770
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,678
emergencies and merely philosophized

771
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,520
about what an

772
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,880
actual emergency response to climate

773
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,720
change could look like

774
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,480
the chronovirus pandemic propelled

775
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,080
countries globally into economic

776
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,480
political and social measures

777
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,840
including shutting down the economy that

778
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,240
is closing shops cafes restaurants etc

779
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,000
as well as borders these measures could

780
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,400
certainly be described as anything but

781
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,760
business as usual and as reflecting an

782
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,320
emergency taking

783
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,520
taken seriously while these responses

784
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,678
have been imperfect

785
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,440
and there is much to criticize it's

786
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,279
worth wondering why this pandemic has

787
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,559
mobilized action in a way climate change

788
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,720
hasn't

789
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,879
as we explored earlier some reasons are

790
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,960
that climate change is relatively

791
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,279
slower to show its impacts and it's

792
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,159
larger in scope and therefore requires a

793
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,919
multi-solutions approach

794
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,559
and this represents a heavier cognitive

795
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,679
load i.e it's not solved by silver

796
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,960
bullet

797
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,799
um technology like the vaccine

798
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,000
plus years of corporate lobbying has

799
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,440
spread disinformation

800
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,640
and slowed action moreover coronavirus

801
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,080
feels personal

802
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,080
that's because it spread person to

803
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,760
person and invades the body

804
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,360
could a greater narrative emphasis on

805
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,520
the body such as the presence of

806
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,879
microplastics in our digestive tracts or

807
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,399
pollution in our lungs

808
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,720
spur more climate action images of

809
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,639
nurses with mass creased faces

810
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,240
red and bleeding skin have invaded our

811
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,039
social networks accompanied by the

812
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,520
hashtag

813
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,320
stay home this invokes wartime

814
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,480
propaganda

815
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,480
asking people to do their part in

816
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,320
glorifying sacrifice

817
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,320
we will see the same messaging if the

818
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,559
climate crisis worsens

819
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,840
it's essential we counter these messages

820
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,960
that distract from government

821
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,559
accountability

822
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,600
and position avoidable which positions

823
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,279
avoidable suffering as acceptable

824
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,959
key to this is creating alliances

825
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,679
between essential workers medical

826
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,320
professionals

827
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,880
educators grocery store clerics etc and

828
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,879
activists

829
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,760
both coven 19 and climate change feature

830
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,480
famous exponential growth charts

831
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,760
yet we know this cannot be as was the

832
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,679
case with the spanish flu

833
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,000
flu curves are necessarily flattened if

834
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,919
the virus spreads through the population

835
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,159
infecting and killing people with until

836
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,320
herd immunity is achieved

837
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,000
climate change and its knock-on effects

838
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,760
also have the potential to kill off

839
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,520
populations to such an extent that

840
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,279
exceeding planetary boundaries

841
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,360
through consumption habits no longer

842
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,440
occurs

843
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,120
over the years the eco-fascist idea that

844
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,720
civilization is fundamentally in

845
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,039
conflict with the environment

846
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,039
and malthusianism which advocates for

847
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,480
population control as a means to avert

848
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,120
resource and security

849
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,080
have seeped into the public imagination

850
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,239
in addition to this

851
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,158
despair resignation and fatalism

852
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,960
stemming from eco anxiety have made

853
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,159
climate collapse

854
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,679
accepted as possible if not probable

855
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,000
the coronavirus on the other hand

856
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,840
carries no such baggage

857
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,919
however we again see how these large

858
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,600
narratives of courage collectivism and

859
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,399
action can be countered with defense

860
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,678
mechanism

861
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,600
and in individualism and inaction

862
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,279
anti-vaxxer conspiracy theorists are

863
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,199
coming out hard against the development

864
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,360
of a coronavirus vaccine

865
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,760
linking it to all of all things 5g

866
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,080
communications networks

867
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,520
in the u.s the epicenter of the nc

868
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,399
vaccination movement

869
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,158
is the children's health defense chd has

870
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,320
spread the rumor that the kovid 19

871
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,240
lockdown is being used opportunistically

872
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,520
for the installation of

873
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,200
5g masks it also ran a piece suggesting

874
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,520
that the dynamic provides cover for a

875
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,520
sinister quote global agenda

876
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,679
trying to make us all quote subjects of

877
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,760
a techno communist global movement

878
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,200
a science rhetoric of the major eco

879
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:45,919
fascist figure ted

880
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,919
isensi also known as the universe

881
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,480
as leading health experts have affirmed

882
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,879
the climate crisis

883
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,640
is a threat multiplier particularly for

884
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,840
communities suffering from environmental

885
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,919
injustice

886
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,799
and climate change isn't a future risk

887
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:07,039
the impacts are ukraine now

888
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,240
with a growing aging population and no

889
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,840
climate action

890
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,679
these impacts will get considerably

891
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,279
worse for example

892
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,200
heat related deaths in the uk are

893
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,039
projected to increase by about two and a

894
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,120
half times over

895
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:22,640
to over seven thousand by the 2050s

896
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,719
the barriers to addressing the public

897
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,600
health crisis that is climate change

898
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,760
are primarily socio-political rather

899
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,520
than economic or technical

900
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,879
crucially the sooner mitigative

901
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,879
strategies are implemented

902
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,159
the sooner nations can avoid massive

903
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,279
costs in health care

904
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,279
and emergency relief

905
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,279
some prosperity narratives focus on how

906
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,399
climate action can raise resource

907
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,080
efficiency

908
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,080
and stimulate innovation and new

909
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:54,399
investment in infrastructure to improve

910
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:56,480
the economy however as we've explored

911
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,678
our current economic system which aims

912
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,480
for infinite growth

913
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,480
is a major driver of climate change it's

914
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,600
therefore necessary we reconceptualize

915
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,480
prosperity

916
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,480
prosperity not as an ever-increasing gdp

917
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,120
but as financial sustainability and

918
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,440
meeting not exceeding one's needs

919
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,279
importantly this will involve narratives

920
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,960
that challenge consumerism

921
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,799
and the myth of green growth and

922
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,559
relatedly the concept of

923
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:23,600
decoupling relative decoupling refers to

924
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,600
a decline in the

925
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,360
ecological intensity per unit of

926
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,360
economic output

927
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,760
in this situation resource impacts

928
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,080
decline relative to the gdp

929
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,120
which could itself still be rising in

930
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,120
other words

931
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,199
total material throughput and emissions

932
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,959
continue to rise

933
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,880
absolute decoupling refers to a

934
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,880
situation in which resource impacts

935
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,279
decline in absolute terms

936
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,240
sufficient absolute decoupling remains

937
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,840
unproven

938
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,519
and when we're running out of time we

939
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,439
can't afford to make decisions based on

940
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,960
wishful thinking

941
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,960
um we know it works now

942
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,760
prosperity doesn't only have to have

943
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,760
material associations

944
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,440
it can refer to experiences that help us

945
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,600
thrive physically intellectually

946
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,840
emotionally and spiritually

947
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,760
walking through a forest access to a

948
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,000
community of people we care about

949
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,879
exercise and growing a garden are all

950
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,360
experiences with low planetary impact

951
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,159
we can even co-opt economic language for

952
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,120
our purposes

953
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,120
and refer to for example leading an

954
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,120
enriched life

955
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,439
as a sustainable lifestyle

956
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,360
growthism is anti-intellectual in the

957
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,039
sense that it prevents from

958
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,559
prevents us from thinking about what we

959
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,480
actually want the economy and our

960
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,440
society to achieve

961
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,480
gdp comes in to stand for thought itself

jason hickle

963
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,440
economic anthropologist one

964
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,399
environmental movement that focuses on

965
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,399
reimagining prosperity is de-growth

966
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,239
degrowth emphasizes the need to reduce

967
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,799
production and consumption in the global

968
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,720
north

969
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,158
and advocates for a socially just and

970
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,559
sustainable society

971
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,799
with well-being as an indicator of

972
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,200
prosperity instead of gdp

973
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,399
well-being can include for example life

974
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,840
expectancy

975
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,959
and self-reported life satisfaction and

976
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,840
happiness

977
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,840
the movement relies heavily on economic

978
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,480
data to support its claims

979
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,120
for example indicators of well-being are

980
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,519
higher

981
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,439
the more equitable society is in other

982
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,000
words people are happier in societies

983
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,279
where wealth

984
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,080
disparity is small what we find as well

985
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,880
being isn't

986
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,678
exclusively coupled with gdp growth not

987
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,760
to mention

988
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,080
climate change as it's linked to gdp

989
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:39,039
growth would certainly negatively impact

990
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,600
people's well-being

991
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,640
the real power of gdp growth as a metric

992
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,080
and narrative

993
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,000
is that it's just enough to convince

994
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,600
people that the system is working

995
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,440
who would otherwise be quite aware that

996
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,080
it's not

997
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,200
28 of all new income from global gdp

998
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,120
growth over the past

999
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,799
40 years have gone to the richest one

1000
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,199
percent all male and

1001
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,799
all millionaires in other words nearly

1002
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,440
one third of our labor resource

1003
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,440
extraction

1004
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:07,519
and co2 emissions have been done to make

1005
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,200
rich people richer

1006
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,199
hickle also makes the point that in

1007
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,279
psychology the capacity for

1008
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,879
self-restraint in the face of excess is

1009
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,720
considered to be a mark of maturity

1010
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,719
empathy and wisdom

1011
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,000
and yet applying this principle to

1012
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,638
consumption is considered

1013
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,079
unthinkable these sea growth narratives

1014
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,720
both challenge the economic growth

1015
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,480
paradigm

1016
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:30,319
and offer a new vision of prosperity

1017
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,320
that centers humans and the environment

1018
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,760
intergenerational responsibility public

1019
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,359
health and prosperity narratives can be

1020
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,440
combined to create a holistic approach

1021
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,359
to climate storytelling

1022
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,839
since each of these topics benefit from

1023
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,520
climate change mitigation and adaptation

1024
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,239
communications professionals can lead

1025
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,359
with the climate or with a co-benefit

1026
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,359
here are some examples

1027
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,520
we have a responsibility to solve

1028
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,598
climate change to make sure everyone

1029
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,839
especially our children can lead healthy

1030
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,079
and prosperous lives

1031
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:04,240
we can reduce death illness and the

1032
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,240
financial costs from climate change

1033
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,479
if we prioritize our children public

1034
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,598
health and prosperity

1035
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,040
ideally over time climate action and its

1036
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,200
co-benefits merge so

1037
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,839
so thoroughly that they become one and

1038
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,839
the same

1039
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,640
narrative economics is a book by robert

1040
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,920
schiller that references many historical

1041
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,680
moments of crisis

1042
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,040
and related transformative narratives

1043
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,000
which either contributed to

1044
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,599
or helped mitigate those crises might

1045
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,440
some of these kinds of narratives be

1046
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,440
applied to climate change

1047
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,200
for example the price increase of

1048
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,599
commodities between the end of world war

1049
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,078
1

1050
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,880
and 1920 was widely blamed on business

1051
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,400
people who were

1052
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,560
labeled with the word profiteer

1053
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,079
could the narrative figure profiteer be

1054
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,078
applied to big corporates and

1055
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,680
governments who benefit off the backs of

1056
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,599
the environment public health and our

1057
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,359
children's futures

1058
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,400
we have seen a taste of this with the

1059
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,078
popular 100 companies are responsible

1060
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,960
for

1061
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,960
71 percent of emissions talking point

1062
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,839
however this failed to mobilize adequate

1063
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,920
action

1064
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:10,480
the reason perhaps is these companies

1065
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,240
largely provide energy to consumers

1066
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,520
keeping their homes warm and their car

1067
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,040
tanks full

1068
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,960
so people couldn't wholly distance

1069
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,680
themselves from culpability and assume

1070
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,240
immoral

1071
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,240
high ground

1072
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,799
again we encounter the power of trusted

1073
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,720
messengers

1074
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,560
was schiller advocating for politicians

1075
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,799
and policy makers to take a more active

1076
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,119
role in narrative engineering

1077
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,680
such as dispelling misinformation and

1078
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,680
fostering desired economic behavior

1079
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,440
of course this would only be relevant to

1080
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,440
governments that support climate action

1081
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,760
christopher booker argues there are only

1082
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,560
a few basic storylines

1083
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,560
overcoming the monster rags to riches

1084
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,440
the quest voyage in return

1085
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,279
and comedy tragedy and rebirth at the

1086
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,119
core of these examples are stories of

1087
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,320
various kinds of transformation through

1088
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:04,640
confrontation

1089
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,640
social economic spatial and personal

1090
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,040
conflicting the climate issue into these

1091
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,079
familiar plots helped connect it to

1092
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,400
people

1093
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,680
could the monster we need to overcome

1094
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,079
the climate change

1095
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,319
or perhaps corrupt elites like fossil

1096
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:22,320
fuel ceos including governments

1097
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,920
who have profited at our expense

1098
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,119
how might we tell the rags to riches

1099
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,960
story that rejects our current

1100
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,880
conception of prosperity

1101
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,480
one in which we become truly prosperous

1102
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,079
as healthy individuals living in

1103
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,000
accordance with the environment

1104
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,599
and satisfied with our needs simply

1105
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
being met

1106
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,000
how about a homecoming story we build a

1107
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,480
closer relationship to the environment

1108
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,040
and in this way returning to ourselves

1109
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,560
as part of it

1110
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,079
there are a few aesthetic and literary

1111
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,200
movements associated with positive

1112
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,160
climate action

1113
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,960
like afrofuturism another that's gaining

1114
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,399
popularity

1115
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,599
is the topic of today which is solar

1116
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,200
punk

1117
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,960
solar punk creators imagine what a

1118
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,520
sustainable world could look like

1119
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,760
and how we can get there solar pump

1120
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,079
typically features art nouveau motifs

1121
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,880
heavily green cityscapes diversity and

1122
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,280
community

1123
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,119
and of course solar and wind power but

1124
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,640
solar punk is still quite niche

1125
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,480
there's much work that needs to be done

1126
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,160
here

1127
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,000
we've just thoroughly explored climate

1128
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,240
change communications

1129
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,320
its history the status quo and potential

1130
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,919
experiments and storytelling

1131
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,280
we learned that our ever evolving

1132
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,520
understanding of climate science should

1133
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,200
be at the core of our communications

1134
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,200
and that a good faith one-on-one

1135
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,720
conversation is the most resilient but

1136
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,240
small-scale form of engagement on

1137
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,000
climate change

1138
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,000
and narratives relating to

1139
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,320
intergenerational responsibility

1140
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,200
public health and a reimagined concept

1141
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,160
of prosperity

1142
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,560
are particularly effective and inspiring

1143
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,399
large audiences towards action

1144
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,839
yet are less resilient and especially

1145
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,839
vulnerable to being co-opted

1146
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,920
these micro and macro climate

1147
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,598
communications work together

1148
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,079
offering an entry point for lasting

1149
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,240
change a deeper confrontation with

1150
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,119
and transformation of our relationship

1151
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,319
to the environment

1152
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,800
each other and ourselves informed by

1153
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,160
climate science and ecology what's

1154
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,320
common to all these narratives

1155
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,399
is a different way of being in the world

1156
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,400
a rejection of the dominant hobbies and

1157
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,480
idea that humankind is fundamentally

1158
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,480
insecure and adversarial

1159
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,119
the truth is we have the capacity for

1160
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,359
both selfishness and generosity

1161
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,040
and we can make choices about how to be

1162
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,799
and what will enable us to collectively

1163
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,640
survive

1164
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,720
indeed climate change may be the worst

1165
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,680
story ever but it's not a terribly new

1166
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,759
one

1167
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,200
the first human adaptation known to us

1168
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,359
as foraging

1169
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,118
as tribes realize the importance of food

1170
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,720
security and strength in numbers for

1171
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,240
their survival

1172
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,000
they developed stories to reinforce

1173
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,839
supporting behaviors

1174
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,520
these stories warn of anti-social

1175
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,920
behaviors like deception

1176
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,160
stinginess and theft which could put

1177
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,680
groups at risk of food stress

1178
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,359
this is famously embodied in the

1179
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,160
mythological trickster figures

1180
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,160
sound familiar

1181
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,319
as we take a closer look at the

1182
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,440
environment its interdependencies

1183
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:12,160
tensions temporalities processes etc

1184
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,760
may become familiar to us but nature

1185
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,520
isn't a self-regulating system

1186
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,079
and there's much we cannot perceive or

1187
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,839
measure once we let go of the idea that

1188
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,839
the environment is totally balanced

1189
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,440
calculable and controllable and that

1190
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,799
humans must infinitely dominate

1191
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,040
whatever's around them

1192
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,040
we can begin to understand nature as a

1193
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,640
humble approximation

1194
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,040
we can slow down and think beyond

1195
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,960
ourselves only then can we truly

1196
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,520
integrate sustainable behaviors into our

1197
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,760
lives becoming better stewards

1198
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,400
collaborators and observers of the many

1199
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,839
people and organisms we encounter

1200
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,400
we will have written a story worth

1201
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,400
living for

1202
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,759

doing outreach that is an organization

1214
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:25,279
called climate outreach

1215
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:31,280
so yeah c-i-l-s-o-i-m-a-t-e

1216
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:34,960

1217
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,640
cool yeah on twitter but their website's

1218
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,400
really excellent and it's full of tons

1219
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,759
of case studies and reports

1220
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,640
um a lot of good stuff there awesome

1221
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,359
and then there's another one saying oh

1222
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,279
yeah

1223
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,480
first the funny one what comic book are

1224
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,000
the pictures from

1225
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,560
i'm also curious about it oh these are

1226
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,760
from multiple different comic books but

1227
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,960
they're all the work

1228
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,400
of um an artist called modlius

1229
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:03,200
um who's also jean gerhardt i believe

1230
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,119
his his full name his real name um yeah

1231
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,799
and he's a really excellent artist that

1232
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:12,000
um does a lot of

1233
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,920
um work that really i feel

1234
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,200
fits the solar panel aesthetic because

1235
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,359
there's a lot of very

1236
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,200
um you know there's a lot of pastel

1237
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,520
colors there's a lot of

1238
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,118
images of community and like nature

1239
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,920
focused imagery as well

1240
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,319
um yeah and this was like the individual

1241
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,359
um

1242
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,960
recruited by eurodossies for dune who

1243
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,799
did all the storyboarding i was hoping

1244
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,359
you were going to mention that

1245
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,400
yeah he has a really great um like

1246
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:39,040
profile inside

1247
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,079
definitely check him out he's in the

1248
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,319
part of the bondy

1249
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:47,839
movement yeah then in your experience

1250
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:49,759
when trying to convince politicians um

1251
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,599
what is the most effective approach to

1252
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,720
make them understand that climate change

1253
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:57,040
needs to be fought yeah

1254
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,078
it really um it really depends on the

1255
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,440
politician

1256
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:04,079
um so yeah

1257
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,560
um but ultimately like like more

1258
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,480
generally

1259
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,680
what you know of course like politicians

1260
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,680
are motivated by

1261
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,960
retaining retaining their job and

1262
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,078
staying relevant right

1263
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,000
um so a lot of it is actually i think

1264
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,880
like things like citizen lobbying can be

1265
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,839
really powerful

1266
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,760
um and just ensuring that like you know

1267
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:27,440
showing up that your voice is heard

1268
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,599
um and that um that this is

1269
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,440
this is the direction a city wants to go

1270
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,319
in um

1271
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,680
and you know also creating things like

1272
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,520
citizen assembly

1273
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,879
um this could be a really powerful thing

1274
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,119
but yeah basically like

1275
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,720
really heavily communicating that this

1276
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,760
is an action that everyone in the city

1277
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,040
wants to take

1278
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,960
it benefits people in the city um

1279
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,480
and i think it helps for politicians to

1280
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,079
have like

1281
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,000
really tangible um actions

1282
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,440
you know like so if you're if you're a

1283
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,800
lobbying group it's really helpful to

1284
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,839
have like a specific

1285
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,599
goal and that goal might be like getting

1286
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,279
the government to divest from fossil

1287
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,000
fuels or getting

1288
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,400
even just like pensions like here in um

1289
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,839
in

1290
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,520
in germany there's a great group called

1291
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,759
fossil free berlin

1292
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,200
that their specific mandate for the for

1293
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,560
last year i believe was

1294
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,319
to try to um lobby the government to

1295
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,119
ensure that no fossil fuels were in like

1296
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:24,560
government pensions um so

1297
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,000
i think these specific goals can be

1298
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,359
really helpful but yeah definitely

1299
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,599
politicians is a tough one

1300
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:31,520
and i think that's where citizen

1301
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,000
engagement can be really powerful

1302
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,440
um like working within government or

1303
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,640
alongside government

1304
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:41,920
um yeah i mean it's a lot of

1305
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:43,839
i think also offering a compelling

1306
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,079
roadmap like something really tangible a

1307
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:48,319
plan helps them because i think

1308
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,839
a lot of times these individuals you

1309
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,720
know especially at national governments

1310
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,560
like they signed

1311
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,160
the paris agreement and then they have

1312
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,440
to take care of like literally every

1313
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,520
other topic

1314
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,880
um so it's what's helpful about an

1315
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,560
organization like mine or other

1316
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,400
organizations too is that

1317
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,480
you can connect governments with the

1318
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,319
different policy innovations

1319
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,280
technologies etc that are out there to

1320
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,119
get them like

1321
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,560
up to speed on on what's changing but

1322
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,240
yeah it really depends on the government

1323
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:15,040
obviously there's some

1324
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,319
very conservative governments um it also

1325
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,279
depends on

1326
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:21,200
the country and what their current like

1327
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,280
economic reality is you know like

1328
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,960
countries like poland even germany

1329
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,079
there's there's like some heavy industry

1330
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,480
countries

1331
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,839
that are going to need a lot more like

1332
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,280
hand holding through the

1333
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:36,078
process because they have um and like

1334
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,079
heavy industry workers to take care of

1335
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,400
so we call that the just transition

1336
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,800
um angle which is just to ensure that

1337
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,319
these individuals

1338
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,560
aren't left behind and that their jobs

1339
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:49,680
can be transitioned to renewables

1340
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:53,279
for example and basically like

1341
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,240
um yeah like to avoid civil backlash as

1342
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,160
well you know because

1343
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,759
we might be sold on solar pump we might

1344
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,598
be sold on climate change mitigation

1345
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,240
adaptation but there's a lot of actual

1346
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,040
citizens

1347
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,160
who's who feel you know their their

1348
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,200
livelihoods threatened

1349
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,799
um by the green transition and that's

1350
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,839
really valid um and they need to

1351
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,160
be heard as well so um yeah so just to

1352
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,839
say

1353
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,520
there's not like a cl unfortunately not

1354
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:17,680
a very easy way to answer the question

1355
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,079
but i hope that um at least like painted

1356
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,560
out a bit of a landscape

1357
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,839
yeah yeah those are tough ones yeah it's

1358
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,279
a tough

1359
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:28,720
rated point if i yeah christine uh so in

1360
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,440
the um

1361
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,399
trust discord we have a reading group

1362
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,480
that goes through

1363
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,760
various um topics and we've discussed

1364
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,319
the climate

1365
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,920
in the climate channel uh most recently

1366
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:42,880
we discussed an article

1367
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,760
about the so the impossibility of

1368
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,160
building

1369
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,200
coherent narratives around this kind of

1370
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,560
complex

1371
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,598
mess of intertangled um happenings and

1372
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,359
goings on that is

1373
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,960
climate change and obviously you're

1374
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,880
trying to address this by

1375
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,800
um you know weaving these these

1376
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,200
narratives in different ways

1377
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,680
um but this um uh article we were

1378
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:06,160
reading suggested this is like a

1379
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,598
fruitless or a hopeless endeavor so it's

1380
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,879
really interesting to hear about some of

1381
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,960
your

1382
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,400
lived experiences and your challenges in

1383
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,560
uh bringing these

1384
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,079
uh uh new narratives and new ways of

1385
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,400
telling the stories like

1386
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,520
uh have you had uh notable successes

1387
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,200
have been times when

1388
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,160
um these approaches have fallen short

1389
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,359
you're really interested to hear your

1390
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:27,920
experiences

1391
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:29,440
yeah i mean i just think overall um

1392
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,119
i mean i think that the point of entry

1393
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,200
is dialogue right like

1394
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,559
this is this is how we shift the overton

1395
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,078
of like on the what's

1396
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,720
in the realm of acceptable public

1397
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:41,359
discourse so talking about it

1398
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,240
um is really the first step and i think

1399
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,799
that

1400
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,160
that's like undeniably valuable you know

1401
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,680
like we've seen the change we've seen

1402
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,680
the change from

1403
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,680
from just the last few years and that

1404
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,000
can be accounted that can be credited a

1405
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,598
little

1406
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,119
bit um due to the felt the increasing

1407
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,640
felt effects of climate change but i

1408
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,359
really think there's

1409
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,558
a huge um movement happening now which

1410
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,839
you see with

1411
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,160
fridays for future and extinction

1412
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,680
rebellion and a lot more people

1413
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,160
are talking and thinking about climate

1414
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,960
change um when they haven't before

1415
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,680
um so that that's like very tangible

1416
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,200
clear change

1417
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,879
and there's more like i mentioned in the

1418
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,200
talk there's more um

1419
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,480
in certain areas like uh green parties

1420
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,879
being elected

1421
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,000
um so i'm like i try to remain somewhat

1422
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,400
optimistic about it

1423
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,280
um but yeah as far as these like

1424
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:32,640
applicable narratives yeah i mean it's

1425
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,079
i think um climate outreach uh has a lot

1426
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,279
of data on

1427
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,040
their work because it's probably a

1428
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,480
better reference than my organization

1429
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,319
because they deal exclusively with

1430
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,319
climate change communications so

1431
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:44,000
i think what they have is probably more

1432
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,759
like relevant to people listening to the

1433
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,359
talk and interested in like

1434
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,960
seeing those reports on how like public

1435
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,640
perception is changing so i definitely

1436
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,520
invite you all to see to visit climate

1437
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,078
outreach

1438
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,599
um they do great stuff but um yeah i

1439
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,559
would i would argue against that i mean

1440
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,960
i just think

1441
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,559
yeah of course it's like a really big

1442
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,800
daunting problem

1443
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,319
um but i guess yeah i get that's a bit

1444
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,200
explored in the talk like obviously you

1445
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,400
need to have

1446
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,359
different narratives for different

1447
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,680
places but yet um

1448
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,880
i think they're like what can tie all

1449
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,078
these things together

1450
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:19,119
like are these big narratives with mass

1451
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,559
resonance like public health you know

1452
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,920
intergenerational responsibility

1453
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,599
prosperity those are things that matter

1454
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,800
to literally everyone like

1455
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,440
across like physical borders cultural

1456
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,200
boundaries

1457
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:34,319
um so i would say those are good

1458
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:36,240
good entry points for um

1459
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,680
yeah for any storytelling you're doing

1460
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:41,520
you know like

1461
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:43,520
um but also yeah if you're if you're

1462
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,040
depends the context also like because

1463
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,240
you mentioned climate storytelling but

1464
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,079
it's like

1465
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,520
is that a microscope microscope are you

1466
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,079
talking about like literature

1467
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,599
like creative work or climate reporting

1468
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,960
you know what i mean like there's

1469
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:58,720
it's gonna be different um but i think

1470
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,000
i think it's i think to say like oh

1471
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,558
because it's it's

1472
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,079
needs to be targeted like then it's an

1473
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,880
impossible task or something i think

1474
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,760
that's wrong

1475
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,559
um i just think we need to work harder

1476
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,240
that's all

1477
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:11,599
and we need more people on board like i

1478
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,799
mentioned in the in the beginning of the

1479
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,400
talk it's

1480
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,839
it was like kind of an impoverished

1481
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,000
movement for a long time it was a lot of

1482
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,799
like yeah like citizens engaged and then

1483
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,280
also like

1484
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,880
climate scientists but then there's huge

1485
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,480
there are huge gaps in skill sets like

1486
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,599
that's why it's interesting to see solar

1487
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,839
punk

1488
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,839
capture you know not necessarily capture

1489
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:32,400
the public's imagination but some

1490
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:34,400
subcultures imagination um i think

1491
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,119
that's that's what needs to happen like

1492
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,559
the movement just didn't have didn't

1493
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,559
have climate communicators for a long

1494
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,119
time didn't have artists on board didn't

1495
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,880
have

1496
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,520
you know developers like all these

1497
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:48,400
different skill sets um it's like really

1498
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:50,559
quite recent that people are pushing

1499
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:54,880
into the green sector and saying like

1500
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:58,480
actually you know i want to work um

1501
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,920
work on this topic uh so i think it's so

1502
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,680
new in a way like

1503
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,040
no we're definitely gonna see change

1504
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,720
yeah maybe um

1505
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,880
there's this mix between like this

1506
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,240
top-down institutional driven stuff

1507
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,319
coming from a policy side like where

1508
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,078
you're working christine eit and so on

1509
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:13,759
and soda punk has this more kind of

1510
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:16,800
grassroots emergent

1511
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,800
um movement

1512
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,079
imagine yeah i think we're getting some

1513
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,160
people that want i'm looking at the chat

1514
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:28,400
um i don't want to like you're too long

1515
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,960
no no we take the time we want it's our

1516
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,920
channel

1517
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,480
okay if people want to see other talks

1518
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,760
they should

1519
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,440
go somewhere i think the next guy is

1520
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:39,680
kind of a loser anyway

1521
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,319
[Music]

1522
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,040
um yeah let's be excellent to each other

1523
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:45,680
um

1524
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,800
thank you christine yeah thank you yeah

1525
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,799
it's really nice

1526
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,200
and also very aesthetically pleasing i

1527
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,240
would say like

1528
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:57,359
so before we move to the next talk

1529
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,919
uh with our live guest here live remote

1530
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:01,040
guest

1531
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:03,839

1532
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,880
if that's your really your house on

1533
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:08,160
twitter

1534
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,599
or it's uh or it's not kristin can you

1535
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:13,440
answer that

1536
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:15,280
um behind me i think it's this way

1537
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,119
it might be directed towards someone

1538
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,960
else but like

1539
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,400
you possibly have a different background

1540
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,760
we haven't had a different background

1541
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,760
for a while

1542
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,280
this is without class analysis and

1543
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,880
support by the proletarian masses

1544
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,070
climate communicators

1545
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,440
is just liberal instagram influencing um

1546
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:33,040
[Music]

1547
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,640
let me see oh without classmate and

1548
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,680
support by it yeah i mean

1549
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:39,598
i i like to believe that like my um

1550
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,960
in the talk it was you know i talked

1551
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:45,280
about this intersectional

1552
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,880
approach like um yeah i mean i think

1553
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,640
we were talking a bit earlier about what

1554
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,040
is cyberpunk what is slurpunk or what is

1555
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:52,720
punk i think punk is actually

1556
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,480
really centered around like class

1557
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,040
struggle um for one thing but i think

1558
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,280
what's

1559
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,079
what's great about solarpunk is it goes

1560
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,040
beyond that and

1561
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,839
it's quite feminist it's quite um

1562
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,680
focused on

1563
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:05,520
like racial like ethnic diversity as

1564
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,799
well which i think is really important

1565
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,079
for the movement

1566
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,359
and um obviously yeah like the current

1567
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:15,920
economic system

1568
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:17,680
is incredibly harmful towards

1569
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,280
individuals you know like as explored in

1570
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,839
the deeper section um

1571
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:24,000
but also for the planet and um

1572
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:26,960
externalities are

1573
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,319
like inherently like to to like change

1574
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,079
the financial system and include

1575
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,440
externalities that's absolutely like a

1576
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:33,920
decolonial

1577
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,760
feminist struggle um so let's be clear

1578
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,119
about that

1579
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,960
climate communicators to do their work

1580
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:43,200
effectively absolutely need to anchor

1581
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,280
their their work in in these realities

1582
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,879
um and i think there's some really

1583
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,359
amazing people doing this there's a
