22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,199
presentation

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,719

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,239
javier it's nice to meet you

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,960
um so my name is lujan and i'm based in

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,000
potsdam which is close to berlin

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,320
and i'm a free candidate for the next

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,400
federal elections

29
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,919
which are happening next year in

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,520
september

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,159
so um i'm running without a party

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,280
my background is in extinction rebellion

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,799
and greenpeace

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,320
so but yeah i think uh due to

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,600
my year in the climate movement um

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,919
i'm really inspired to use um

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,960
this energy and bring it into the next

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,079
elections

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,960
um the stakes are really high in germany

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,360
i mean like everywhere if we don't uh

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,240
switch towards 1.5 degree limit in the

42
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,159
next

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,520
legislative period the ship has said

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,799
so it is my main mission to

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,759
bring this objective into federal

46
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,200
politics

47
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,439
because so far what we've seen in

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,439
germany is that

49
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,479
all our big parties they are not

50
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,960
committing to

51
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,160
hard objectives enough which are

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,840
sufficient

53
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,040
everyone is talking about climate

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,879
material neutrality in 2050 but

55
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:20,400
that's not enough as we all know so

56
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:24,000
um as a free candidate

57
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,440
i can i want to build

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,879
new coalitions in this electoral area

59
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,239
which has roughly 200 000 people

60
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,440
um i need 50 000 votes to

61
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,879
win the direct mandate and so that's a

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,760
like a quantitative challenge um but my

63
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,560
slogan

64
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,879
you can see uh left on the right side of

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,640
me

66
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:51,840
is called it means

67
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,440
more or less just do it or make it easy

68
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,160
like it's a word play um or a double

69
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,040
meaning

70
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,599
it means that i would like to offer

71
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,840
people

72
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,079
easy ways to engage with the classical

73
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,959
politics

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,519
especially people who are kind of turned

75
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,400
off

76
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,200
or disappointed by regular party

77
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,840
politics

78
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,879
who find it too hierarchical and too

79
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,080
patriarchical

80
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,959
and so on and the machine

81
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,920
the doing um i think is really important

82
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,680
and i learned this

83
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,518
uh during extinction rebate and i think

84
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,840
there are so many solutions and great

85
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,720
initiatives and grassroots

86
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,760
uh energy there um we just have to make

87
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,080
it bigger and

88
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,959
like scale it up and bring more energy

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,280
to it and

90
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,360
we don't have to reinvent the wheel so

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,920
the assumption is everything is there

92
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,280
we need to find out where the resources

93
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,599
and the community

94
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,440
bring it together and like create this

95
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,359
movement during the next year

96
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:54,480
and yeah to um kind of make a statement

97
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,480
but also win the election

98
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,159
yeah so over to you i would say except

99
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,879
if you have questions

100
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,679
you need for your background maybe um

101
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,679
then let me know

102
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,599
for delay i think jacob got frozen

103
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,559
yes javi please just go ahead and great

104
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,360

intro luanne

106
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,000
after this great and inspiring intro i

107
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,040

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,040
which is what i

111
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,080
am explaining afterwards and my

112
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,160
background is

113
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:49,758
basically like um grassroots movements

114
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,560
squats my framework is the the battista

115
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,759
movement

116
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,160
world social forum anti-globalization

117
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,840
and a couple of years ago after being

118
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,800
involved in the housing movement

119
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,359
and evictions and all this stuff we

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,720
decided in barcelona together with

121
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,280
many other activists to to jump into

122
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,880
formal politics into official

123
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,479
politics and run for office and we won

124
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,800
and this is the crazy thing and

125
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,680
and now i'm working i was working a

126
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,520
couple of years

127
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,680
for for the organization that won the

128
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,680
elections for barcelona

129
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,720
and now i'm working for for the city of

130
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,120
amsterdam

131
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,160
trying to do something similar and to

132
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,919
creating some

133
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,919
municipalist movement in europe

134
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,520
that's super impressive if you've been

135
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,600
an inspiration

136
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,080
with barcelona income i also saw the

137
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,840
documentary about ada kulau and

138
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,840
like the whole thing it's like very

139
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,000
inspiring

140
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,520
so you want me to go on with the

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,759
presentation that i prefer

142
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,479
jack up or how you want to do it yes

143
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,479
please okay

144
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,159
um i'm gonna share the screen i prepared

145
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,960
some presentation to make it a bit more

146
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,639
because i don't

147
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,080
like like at least i'm very tired with

148
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,560
this

149
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:20,159
looking at faces all the time so

150
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:24,080
i did this um

151
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,080
i think like this okay

152
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,759
so first i'm gonna explain the the

153
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,160
framework in which we

154
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,039
or the context in which we decided to to

155
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,120
do something

156
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,280
this crazy because for us for people

157
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,960
like me who always hated

158
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:42,559
and still hate if i managed parties and

159
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,880
formal politics and it was a crazy leap

160
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,880
to do

161
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,360
2017 we already know this big economic

162
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,639
crisis

163
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,560
2009 in spain i think it was

164
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,680
pretty different in northern europe but

165
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,759
in southern europe

166
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,199
it started to be pretty crazy this

167
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,360
social crisis and with

168
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,560
social crisis i mean like crazy

169
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,000
evictions

170
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,720
and a lot of violence um perpetrated by

171
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,560
by the state by the institution some

172
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,759
people who killed themselves

173
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,199
when they were about to to be evicted

174
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,160
and we started to see something crazy

175
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,880
like

176
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,919
people who never got together who never

177
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,800
um

178
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,240
fight uh started to do it you know i

179
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,919
like this picture because it makes

180
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,199
people from different colors which is

181
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,639
something that it was

182
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:36,160
it never happened before in spain um

183
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,199
and in 2019 we had our

184
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,599
our occupy which was called 15m

185
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,680
and this was very important because this

186
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,800
change this open

187
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,639
the debate of whether what we had was an

188
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,360
actual democracy

189
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,400
and we had this like big mobilizations

190
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,479
and all this stuff

191
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,679
and this this created a shift

192
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,080
and then in 2014 we said hey like next

193
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,720
year

194
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,440
we have election local elections in in

195
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,120
barcelona and also national elections

196
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,360
so we thought maybe it's the right

197
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,039
moment to think about something like

198
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,960
this

199
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:17,759
we decided to launch this idea and

200
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,840
and we won the elections this we we

201
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,520
decided to run for office and we won as

202
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,960
i said earlier

203
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,680
uh just one picture to show this and the

204
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,039
night when

205
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,560
when we had the results and now i'm

206
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,559
going to explain a little bit

207
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,599
very quickly because i think it's more

208
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,159
about a

209
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,320
conversation but the process in which we

210
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:42,000
created barcelona and come on

211
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,680
um we launched the idea of like

212
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,320
okay we never thought about mixing

213
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,920
our energies and when i say our i mean

214
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,880
people from the street

215
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,000
social movements ngos with political

216
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,800
parties

217
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,560
uh but we thought that maybe that that

218
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,040
was the right time so we launched this

219
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,399
idea

220
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,519
why don't we create something new

221
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,920
that gathers all the energies uh we said

222
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,920
very explicitly we don't want to create

223
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,360
another lefty party

224
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,800
that sums to the infinite list

225
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,760
of uh leftist small parties

226
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,719
and so we want to gather all these all

227
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,519
these energies and

228
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,360
and we said do our are people interested

229
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,160
in this and we said if we collect

230
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,880
30 000 signatures then this was the

231
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,839
first step

232
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,720
if we collect 30 000 signatures in three

233
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,760
months

234
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,720
then we'll go on otherwise we'll be back

235
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,839
to our

236
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,800
housing environmentalists feminists

237
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,680
or whatever movements and we did we

238
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,519
collected them

239
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:52,000
so we said okay let's go

240
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,800
we invited all kind of parties to join

241
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,440
all kind of

242
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,079
um organizations and also all kind of

243
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,720
people

244
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,920
this was the key factor if we were able

245
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,720
to engage

246
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,199
people who were never in politics so

247
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,480
what

248
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,760
we did the first when once we decided to

249
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,959
go on was to to create this code of

250
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,600
ethics

251
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,119
which maybe in germany or in other

252
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,800
places is not that important

253
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,200
but in spain there was there is still is

254
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,000
a lot of corruption and this all these

255
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,240
things

256
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,440
so it was very important to say okay the

257
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,760
way we are doing

258
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,040
politics it's not only about the ideas

259
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,880
or the goals

260
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,319
but the way we are doing this is going

261
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,560
to be different

262
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,000
our agendas are going to be public we

263
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,518
are going to have a maximum

264
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,320
wage so there's some sort of things that

265
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,640
we're going to do

266
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,480
very differently so that we are not

267
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,880
working for the big lobbies big

268
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,320
corporations or the big powers

269
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,680
but we are working in a very

270
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,240
open source way with in the

271
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,800
hackers movement maybe it's a very

272
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,000
common

273
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:03,599
thing but definitely in the party

274
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,320
politics no at all so this was the first

275
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,800
thing that we did

276
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,000
the second thing was a participatory

277
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,199
program

278
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,200
um so we basically

279
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,640
created an online platform where

280
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,640
everyone was able to

281
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:24,399
you know to to promote to pro to

282
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,240
i don't find any words or to propose

283
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,440
an idea something to do in the city

284
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,920
could be something a big

285
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,600
idea or something very specific in your

286
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,439
neighborhood or whatever

287
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,279
and we did also some physical meetings

288
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,480
because there's people who are not very

289
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,000
used to

290
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,839
work on online and we put all that

291
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,920
information together

292
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,079
in this online platform and then we were

293
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,439
like putting together different ideas

294
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,560
like adding

295
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,920
and there was it's a long process

296
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,959
there's no time now to explain this

297
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,599
once we had the the program

298
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,319
so the what after the the how then we

299
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,360
have the

300
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,680
the what and then it's like

301
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,680
okay how we're gonna do this like

302
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,079
technically not logistically we need

303
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,120
money

304
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,880
we need some people working on this so

305
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,800
we were like also talking

306
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,600
like we don't want money for big

307
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,680
organizations we're gonna

308
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,880
make all public all our numbers and blah

309
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,120
blah

310
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,079
and and this is what we did we did it

311
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,279
next

312
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:32,479
uh oh sorry

313
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:35,040
yeah and and then

314
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,839
what what we did the last was there so i

315
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,120
had a problem

316
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:42,399
can you see properly the

317
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,519
yeah yes we can see yes

318
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,360
okay because they had something um

319
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,200
and the last thing and we did it in this

320
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,519
order because we thought

321
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,399
it was if we would have started thinking

322
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,760
who would

323
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,480
running because um then that would be

324
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,200
very difficult

325
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,200
we started with how we're gonna do it

326
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,240
and what we're gonna do it and then

327
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,399
who who is not the most important thing

328
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,600
and always create some tensions because

329
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,000
there's ego

330
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,360
there's people who really like to be in

331
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,800
some concrete positions

332
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:18,240
so this is the last thing we did and

333
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:23,120
and yeah so then we started the campaign

334
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,120
and it was very good because we won

335
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,760
i compiled here some ideas of what

336
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,480
i think were like key factors of the

337
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,439
success

338
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,560
but it's too long um maybe we can go

339
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,959
through this later

340
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,680
in the conversation but i would like to

341
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,638
focus on

342
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,959
three points that defines what

343
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,480
municipalism the approach because as i

344
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,880
said earlier

345
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,519
we had national elections and local

346
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,279
elections

347
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,760
and we had a long debate for three

348
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,880
months we were debating what to do

349
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,240
and we decided we finally to to

350
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,959
run for local elections

351
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,600
based on based to be honest also in

352
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:07,119
logistics and practical

353
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:10,880
reasons but um also

354
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,760
thinking that you know the state level

355
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,880
is much more difficult to get in there's

356
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,399
the big powers

357
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,160
are more powerful there and it's much

358
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,240
easier to gather people and to

359
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,000
understand each other and to talk about

360
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:30,079
concrete problems locally so

361
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,279
we we embraced this municipalist

362
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,239
strategy which we summarized in three

363
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,040
points

364
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,839
local focus so we are working locally

365
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,360
with people

366
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:45,519
with the neighborhoods which allows

367
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:48,320
much more normal people to get involved

368
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,519
then the idea of conference which is

369
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,800
pretty critical

370
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,320
at least in in spain it was we wouldn't

371
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,399
we wanted to put together

372
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,880
parties ngos social movements artists

373
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,639
and scholars and people from the

374
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,120
academies

375
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,680
people who are usually don't like each

376
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,399
other

377
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,519
or you sometimes hate each other like

378
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,880
let's put the

379
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:15,920
focus on the things that we want to do

380
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:19,279
and let's let ourselves

381
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:22,079
um yeah know each other and

382
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,800
collaborate with each other and then the

383
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,719
third point

384
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,560
which is very important is about the

385
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,680
network because

386
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,719
this idea of local um can be

387
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,599
interpreted in a very nationalist way

388
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,560
like it's about us and it's definitely

389
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,639
not about us

390
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,959
we are trying to solve global problems

391
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,839
we need the network when we did this in

392
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,199
barcelona

393
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,399
madrid coruna valencia many other

394
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,199
citizens painted

395
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,720
something similar and some of them also

396
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,920
won the elections

397
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,639
but much more than in spain this we are

398
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,639
talking about

399
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,480
solving problems that are like

400
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,030
historical

401
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,160
patriarchy exploitation

402
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:09,600
[Music]

403
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,839
growth all these things that are global

404
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,680
so when we focus on the local it's not

405
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,720
because we forget this

406
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,880
but because the way we create this

407
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,839
big power that we need to change these

408
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,959
things

409
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:26,320
is focus on the local but we keep the

410
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,800
global approach and then

411
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,680
very quickly i want to talk about two

412
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,040
projects that

413
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,439
we are working on one of them is the

414
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:39,680
european municipalist network

415
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:42,160
it's a project actually the name

416
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,000
we are not a network or we are creating

417
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,360
this network now

418
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,639
and it there's four activities that we

419
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,000
are doing we are mapping

420
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,160
local initiatives we are there is a

421
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,639
group of feminization of politics

422
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,719
thinking how to feminize the way we

423
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,680
treat each other the way we think and we

424
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,720
will collaborate

425
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,918
with the way we do politics

426
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,360
one another um

427
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:12,079
activity is dissemination so

428
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,799
communication but also writing in

429
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,000
general

430
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,439
about uh we are working with with people

431
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,599
from the academy

432
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:24,799
people from journalists and others

433
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:27,839
and then the municipal school which this

434
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,639
this event this talk could be included

435
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,240
in this like we

436
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,000
want to spread we want to to share

437
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,840
our experiences not from different

438
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,280
municipalist organizations

439
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,678
in europe so this one project

440
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,440
and this is going on everyone is invited

441
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,799
is a totally open

442
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:50,400
project and then the other one is

443
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:53,440
a forum that we are organizing in may

444
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,480
next year and

445
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,720
we we take a little bit the the soul of

446
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,360
the world social forum maybe some of you

447
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,370
know

448
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,559
from about it um

449
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,760
[Music]

450
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,559
but we want to do this in a

451
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,080
decentralized way so we want to take

452
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:12,639
most likely april and may two months for

453
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,199
as many cities town and villages in

454
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,720
europe

455
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:20,160
to organize a two three days conference

456
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,400
for thinking how is the city

457
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,520
or the village or the town of the future

458
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,799
that we want

459
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,918
so which which is the transition

460
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:32,480
that we need to start to walk through

461
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,120
and which is the division that we have

462
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,679
of the field of this future

463
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,959
and we want to do it as i you can see

464
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,880
here like without

465
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,360
owner you know in a very open source way

466
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,720
we want to you know frame it of course

467
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,559
with the covet

468
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,240
thing with the environmentalist

469
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,760
movements that rised up in the last

470
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,400
years

471
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,520
and and pretty focus on this idea of

472
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,919
transition

473
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,918
different transitions because it's

474
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,000
towards sustainability towards the

475
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,480
colonization the colonizing

476
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,520
towards feminization and towards the

477
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,799
digitalization

478
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,720
and maybe some others but

479
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,120
and one important thing and i think i

480
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,160
can finish with this

481
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,559
is the way we want to work

482
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,440
the we want to do politics in a

483
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,160
different way

484
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,880
so it's not about your personal ego but

485
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,640
also

486
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,280
your organizational ego because

487
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,360
sometimes like i want the brand of my

488
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,720
the logo of my organization to be in the

489
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,840
center but

490
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,960
okay let's put this away and let's

491
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,840
really some forces so

492
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,039
yeah everyone is invited to contact us

493
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,600
and to

494
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,039
to organize an event in their

495
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,159
municipality

496
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:51,200
to do this we'll also use the cd

497
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,760
which is an online platform in which

498
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,000
each of the groups will use it for

499
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,039
organizing their own event but also will

500
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,160
use it to federate the results of the

501
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,520
different events

502
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,080
the different local forums there's much

503
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,360
more to

504
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,840
explain but i don't want to make it

505
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,840
longer

506
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,919
this is a bit of a joke of course

507
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:20,879
but but since the

508
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,880
in in germany in leipzig this year and

509
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,360
you're thinking about this and

510
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,840
organizing this for posdan

511
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,678
i was making this joke but in general of

512
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,480
course i'm doing this because jakob

513
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,280
contacted me

514
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,600
and i i think this is what we have to do

515
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,080
spread and collaborate and everything

516
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,678
i'm a

517
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,320
very an internationalist but i'm also

518
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,880
doing

519
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,240
this collaborating with this because

520
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,760
because we need you

521
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,799
i know when i say you now i was

522
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,879
focusing a bit in northern europe i

523
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,559
think in southern europe there are

524
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,919
many things happening also because of

525
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,720
the crisis is more obvious

526
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,440
but the centrality and the energy that

527
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,360
you have

528
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,280
the the power let's use the right word

529
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,639
that you have if we if we would have in

530
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,240
leipzig boston

531
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,400
berlin or munich or amsterdam or

532
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,840
one of the big important cities in

533
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,080
northern europe

534
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,520
if we would have a major as we have in

535
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,480
barcelona

536
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,080
that said two weeks ago please citizens

537
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,720
of barcelona don't buy

538
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:37,760
in amazon it's killing our

539
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,880
street and our shopkeepers

540
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:44,240
is killing our economy and our

541
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:47,440
city if this would be said but the mayor

542
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,159
of berlin this would be like

543
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,000
you know the mayor of berlin has the

544
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,919
telephone of the mayor of new york

545
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,440
beijing or whoever whatever so yeah

546
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,919
it's also an invitation for you all to

547
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,960
to do this yeah and maybe i think i did

548
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,080
it a bit longer

549
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,360
sorry amazing storytelling uh

550
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,799
chevy and um do yen please

551
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,840
any questions this is your

552
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:19,039
your time yeah so

553
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,439
i wanna pick up your initiative harvey

554
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,840
and

555
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,280
maybe we can talk about you know just

556
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,039
play through

557
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,520
how would that look like a local

558
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,640
transition forum and potsdam

559
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,879
um yeah so

560
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,000
i think one big challenge which you

561
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,559
always have is like

562
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,360
okay you need a digital infrastructure

563
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,520
um

564
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,399
how to get people on there what kind of

565
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,960
infrastructure

566
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,520
is there how can people you know what

567
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,679
what do you

568
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,520
give them what what is existing what

569
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,159
kind of templates or guidelines or

570
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:55,679
other things resources do you provide

571
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:59,440
and what needs to come from the local

572
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:01,039
we are doing this in um for some people

573
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,320
this would be a weakness

574
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:07,679
for me this is a strength in an

575
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:10,639
extremely open way so we are

576
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,240
we we still don't have a governance for

577
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,520
this project

578
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,280
you know the more people join the more

579
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,360
you know okay let's take decisions

580
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,520
together and it's

581
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,879
it's the same with them with this idea

582
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,158
of the template of

583
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,840
how a local forum could look like we are

584
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,960
working on this it's an open

585
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,840
document we can share this with

586
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,960
with you or whoever would be interested

587
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,879
um

588
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:41,919
so the idea what we want is to

589
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,039
to we are actually asking people what

590
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,400
they need locally

591
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,960
we are in some cities that we know

592
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,000
more people we are trying to put people

593
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,240
together

594
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,240
like people what we think is that the

595
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,000
main and that's why i explained at the

596
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,240
beginning the context in which we

597
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,240
decided to do this in barcelona

598
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:07,520
because without them i don't find the

599
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,559
word without the broth

600
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,279
you can't do that no you you need you

601
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,879
need

602
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:18,000
a strong social

603
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,400
civil society if you don't have this

604
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,200
and this is where everything has to be

605
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,799
based on

606
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,600
so we are inviting people i i'm making

607
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,639
now this

608
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,600
this example with with budapest because

609
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,039
we have this school a couple of days ago

610
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,199
the people that we know from budapest

611
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,240
from different movements we made a call

612
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,240
with all of them say hey do you want all

613
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,039
together without any fight without

614
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,760
anything

615
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,840
we don't have to agree on on everything

616
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,080
but we have

617
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,559
we are the main

618
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,000
idea so let's organize something in

619
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,200
which we can debate

620
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,640
this and we can bring these debates

621
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,760
more mainstream so

622
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,039
and what do you need and we are now

623
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,640
working with the cdm

624
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:08,799
trying to set this platform

625
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,480
because it is something that people said

626
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,559
that they would need

627
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,840
but in general for example now we are

628
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,840
also thinking about communication

629
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,360
we are thinking that each local group

630
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,320
would have their

631
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,719
own communication and their freedom to

632
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,678
to set the program in the way they would

633
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,320
like

634
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,159
but also it would be interesting to have

635
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,720
a common communication with a common

636
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,880
name

637
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,120
so that it's clear that we are part of

638
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,240
the of something

639
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:42,479
together oh someone said

640
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:45,039
oh guess it's three minutes so

641
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,520
yeah i don't know whether i answered

642
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,480
your

643
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:54,840
question um what we ask

644
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,440
in one sentence would be openness

645
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,559
generosity and actual

646
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:05,440
will to do something that is

647
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:09,360
useful for the movement

648
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,919
in a broad way yeah and what we offer

649
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,360
is okay we are nine people in amsterdam

650
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,559
working on this

651
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,520
we have a strong network strong big

652
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,918
networked list

653
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,879
of people here and there and we are

654
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,240
inviting all of them

655
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,480
all kind of i don't know think tanks

656
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,400
um we are talking with extinction

657
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,559
rebellion uk for example these

658
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,840
are one of the guys who will be involved

659
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,918
definitely

660
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:39,039
i don't know yeah

661
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,840
okay so yeah maybe

662
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,240
then it makes sense if we talk after

663
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,559
this

664
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,480
call because this will be over in a

665
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,279
couple of minutes um maybe just want to

666
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,200
give you some

667
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,000
feedback uh about uh yeah or maybe uh

668
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,600
just the last question

669
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,039
on barcelona actually um you said

670
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,879
uh you had a platform there to do the

671
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:04,158
participatory program

672
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,159

673
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,279
don't i don't remember i can but i can

674

were presenting

685
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,879
um like can you remember from when to

686
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,480
like before you started the campaign how

687
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,880
much time went into

688
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:45,600
the preparation process of

689
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:48,799
from signatures to list

690
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,840
from signatures to list

691
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:55,039
and since we got the signatures

692
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:58,480
until the list was something like

693
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,960
eight nine months okay something like

694
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,399
this

695
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,960
yeah because right now we are nine

696
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,719
months away from the elections

697
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,320
so we need to move really really fast

698
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,039
now um

699
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,840
yeah and i think maybe a difference to

700
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,960
barcelona

701
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,240
is um that i'm running for the federal

702
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,240
parliament

703
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,039
but it's kind of a mixture like you want

704
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:22,080
the people from one electoral area

705
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,840
to vote for one direct candidate

706
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,840
and then bring it into the federal

707
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,000
government so there is this link between

708
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,000
national politics and local politics i

709
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,520
think like i need to break down the

710
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,960
global problems into

711
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:38,000
local tangible projects and then

712
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,559
identify where is the national challenge

713
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,919
here

714
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:44,158
um so like i can you know be a

715
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,520
transmitter between the worlds

716
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:51,120
yeah but yeah

717
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,760
these talks always go by too fast

718
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,120
i feel you barely scratch the surface

719
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:13,840
but it was nice to meet you

720
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:13,840
and yeah we can pick it up later on sure

721
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
so

722
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,840
wow

723
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,360
you
