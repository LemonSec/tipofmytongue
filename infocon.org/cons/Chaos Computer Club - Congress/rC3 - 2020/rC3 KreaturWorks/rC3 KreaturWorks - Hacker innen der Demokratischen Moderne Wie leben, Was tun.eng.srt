yesterday uh in the fight against the

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,200
turkish

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,239
proxy army and einither which

52
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,839
they attack at the moment so yeah

53
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,840
this is at the beginning

54
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:27,680
which means my tears never die and

55
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:31,040
yeah so um first a little bit about

56
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:35,360
me and i'm i'm

57
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,480
coming out of east germany i'm

58
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,920
part of or feel part of the anti-fascist

59
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,200
autonomous movement

60
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,518
a long time and got in contact 2015

61
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,440
with the kurdish movement uh why is it

62
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,440
struggling cubano

63
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:54,879
and yes we're out of this

64
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,079
uh also some time go on

65
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:01,120
i i was

66
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,879
made the decision uh to go there to see

67
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,239
the fight because this is like really

68
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,560
yeah to the toronto to go to azerbaijan

69
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,680
because this is like really a whole

70
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,239
beacon in

71
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:18,400
this air world and i had to learn

72
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,959
there what makes this revolution

73
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,000
and what drives us also to see the

74
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,199
values

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,919
and so on um i'm also

76
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,280
feeling really connected to the and

77
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,120
because of that it's

78
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,198
cool that i could can be here if you

79
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,120
really connected to like the ideas of

80
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:42,880
like cyberpunk and i read a lot of

81
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:46,560
william gibson and so on and the idea of

82
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:50,159
fighting actually also um and this

83
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,840
technocratic system uh from within with

84
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,440
uh with like uh like all this

85
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,000
stuff so this is like also like

86
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,440
influenced me a lot

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,320
um and so i'm also like an i.t

88
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,360
professional

89
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,520
and so this was like my

90
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,840
two persons like on the one hand i'm

91
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,039
like uh

92
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,280
uh kind of anarchist guy and on the

93
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,400
other hand i'm like i really like

94
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,039
to play with uh the internet to

95
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,400
to go deep and to find the beauty there

96
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,159
but also like see

97
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:29,198
the really big dangers who lie there and

98
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,800
so this was my perspective of going to

99
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,440
otherwise

100
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,440
and

101
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,199
yeah so

102
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,960
like to start with i maybe should

103
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,639
explain some

104
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,359
uh yeah some of the words are using and

105
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,039
uh the first thing is i want to explain

106
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,160
what is a hacker

107
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,719
and because uh i think

108
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,600
this is for me hacking is not something

109
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,280
which has to

110
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,960
do so much what you

111
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,318
with what you hack so hacking is not

112
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,120
something just i t

113
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,560
people do or hacking is not something

114
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,039
you have to be

115
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,960
you have to know how to program also

116
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,599
hacking is for me more like

117
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,479
a view on the world it's more like to

118
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,479
see something

119
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,560
and the system tells you for example

120
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,639
this is an umbrella

121
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,080
the giveaway in the kurdish mountains

122
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,280
sees this umbrella as

123
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,318
a cave to hide them from

124
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,440
from the drones so for them it's not an

125
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,319
umbrella in the

126
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,280
in the capitalist modernity for example

127
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,680
it's like

128
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,679
uh it's like a tool to protect

129
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,280
themselves and that is happening to me

130
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,080
and so um

131
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,359
there are a lot of other examples of

132
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,080
hacking especially

133
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,080
uh in the struggles in the global house

134
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,120
but also here so it's more like

135
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,400
how you uh how you approach

136
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,479
the world how you see the world and and

137
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,560
yeah how to yeah how to ask

138
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,120
uh questions actually yeah like how to

139
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,120
repurpose the meaning of an object

140
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,039
into i don't know a revolutionary

141
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,199
purpose yes

142
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,159
and i think they are there we come

143
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,240
actually to a

144
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,400
quite interesting point because it's

145
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,639
like um everything

146
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,198
like uh capitalist modernity and

147
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:28,400
democratic modernity is as i like to

148
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,400
uh to terms which learn

149
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,758
uh

150
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,159
yeah one of the leaders of the kurdish

151
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,880
movement that started

152
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,599
the movement like years of elections yes

153
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,639
and

154
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,080
he uh he envisioned these terms and his

155
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,599
books i don't want to go too deep

156
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,198
because i'm also not

157
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:50,878
too uh safe to do this

158
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,599
and uh but for me this

159
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,479
they're connected to hack to hacking

160
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,400
because

161
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,639
it's also like you know everything

162
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,520
around us is built by capitalist

163
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,720
modernity

164
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,280
um every tool we have like also handy

165
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,840
it's the internet everything is like uh

166
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,239
it's like

167
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,440
it's like built uh by the capitalist

168
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,720
majority

169
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,240
but the beauty is within that there is

170
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,000
the democratic modernity

171
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,520
that is resistance yeah there is a

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,840
resistance like

173
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:26,240
there couldn't be a planet or a society

174
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,239
where there's just capitalists

175
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,640
uh probably really ugly coin but um so

176
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,919
like in everything you see around you

177
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,199
and also this is

178
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,920
also uh about us like everything uh

179
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,600
what we are we have like this capitalist

180
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,839
side and we have like the democratic

181
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,959
modernity side

182
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:00,160
hacking for me is like to

183
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:03,839
also a way of uh freeing

184
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,040
uh uh this and like find like the beauty

185
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,080
in like really ugly

186
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,199
things for example um

187
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,200
they're what um uh

188
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,560
there there is like these internet

189
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,000
sticks you you use

190
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,518
to uh get internet and

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,360
then people were looking at it and

192
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,279
they're like no this is not an internet

193
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,080
thing this is actually a device

194
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,080
which you can use to

195
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,680
transfer a lot of you you can use it for

196
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,680
free

197
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,479
and so so they were hacking it and we

198
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,160
are like seeing the full potential

199
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,320
and i think this is what capitalist

200
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,199
modernity is doing with us

201
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,680
they uh they say we can't just go one

202
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,279
way

203
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,319
they say that we just can't do it like

204
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:53,120
like really bipolar

205
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,519
way and actually there are so many ways

206
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,640
yeah

207
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,040
so many possibilities and so

208
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,839
yeah i i hope it's kind of getting

209
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,800
clearer

210
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,279
like so the idea of like how sometimes

211
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,000
capitalism how much denies this reality

212
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,800
and like this and as an opposite you

213
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,240
were talking about

214
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,640
democratic impulse that existing life

215
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,760
in everything that is kind of a

216
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,800
reflection of the

217
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,360
diversity and differentiation and

218
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,800
how one object can be used for many

219
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,240
different purposes for example

220
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:30,079
yes and and this you so

221
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,279
in this way um uh when i was going to

222
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,560
whatever

223
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:37,519
i saw like a lot of hacker because

224
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,920
that's happening there like on the one

225
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,560
hand

226
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,199
and you have like um you have like

227
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,359
really the

228
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,959
problematic situation that you don't

229
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,320
have so much tools or not

230
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,000
so much resources to get so so like

231
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,160
people are getting really creative

232
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,079
but on the other hand like you have this

233
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,199
strong ideology

234
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,079
you know this strong knowledge actually

235
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,680
uh how to live because they're giving

236
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,079
the answers there

237
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,880
in how to live something we don't have

238
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,079
here

239
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,320
and and so combined with like this all

240
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:12,880
creativity

241
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,000
um there's actually like a big force but

242
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,279
the problem there

243
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,720
is uh that

244
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,399
and then we need to talk about

245
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,160
colonialism a little bit more

246
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,959
yeah uh is that uh what

247
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,519
like how how imperialism and colonialism

248
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,000
is working

249
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,600
is actually to take like the resources

250
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,720
from the colonized people

251
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,560
and put it all in the center and me as

252
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,600
i'm coming from center for me it's like

253
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,680
i have had like

254
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,600
all these resources you know i have the

255
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,199
knowledge i had like

256
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,000
i have like a pc and really early stages

257
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,480
so i could

258
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,480
learn a lot and also like approach these

259
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,600
technologies which are used to

260
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,720
suppress people worldwide but i

261
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,920
could have my own approach but in rojava

262
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,959
you often find

263
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,199
people who had not these access

264
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,359
so you have actually like great hackers

265
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,480
there but unfortunately

266
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,320
they're missing some crucial tools to

267
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,560
defend themselves uh

268
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,680
against um yeah against democratic

269
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,560
uh against capitalist modernity and and

270
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,160
these tools

271
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:25,760
are here oh these tools are uh

272
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,439
laying in the centers and then you you

273
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,600
actually get to the point where you come

274
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,000
to like okay this is like the point

275
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,480
where you

276
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,399
get internationalists because then you

277
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,560
realize okay we

278
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,959
um the movements like in rojava but also

279
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,359
like

280
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,518
you it's also like happening in in

281
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,560
mexico for example

282
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,360
or if you look at south america

283
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,959
it's happening all over yeah and i think

284
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,000
we also had like a talk

285
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,560
about guatemala and burning uh some

286
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,920
some nice congress the congress there is

287
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,199
also happening there

288
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:04,479
um so you start to realize okay

289
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,560
to really overcome this um we

290
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,760
need to work together and we need to

291
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,439
connect

292
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,959
and i think this is like one of them

293
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:18,880
yeah main um main learning for me

294
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:22,319
uh and on their worth okay um

295
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,680
they have and in rojava you learn

296
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,920
to live in a way because i

297
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,359
never really learned it in that way and

298
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,040
we also talked before

299
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,040
a little bit more about how hard it is

300
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,480
to come back in this reality here

301
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,319
because there's an internationalist who

302
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,440
went already and come back you know

303
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,079
yeah yeah and because then you then you

304
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,279
actually

305
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,839
have the knowledge about okay what how

306
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,880
could you live and then you need to kind

307
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:52,000
of fit in this reality over here again

308
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,360
and which attacks you and

309
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,560
so yeah the point is to connect and

310
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,839
and i think this is like a thing for

311
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,959
like hacker communities

312
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:08,480
in here in the in the central

313
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,719
uh places of this world and rolling and

314
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,680
germany for sure is one of these central

315
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,800
places

316
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:18,079
uh and i think there is really need uh

317
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,760
to to connect uh to these places and

318
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,839
that means to go there to

319
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,680
learn um as an equal as as equal yeah

320
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,279
and as commerce for sure and actually

321
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,599
you go there and you need to listen a

322
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,360
lot

323
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,320
because we used to know we used who are

324
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,279
talking and

325
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,160
thinking okay we we you know we are at

326
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,199
the forefront

327
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:44,079
which is not true the people uh

328
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:45,680
in rojava and the people in shepherds uh

329
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,839
they are actually at the forefront of

330
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,279
the fight against capitalist modernity

331
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:54,240
so they have some crucial answers and

332
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,079
we need to find our role in this and our

333
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,440
world is

334
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,199
listen there because this is like

335
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,600
because when we do it other way around

336
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:07,599
we are being imperialist again

337
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,240
uh but then come back and start to build

338
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,360
up here

339
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,880
with this knowledge and

340
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,880
build equal connections

341
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,959
in berlin for example yeah how to build

342
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,160
up

343
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,199
communes in berlin and do this with this

344
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,000
approach but also

345
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,639
have in mind okay we need to share like

346
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,839
knowledge

347
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,320
for example so there is this great um

348
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,880
hackers-based movement uh around europe

349
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,600
and

350
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,320
the us and i think it's also slowly

351
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,759
spreading

352
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,079
uh in the global house that i'm not 100

353
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,839
sure

354
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,359
but this is like the thing we need to do

355
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,639
more why is there

356
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,560
are there no people going to watch

357
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,720
around build up hacker spaces

358
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,279
this is like a thing where you know

359
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,040
where you transfer the knowledge

360
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:59,600
and um like this is a really

361
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:01,759
uh yeah because

362
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,399
yeah because when you when you are there

363
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,000
you are like me in front of a technology

364
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,560
perspective i was there and was

365
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,160
expecting okay let's see freyfung

366
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,959
and okay and ah you you actually

367
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,079
uh having like the control over your

368
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,518
infrastructure that's

369
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,079
the infrastructure which is not

370
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,519
capitalist and then you realize okay now

371
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,479
the knowledge is not there

372
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,920
and the infrastructure is difficult to

373
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,920
run without this knowledge and

374
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,279
but to run this infrastructure this is

375
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,439
the need of the society

376
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,079
you need resources you need knowledge

377
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,759
and you need a supportive voters who can

378
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,199
help to mediate that right because there

379
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,959
is a bible

380
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,880
yes right so there are no resources

381
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,638
that's one of the for the context

382
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,120
for people who know rojava but it isn't

383
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,320
invitable from uh well the syrian regime

384
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,160
but also turkey

385
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,360
is attacking them and so they're kind of

386
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,600
like enclosed

387
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:57,680
right so so the cameras over there

388
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,120
need to make like deals with with people

389
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,399
who they actually don't want to deal

390
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,279
with but they need to run the

391
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,039
infrastructure

392
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,959
so and and then you you come back to

393
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,720
uh germany and then you see all these

394
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,799
nice talks about people who

395
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,839
actually have like ideas about that and

396
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,720
then you think okay

397
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,280
this needs to connect because otherwise

398
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,600
uh

399
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,520
house is gonna work when we we need to

400
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,559
share this knowledge we need

401
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,959
uh we need to go there and

402
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,240
actually also we i think this is another

403
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,440
part it's like

404
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,039
to also see because when

405
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,480
where we're now in the world it's like

406
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,720
we are at the brick

407
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,160
like also with this whole corona thing

408
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,440
it's like

409
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,520
burning more and uh

410
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,799
i think we soon will be at the point

411
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,639
where we

412
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,240
in like the western world where we need

413
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,000
to make a decision

414
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:53,440
and uh and we need to also

415
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,480
also we need allies to fight

416
00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:00,320
and we need places to go when

417
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,640
stuff goes really weird and bad here and

418
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,159
doesn't look really well so for our

419
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,559
resistance

420
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,200
we also need roger and this is the same

421
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,799
way around

422
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,840
you know there is no uh

423
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,520
yeah you need to look at it in a

424
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,600
holistic way you know

425
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:22,879
and uh it's not going without anything

426
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,399
and a problem i really see uh in like

427
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,360
this hacker communities here is like

428
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,400
really

429
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,719
they you know they look at solutions

430
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,440
which is fine they look at solutions of

431
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,720
problems

432
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,840
they have but these problems are

433
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,960
not necessary to problems as a struggles

434
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,199
in the global housing

435
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,400
yeah exactly and oftentimes what often

436
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,760
happens is that

437
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,400
technologies try to build uh technical

438
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,679
solutions for political problems and it

439
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,799
should be the other way around we should

440
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,320
like we should look at what the

441
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,039
political problem is and then think

442
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,879
about

443
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,640
you know what sort of technological

444
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,200
infrastructure can we build to solve

445
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,520
them

446
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,320
right or to support that process right

447
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,200
politically

448
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,240
yeah yeah no but but this is also like

449
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,799
this is another

450
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,160
big point in which you also see like in

451
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,000
roger but there you know

452
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,679
there's it's like different around you

453
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
know as a

454
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:20,880
as the people decide

455
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,679
and like the needs of the people are the

456
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,720
other thing

457
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,720
which needs to find you solutions it's

458
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,760
not the other way around that you

459
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,559
you you say okay we

460
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,360
uh this is your needs now like how we

461
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,520
have a

462
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,479
top down it's like how we have it here

463
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,520
it's like you

464
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,120
see all this propaganda

465
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,639
and telling you you need to buy

466
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,879
something this corner thing is a good

467
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,080
thing like before christmas there was a

468
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:53,280
saying that it's like the patriotic

469
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,039
thing you have to buy now and

470
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,799
this is actually not the need of the

471
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:02,158
society at all it's the need of the

472
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,879
of of corporate yeah corporate powers

473
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,760
how how do people decide locally uh

474
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,840
communally

475
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,520
from the bottom of that can you tell us

476
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,799
a bit more about this process

477
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,600
um i can try i

478
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,760
actually was myself not so much involved

479
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,760
in

480
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,240
this local community works i had other

481
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,919
works

482
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,919
but um what for what i

483
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,679
know and what i saw and what i heard

484
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,480
from cameras who were actually in these

485
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,360
works

486
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,720
it's like really you have like you have

487
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,360
like every street

488
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:43,520
uh every like small um kids neighborhood

489
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,559
um has like uh they meet

490
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,440
and then they discuss problems and they

491
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,799
have like

492
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,600
this data structure

493
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,639
um sort of like a console yeah or an

494
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,600
assembly or something

495
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,240
yes where then these problems are

496
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,439
discussed

497
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,919
and there is this strong uh

498
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,640
notion that like problems which can

499
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,679
solve

500
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,200
uh in the community itself it will be

501
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,760
solved there it should be solved by the

502
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,960
way yeah

503
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,720
and for sure should be so so far where

504
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,840
you can see it really good it's like

505
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:21,120
um the self um

506
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,280
the self defense units

507
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,719
which kind of everybody has like their

508
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,639
own self defense units

509
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,320
you you got a little bit confused by the

510
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,120
time because they're also changing names

511
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,320
often

512
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:35,760
but for whatever reasons but

513
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,840
um so you have like in every every like

514
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,158
community the christian community

515
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,918
uh has like the self-defense units and

516
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,400
there are like the woman self-defense

517
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,760
human and so on and so on and they are

518
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,120
controlled by the

519
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,559
local people uh in a in this sense

520
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,639
because they come from there there are

521
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:56,799
other parts of uh um of self-defense

522
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,960
which are then more like on another

523
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,000
stage like yep

524
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,760
this is more this is a different kind of

525
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,320
self-defense because they are fighting

526
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,679
against jesus or like the turkish

527
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,000
um uh the turkish army and so this is

528
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,840
not

529
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,240
like controlled directly by the local

530
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,158
people because that wouldn't make sense

531
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,000
but like for the local self defense or

532
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,000
for like the demonstrations

533
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,600
and this is like this so interesting

534
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,200
because it means that in

535
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,000
in this society what we would call the

536
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,960
police

537
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,520
is actually controlled by people they

538
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,200
they

539
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,200
they're not even police they just they

540
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,240
just are um

541
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,480
in the director uh yeah like

542
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,559
the people basically they respond to the

543
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,640
people instead of to some bureaucrat

544
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,720
or politician or how it happens here

545
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,480
right yeah that's very interesting

546
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,679
i'm not actually sure if i'm allowed to

547
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,440
share the story but i'll share it anyway

548
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,799
because there is like one story i really

549
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,919
like to

550
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,240
which for me like brings brings

551
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,080
like the understanding of police and so

552
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,880
on because this is like a contradiction

553
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,399
also

554
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,880
because like like in 2008

555
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,480
it changed but for example people who

556
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,360
were police before

557
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,520
uh we're in a kind of also in these

558
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,439
policing positions afterwards they're

559
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,639
like in different revolutions after the

560
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,919
revolution in uh

561
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,919
in different kind of structures not all

562
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,159
of them but so the mentality of

563
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,840
like being the police being in charge

564
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,799
and telling the people is

565
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,678
sometimes still there so and so there

566
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,120
was the

567
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,559
but there are also like this local

568
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,239
self-defense force for example for

569
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,120
demonstrations there's not police there

570
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,320
are these

571
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,479
uh happy like self-defense units

572
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,000
yeah the the self-defense unit of the

573
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,000
people so when you make a

574
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,840
demonstration then the self-defense

575
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,520
units of the people are around

576
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:51,439
and not like like a broader

577
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,600
policing unit which is called massage

578
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,480
and so there were like demonstrations i

579
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,520
think it was about

580
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,799
sugar or something i'm not sure um

581
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,240
and it was like big demonstration and

582
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,279
people were really angry

583
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,240
and so these other each forces came and

584
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,080
we are like

585
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,520
because they still had like the kind of

586
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,320
the old mindset we're like oh you are

587
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,158
not allowed to

588
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,678
do this demonstrations here and this is

589
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,960
a dangerous tree forbids the

590
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,279
demonstration

591
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,080
but luckily there was this low deception

592
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,240
transporters

593
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,399
which say well you want to forbid this

594
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,120
demonstration so now we lock you up

595
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,600
yeah but i think it was in cambridge

596
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,678
though

597
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,840
and so the self-defense unit of the

598
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,320
people locked up these other each

599
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,279
forces who actually wanted to forbid the

600
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,760
demonstration

601
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,520
and then i think it was like going a lot

602
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,400
of chaos around and in the end it was

603
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,520
also

604
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,520
but this shows um a little bit

605
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,158
um

606
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,360
so because there was a police unit who

607
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,840
actually you

608
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,479
were still like oh no we we can decide

609
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,559
and then

610
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,919
but yeah when you have like your own

611
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,480
self defense

612
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,279
uh you can actually do with something

613
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,559
about it and

614
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,679
not not being like uh like it's often

615
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,360
over here

616
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,600
and beyond self-defense there's also

617
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,399
like food comparatives

618
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,399
or like different types of organizations

619
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,799
that are all about managing life right

620
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,200
so

621
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:17,039
this structure of bottom mob decision

622
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,200
happens in everything

623
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:23,200
they try to implement it you know yeah

624
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,279
they're like there are parts where where

625
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,840
this is not implemented in this way

626
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,720
yet and i'm actually like i'm two years

627
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,199
here now i'm not

628
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,240
100 sure there is uh the roger

629
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,159
information center

630
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,600
which have like some great resources

631
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,760
about it and uh they have like a pdf

632
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,039
i really recommend looking up project

633
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,400
information

634
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,760
for that because they are much more have

635
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,320
deeper knowledge they make a lot of

636
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,039
interviews with people and so on

637
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,399
so so yeah this is not really my

638
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,840
expertise

639
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,799
and but yeah you you have like a lot of

640
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,639
cooperatives around

641
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,720
especially women cooperatives because

642
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,480
this is like the main value

643
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,799
uh of this like the friends over there

644
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,000
also like it's the women's revolution

645
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,158
and there you see

646
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,919
the progress the most and the woman's

647
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,120
are on the forefront

648
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,279
of the fights and

649
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,799
i think this is also like really an

650
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,440
important part

651
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,120
but there are only uh also only women

652
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,799
groups right apart from the mixed

653
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,239
groups right there are only women groups

654
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,960
that decide and have autonomy

655
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,520
many decisions yes that's that's like

656
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,640
there's an

657
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:38,080
autonomous structure of women which

658
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,440
which is completely autonomous and

659
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,960
there is this uh system of uh

660
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,600
kochia so it means like in

661
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,799
positions that is always like 50 50 like

662
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,480
you have like

663
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:54,158
you have not just one head of

664
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,559
a city or something you have like a

665
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,120
woman's head and uh like a co-president

666
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,918
yes

667
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,879
yeah a co-presidency and that's uh

668
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,640
everywhere

669
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,720
and um that's like a principle

670
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,799
you see in every structure and i think

671
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,840
this is like bringing

672
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,760
um yeah this shows really

673
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,600
how this is going and you actually see

674
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,960
the structures and

675
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,279
cooperatives who which have like most

676
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,679
developed and in the sense are like

677
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:26,960
women structures and women

678
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,799
that is so interesting and can you maybe

679
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,760
tell us a bit about

680
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,960
uh like the everyday lifestyle when you

681
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,679
were there you said you were there eight

682
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,360
months right

683
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,880
yes so every day like how was the whole

684
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,959
daily life there you know you were in

685
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,360
the international mix commune

686
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,240
doing work but how does what does that

687
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,320
look like

688
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,000
though well like my everyday life is not

689
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,000
like the everyday life of

690
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,320
the people in washington to make this

691
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,840
click i'm like

692
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,840
an international community

693
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:03,919
[Music]

694
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:06,600
so so you have like different stages

695
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,559
of being there and um

696
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,719
[Music]

697
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,080
like but normally you you sleep like

698
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,760
together like in

699
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,678
communal places and you have like home

700
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,720
in your life so you sleep together you

701
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:22,399
wake up and it depends on

702
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,720
where you are schedule uh you may be

703
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,639
responsible for the food for the day

704
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,960
this is like the hardest job to rotate

705
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,000
the

706
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,480
cooking but yeah

707
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
day someone is responsible for cooking

708
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,159
and then you have to do this all day

709
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,159
long

710
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,799
but so you wake up then you make

711
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,879
sports together you clean together then

712
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,679
you eat together and then you have like

713
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,720
a

714
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:52,240
meeting where you share its work

715
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,240
like it's about um who is doing what

716
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,600
uh what kind of work needs to be done

717
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,559
and the coordinating of it

718
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,918
yeah and then there are like different

719
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,320
works like there are

720
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,960
for example in the commune we had like

721
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,960
the environmental work

722
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,240
where it was all about the garden but

723
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,559
also it was like

724
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,440
there were works with the society where

725
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,200
people were

726
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:17,200
teaching boxing lessons or something and

727
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,520
they are also like media works or

728
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,679
writing something or making

729
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,679
like like a lot and

730
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,279
so you're doing this works and uh you

731
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,039
then come together in the evening again

732
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,000
and then you have like in like smaller

733
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,200
groups

734
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,880
uh it's called tech meal where you

735
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,799
uh yeah kind of reflect over the day and

736
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,919
not in a really long way it's more like

737
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,120
in a way of

738
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,760
you because often when you go there you

739
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,360
have like

740
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,679
some educations and there you

741
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,719
learn to like see for example patrick's

742
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,559
behavior

743
00:29:52,720 --> 00:30:01,279
or like individualist behavior and a lot

744
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:03,360
and you in this tech means you are

745
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,480
you need to reflect okay where do i have

746
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,559
this over the day

747
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,960
or where do i see it in my cameras

748
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,320
and so therefore there you have the

749
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,000
technical and

750
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,320
uh technique is called technique yeah

751
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,440
self-critique session something yes but

752
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,799
it's actually

753
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,200
like there's misunderstandings

754
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:26,000
techniques are really short so it's like

755
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,559
um and this is also a critic we often

756
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,240
got

757
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,840
in the commune that our techniques went

758
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,200
like for an hour and so and

759
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,199
cameras came and said hey you're taking

760
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,520
it for five minutes

761
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,799
um so you see also the difference

762
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,639
mentalities so

763
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,480
but and and this is kind of like the

764
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,039
daily structure

765
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,240
in the community and this is like also

766
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,600
the communal life and so these

767
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,640
structures you find

768
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,000
i like how to live uh in this way you

769
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,440
find in a lot

770
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,760
of places where you go but this is

771
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,919
working within uh within the movement

772
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,120
like for families or those structures

773
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,279
that are different

774
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,279
and they live their normal family life

775
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,080
in a way but

776
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,440
this these principles are carried out

777
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,519
everywhere

778
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,039
you you find these principles also like

779
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,840
in the military structures but

780
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:18,158
also like in uh yeah in the cooperative

781
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,519
structures when you like work in the

782
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,200
corporations you're also there

783
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,039
you have technique and you're also there

784
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,320
try to uh

785
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:30,000
see this and you also try to communicate

786
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:32,080
uh like chairs work and

787
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,200
so on so interesting because i even

788
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,279
heard that um

789
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,880
the army or the the sort of defense

790
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,360
forces are even democratic

791
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,080
so but i don't know how true that is but

792
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,320
i heard that they

793
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,320
sort of kind of have this technique and

794
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,480
decide who was actually the leader

795
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,480
no

796
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,009
[Music]

797
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:02,240
they have tech minutes and it's really

798
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,840
encouraged to criticize

799
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,799
and uh like there there's often the

800
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,799
story

801
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,120
told where like a small girl and

802
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,720
commander criticized actually

803
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:18,879
the um uh the

804
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,519
leader the lightning um

805
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,320
it's called yeah yeah the leader or the

806
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,399
the commander

807
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,840
the the commander of the forces in

808
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,039
kubano

809
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,158
with a really deep criticizing so so

810
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,279
this is happening

811
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:36,799
uh but uh it doesn't mean

812
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:39,440
um like like who to command

813
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,240
uh this is a different story that it's

814
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,519
not like

815
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,399
in this democratic uh way

816
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,880
decided because that isn't working in

817
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:52,158
the reality there

818
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,159
and yeah you need

819
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,600
your structures to fight to fight the

820
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,919
fight yeah

821
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,799
and you also need to understand you know

822
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,360
this is not like the perfect society or

823
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,960
it's like it's a revolution ongoing so

824
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,918
you also can't

825
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,720
uh can't just give everything away and

826
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,120
say well

827
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,640
you are now a free society without and

828
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,399
then you have actually like

829
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,159
warbands going around because like

830
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,320
patriarchy behaviors

831
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,640
so you need to control this because of

832
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,039
that it's not a really good idea

833
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,320
of when you decide to have like an army

834
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,840
kind of structure

835
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:33,279
um out of a political reason

836
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,760
uh to to give them to have

837
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,640
so this is a nervous okay don't think so

838
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,559
don't don't fall

839
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,559
don't fall for this mistake

840
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,720
lovely lovely lovely um so we have

841
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:50,080
uh about 20 more minutes i'm going to

842
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:53,440
check if there are any questions

843
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:56,480
around here on the chat uh

844
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,960

because the talk was actually like how

853
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,759
to live and i think we did that

854
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,480
we did we did that a lot and but there

855
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,040
was also

856
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,719
what to do it's a very important way

857
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,320
what to do

858
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:33,439
this is for you hackers yeah and

859
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:36,639
so just you know they're like

860
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:40,000
one big problems uh actually uh

861
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:43,200
uh and i also experience this is like

862
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,040
as a terror with which on the society uh

863
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,319
is come from like don't strike

864
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,320
which happening with the yeah

865
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,560
uh which happening not just in boston

866
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,079
it's actually a bigger problem

867
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,560
and so actually the friends sometimes

868
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,440
used

869
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,279
as to a flight radar in france which was

870
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,400
also coming out of

871
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,440
hacking community and so

872
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,640
like an idea which is around but

873
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:14,079
the lack of knowledge and also

874
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:17,118
is actually to implement a way of

875
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:20,480
drawn drone 20

876
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,079
uh 24 7 like like a page where you can

877
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,079
see the movement of the drones

878
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:28,960
oh wow and uh that would be actually

879
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,240
a kind of really useful tool it's not

880
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,440
useful for us here

881
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:36,560
because we don't have drunk strikes but

882
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,760
if you feel the terror uh which this

883
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,599
drone strikes

884
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,960
and and this appearance of the drones

885
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,520
alone have on your

886
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,400
everyday life uh this is like a really

887
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,200
big need

888
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,000
actually in like so like basically how

889
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,078
to create

890
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,280
a a back end that allows you to

891
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,680
detect drones that are flying and

892
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,640
yeah so through some satellite or how

893
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,879
would that work

894
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,799
yeah i would imagine that working i i

895
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,520
think like detecting grounds is actually

896
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,079
not that hard because they are not so

897
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,800
um so so i actually think there would be

898
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,440
also

899
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,640
technical ways to detect drones uh

900
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,000
within like cheap

901
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:18,879
raspberry pi device kind of things um

902
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,160
but the other way would be to give like

903
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,320
people access to like

904
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,759
just say hey here's a drone and so like

905
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,960
have like some

906
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,560
channels uh where you have like trusted

907
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,760
contacts with can

908
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,279
uh yeah and and so that this kind of

909
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,920
threat so then actually

910
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,760
that had like two positive things there

911
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,800
one positive thing is like people in the

912
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,880
region could see oh

913
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,200
there's but the other thing is you

914
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,720
could show the world how much drones are

915
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,118
actually flying around and

916
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,240
terrorizing the people because the one

917
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,079
thing is you don't try

918
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,839
but the other thing is that these things

919
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,240
are constantly over your head yeah

920
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,000
exactly

921
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,839
and uh you feel like okay

922
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,359
could happen any time and you just don't

923
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,240
know and this is like i think

924
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,960
this is like a project if somebody feels

925
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,520
uh

926
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,640
feels uh to do some stuff this is a

927
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,320
project to go in

928
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,920
and the other thing i imagined it

929
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,480
already is like to go

930
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,480
there yeah

931
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,839
experience this but also learn there and

932
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,680
but bring your potential also there like

933
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,520
bring your knowledge there transfer the

934
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,118
knowledge and this can be done

935
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,320
uh like in many ways i think this is

936
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,599
like

937
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,000
um yeah and the other thing is do stuff

938
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,200
here

939
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,280
yeah get organized yeah and really good

940
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,640
examples is like to look at

941
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:43,760
uh like there is a hacker like

942
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,240
she's called phineas fisher uh

943
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,400
look at look her up with she seniors

944
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,359
fisher phineas fisher

945
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,320
she did some great hacking and of banks

946
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,440
and so so on

947
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:58,960
and uh and and her last

948
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,760
uh her last uh announcement uh really

949
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,160
a good one and resist and another good

950
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,000
example which also came out of the ccc

951
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,279
actually as theater comics i think they

952
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,680
don't exist anymore

953
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,640
but they had during the arab spring like

954
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,759
in egypt

955
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,520
through that and also in syria i think

956
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,680
in syria they elated a lot of

957
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,320
surveillance data

958
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,440
i think they provided internet when the

959
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,760
government shut down

960
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,800
the internet so these are good examples

961
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,599
to follow up

962
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,119
like alternative uh not just media those

963
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,079
infrastructures of resistance

964
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,599
yes yeah but also like see what is our

965
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,880
responsibility here

966
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,400
because you know we this resource

967
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,839
transfer will not happen

968
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,960
like fast yeah so

969
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:46,720
so we also need to do with our knowledge

970
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,000
with our resources we need to do

971
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,759
uh good stuff if there are any hackers

972
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,680
out there who would like to support this

973
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,440
idea of building this map for the

974
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,040
drones and stuff how can they get in

975
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,960
touch who can they contact ah

976
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,800
this is a good idea i didn't talk about

977
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,720
this um

978
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,320
but they probably could get in contact

979
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,879
with internationalist community

980
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,400
uh on facebook and they're they're

981
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,560
actually on facebook

982
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,720
but also like they have like email

983
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,759
addresses and so on yeah

984
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,480
with pgp and everything yeah um

985
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,839
[Music]

986
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,880
yeah and uh yeah

987
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,359
on some way or another you will probably

988
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,800
get an

989
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,119
awesome contact with me because they

990
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,320
also know me and so on so like we saying

991
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,680
contact

992
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,920
yeah i think that would be actually

993
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,720
also with any other crazy ideas you have

994
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,440
you can

995
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,759
you can go contact the international

996
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,240
okay

997
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:44,079
because they also used to uh used to

998
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,160
like internationalist this is also

999
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:49,119
another thing approach

1000
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,799
because uh for like other structures in

1001
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,599
rojava for example

1002
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,200
it's a little bit hard to have like us

1003
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,119
with our mental ability

1004
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,040
coming there and you know sometimes i

1005
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,520
say we don't want to

1006
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,359
deal with your mentality anymore go to

1007
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,599
the internationalist community they know

1008
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,119
how to deal with you because you know

1009
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,440
you you come there and you think you

1010
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,200
know

1011
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,200
everything and this is a problem yeah of

1012
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,680
course and especially a problem if you

1013
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,919
were like

1014
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,118
and like this take kind of things

1015
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,720
because then you think you know

1016
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,400
everything and

1017
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,240
you know how to do stuff and just

1018
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,160
actually not working there like this

1019
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,000
yeah the reality is different yes we

1020
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,078
always have to look at your reality

1021
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,119
and where you are and the deciding

1022
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,760
people are the

1023
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,960
silent factor are the people you know

1024
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,280
here you can

1025
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,880
go to like some government and try to

1026
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,760
argue with them and sometimes they will

1027
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,640
listen to you

1028
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,240
if you are a hacker but there you have

1029
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,680
to go to the people and argue with them

1030
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,839
because they will tell you

1031
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,520
what to do and you will not just kind of

1032
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:48,078
go there and say hey we do it like this

1033
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,240
yeah of course because me and my

1034
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,680
european mind is telling you this is the

1035
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,919
right way

1036
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,680
they will really fast tell you that this

1037
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,680
is not the way this is democracy brother

1038
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,799
yeah

1039
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,919
this is another thing's working this is

1040
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,040
also lesson

1041
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,720
on there nice so the teammate values uh

1042
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,319
to wrap up of the revolution as far as i

1043
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,839
understand is democracy

1044
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:15,200
uh women's liberation and ecology

1045
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:18,640
yes and actually this and actually

1046
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,960
um like like

1047
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,400
the women's revolution as youth uh

1048
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,920
structure is also

1049
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:29,599
uh independent in a way so the youth

1050
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:32,640
to use the youngsters the young so

1051
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:35,280
because they are also like um

1052
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,560
it's just important so just to mention

1053
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,240
that

1054
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:42,000
uh that that the youth uh

1055
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,078
has like an autonomous role also in

1056
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,839
ordering this world to play there

1057
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:52,240
and yeah but ecology

1058
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:56,240
liberation and like these autonomous

1059
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,279
things yeah this and this you also find

1060
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,839
here

1061
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,319
you find there but i think it might even

1062
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:05,839
be possible to also find it here too

1063
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:08,400
no this this is the dialectic way

1064
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,960
because of for sure it's here also it's

1065
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,240
also

1066
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,760
like how we are like kind of capitalist

1067
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,439
persons but

1068
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,599
within us there's also like the

1069
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,960
democratic side and we need also to find

1070
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,359
this but

1071
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,160
this is something where you get really

1072
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,160
help in roger

1073
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,759
because they have like a lot of

1074
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,078
knowledge resources

1075
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,280
and how to build this democratic

1076
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,839
confederation of

1077
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,520
you know yeah but also like how to how

1078
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,799
to approach this you know this technique

1079
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,480
has come in your life

1080
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:41,359
uh um so this is all stuff you

1081
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,079
you it's really hard to build here you

1082
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,839
need

1083
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,599
you need these spaces which are

1084
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:49,920
liberated from capitalist

1085
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:53,040
uh to really go deeper because over here

1086
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:56,160
like i from for myself it was like

1087
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:59,440
being there for uh eight months

1088
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:03,440
i made in like just my personal

1089
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:06,560
uh approach on how to fight how to live

1090
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:09,359
uh i made i think over here i would need

1091
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,680
five years to to get there and there it

1092
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:14,799
was like okay it's a month

1093
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,680
i i actually uh yeah learned

1094
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,400
so much so so because of that you need

1095
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,440
these

1096
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,280
these three free spaces

1097
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,720
and this is like the value and because

1098
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,680
of that we need to protect

1099
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,319
also like this is also our fight yeah

1100
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,919
because

1101
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:35,040
without these places yeah uh we will

1102
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:38,560
have a horrible time

1103
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:41,599
so yeah and this is also why

1104
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,680
um this protection uh

1105
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,800
because this is also a question i often

1106
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,440
get asked like

1107
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,800
you say well you you you fighting here

1108
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,920
and so what what does what are

1109
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,240
you bringing to us for example and so on

1110
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,760
and i would always answer well if there

1111
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,680
would be watermelon or places like

1112
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,040
sabotistas or whatever

1113
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:04,078
uh there there wouldn't be hope like

1114
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,319
there was hope for me and uh the friends

1115
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,400
the

1116
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:08,400
cameras over there this is like hope

1117
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,920
that brings me more bosses versus

1118
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,119
you know they're coming i think next

1119
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,640
year yeah they're coming yeah we're

1120
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,680
organizing they're jumping in

1121
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:17,680
to europe and i think uh this is hope

1122
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,359
you know they there are these are like

1123
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,560
the beacons of hope in this

1124
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:24,400
in this world which uh are like in the

1125
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,759
total group of this capitalist

1126
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:30,400
county and uh so they are

1127
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,960
because of that we need to fight yeah we

1128
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,440
need to fight

1129
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,520
we need to we have all these uh

1130
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,280
revolutionary imaginaries of the world

1131
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,680
right so they become stronger together

1132
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,960
yes

1133
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,440
you know and it will just go together

1134
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,880
yeah

1135
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,400
there is and this is like the

1136
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,960
internationalist perspective you know

1137
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,960
you

1138
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,960
it doesn't really matter where you fight

1139
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,400
but uh you need to connect with each

1140
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,960
other and then

1141
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,599
with that fast we we will overthrow this

1142
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,880
yeah

1143
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:59,440
uh but yeah just don't

1144
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,640
divide too much no no we're beyond

1145
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,880
dividing

1146
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,839
we need to go we're dividing we did like

1147
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,839
the last hundred years

1148
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,079
yeah do you have anything else you would

1149
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,359
like to

1150
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:18,560

1151
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:21,759

1152
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,599

1154
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,240
to everybody who sees this

1155
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,240
um and maybe there's a question somebody

1156
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,839
asked just now actually what are you

1157

1158
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:35,920
question

1159
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,000
but i think that's not a question to me

1160
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,119
you know

1161
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,480
but maybe maybe it was related to this

1162
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:47,200
ah yeah maybe this i i'm not

1163
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,200
that you

1164
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,800
another revolutionary group uh in the

1165
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:57,440
south of mexico

1166
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,880

yeah to to come and spread their

1170
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,520
knowledge and to share also

1171
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,880
with the local experiences of resistance

1172
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,160
here so

1173
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,040
watch out for that i think it will be

1174
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,440
here around september maybe

1175
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,119
yeah yeah and yeah with many migrant

1176
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,000
groups and collectives around berlin we

1177
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,920
are uh

1178
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,119
also helping to organize they're coming

1179
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,520
to berlin because they're

1180
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,960
also going to lasalle i think in france

1181
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,280
and also many other parts many

1182
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,119
autonomous places all over europe uh so

1183
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,480
also watch out for that and of course

1184
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,560
if there is an opportunity to connect

1185
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,800
them to internationalists and

1186
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,680
uh to the kurdish movement that should

1187
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,960
