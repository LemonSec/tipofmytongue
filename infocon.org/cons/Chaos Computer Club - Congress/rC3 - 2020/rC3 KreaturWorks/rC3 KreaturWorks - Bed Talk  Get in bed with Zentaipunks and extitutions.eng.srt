rules is not a game

44
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:52,240
ah it's a game under construction

45
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:57,840
it's solidification it's a lyric thing

46
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,840
so then they are holy yeah

47
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,440
yeah it's a open practice

48
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,840
so it's like extreme and gesture so we

49
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:13,440
can experiment with our whole being

50
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,440
exactly what do you want to think today

51

63
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,560
interaction defines

64
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,199
that state in that point of time so jump

65
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:48,639
is about

66
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:51,599
jamming okay

67
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,599

68
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,479

[Music]

71
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:20,160
is about not being anyone because

72
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:22,960
i'm trying to erase

73
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,960
my persona

74
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:31,280
amenti i don't want people

75
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:35,199
to refer to me as i

76
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,679
and so i just decided to be

77
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,680
yellow

78
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,440
hmm today i am yellow which i might be

79
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,440
pink

80
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,680
and the other day after hang on be white

81
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,680
you know

82
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:55,199
what is the result of

83
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,000
letting go of persona and identifying

84
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,800
with

85
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,039
only what you were that day it's not

86
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,080
about unaware it's about korean

87
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,080
and uh basically so if you want to go

88
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,639
deeper ahead to

89
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,800
why we love the center maybe that would

90
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,240
be like

91
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,840
something interesting um it's not about

92
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,280
um

93
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:23,280
who can you be given your identity

94
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,878
and uh when when you do not

95
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,599
when you're not a caller when you're a

96
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,879
person then you cannot be anyone you

97
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,199
wanna do it because

98
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,080
people see you for something that you're

99
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,760
not

100
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,839
just because you look in a particular

101
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,399
manner just because you're particular

102
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,599
gender just because you have a specific

103
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,640
ethnicity

104
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,919
and so you cannot really explore who you

105
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,439
really are because

106
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,319
every single one of your actions and

107
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,200
interactions

108
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,480
are shaped by the subjectivity of the

109
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,800
external world

110
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,000
so you're constrained by whatever people

111
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,800
think you are

112
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,440
and only when you can eradicate your

113
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,240
face

114
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,120
and your persona and your colors and

115
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,880
everything

116
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:11,360
your identity can you actually start

117
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:14,080
exploring your whole colors

118
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,320
so you shed the package in order to

119
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,320
expand capacity

120
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,800
exactly it's about like removing

121
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,240
removing from the outside in order to be

122
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,040
able to add more

zentai is an execution

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:14,079
perhaps executions are about colors

and relationships and it doesn't matter

144
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,359
what is your fault because you have no

145
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,560
identity and so it's

146

all about what you do and

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:28,239
how you do it and before you're doing it

148
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,260
and it's only the individual interaction

00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,240
you think you are an institution

everyone is also an exhibition

you just don't know about it yet maybe

159
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:12,079
maybe maybe if you have difficulty

160
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,319
and you start expressing yourself

161
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,399
instead of speaking as an institution

162
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,480
like an institution

163
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,920
but i'm locked in my role about the

164

institution

165
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,959
but you're wearing a zombie so no one

166
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,519
will know

that you are encouraging the lives so

i'm escaping

discovery

whatever

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,320
can you feel that

179
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,720
if you don't experiment you're always

180
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,480
gonna do what people expect you to do

181
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,839
because you're gonna be subject to the

182
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,839
fast objectivity

183
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,839
of the external world

184
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,040
people tell us what to think people tell

185
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,240
us the stories they want us to tell

186
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,000
ourselves

187
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:39,199
and now we are in a state where

188
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,079
we've lost we've lost ourselves we've

189
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,120
lost we've lost our true meanings we've

190
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,519
lost

191
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,800
we've lost the ability to play we've

192
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:52,800
lost the ability to think and

193
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:56,560
with zentai i feel like i'm finding this

194
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,279
magic and yet it is by losing yourself

195
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,199
it is by

196
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:04,320
losing precisely your identity

197
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:08,160
and self that you can finally found

198
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,720
find your real being that you can become

199
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:14,639
what you really are

200
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,040
since by amazing and science

201
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,040
you can

202
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,319
one thing with institutions is that

203
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,000
they'd like

204
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:29,120
people to know what they want

205
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,760
you to do the exception tells you what

206
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,920
your role is they tell you the story

207
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,040
they tell you what yourself is and you

208
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,240
tell me now

209
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,040
i can lose myself and find myself

210
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,639
because i lose the self that the

211
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,319
institutions gave me

212
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:59,839
and i can find myself through this

213
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:59,839
thing you call executions

214
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,639
maybe we should make a sunday collective

215
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,920
maybe maybe

216
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:13,120
it's funny when we there's what we know

217
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,519
what we know that we don't know and then

218
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,240
we

219
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,279
don't know that we don't know i didn't

220
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,120
know anything about

221
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,240
sentai until we put them on and we're

222
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,240
experimenting now

223
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,320
and it tweaks open the edges the

224
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:32,079
boundaries of our minds

225
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,160
first only by a little bit

226
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,279
but that exploration that play at the

227
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,639
edges you

228
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:41,920
know what might lay beyond

229
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:46,240
i think we forget how to play sometimes

230
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:49,279
we don't want to play how did you play

231
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,840
come on show us why should we play

232
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,070
you should fight

233
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,070

[Music]

238
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,839
is creation the identification is how

239
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,040
families

240
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:32,759
love to live and to become yeah

241
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,719
without notification we will all be just

242
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:38,399
institutionalized

243
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,399
what is this life without play

244
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:45,360
all the life is play

245
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,359
life without play is order

246
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,440
but i think it's a little more catholic

247
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,319
but you can have a lot of objects in an

248
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,279
institutional

249
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,959
settings as well it's just a different

250
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,759
type of problem you should have this for

251
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,399
the viewers

252
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,399
and the horse

253
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,839
and forehead

[Music]

255
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,839
it

256
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,280
second point is about creating a system

257
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:26,319
in which

258
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:28,720
everyone is an eleventh name

259
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,240
it doesn't matter who you are you can

260
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,120
speak your voice

261
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,160
and you are just the same as anyone and

262
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,120
so they will just hear

263
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,000
you and i hear you and i hear you and

264
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,000
it's just like

265
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,840
a common collaborative discussion

266
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,640
without anyone trying to

267
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,439
reach more stages in order to love their

268
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,880
voice

269
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:53,200
so no biases towards

270
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:57,039
status yes it's about the liberation

271
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,039
as opposed to decision making

272
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,640
exactly we want to be able to experiment

273
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,919
with ideas

274
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,080
and show every stupid idea of smart idea

275
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,640
in the earth so that we can

276
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,559
brainstorm and build upon it without

277
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,000
fear of being

278
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,320
anyone or will we reach conflict

279
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,120
we don't need consensus but it's

280
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,399
important to

281
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:25,520
be able to speak of mind purity of ideas

282
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,120
yes without corruption

283
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,918
through reputation

284
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,039
yeah detection and stages is what we

285
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,679
reject

286
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,720
is that by collecting it's not like

287
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,840
stickers

288
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,320
it's not like money only crypto

289
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,760
that's not like money we don't like what

290
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,799
we take

291
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,919
because money is the same as pitch

292
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,679
we use money to purchase stitches we

293
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,600
don't like stitches hard to not like

294
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:58,640
money but we are

295
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,639
happy with crypto

296
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,400
i think zentai fun can be also about

297
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,879
many other things

298
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,679
and one main thing also is that they

299
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,640
have fun

300
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,000
is anti-censorship exactly entire

301
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,760
censorship

302
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,960
and it's about privacy sedanity

303
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,120
and uh basically all those values that

304
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,120
we are promoting on the digital world

305
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,199
about cryptography

306
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,320
actually apply through this

307
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,840
anti-aliasing

308
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:39,200
physical world it is a physical analog

309
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:42,720
cryptographic medium

310
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:47,919
hmm physical

311
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,919
analog crypto that's why we like the

312
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
classes

313
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,280
well this is kind of a message to the

314
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,600
ccc i think which is

315
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,399
um you know there's a lot of focus on

316
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,799
the digital

317
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,120
and we have all digital beings here you

318
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,679
know just bits of colors

319
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,799
um and this physically is oftentimes

320
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,919
about like

321
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:21,440
you know hardware and stuff but

322
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:25,120
it's not about social

323
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:29,039
social privacy and

324
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:32,639
privacy hygiene in the physical world

325
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,640
we don't often think about that

326
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,640
we don't have many tools to promote our

327
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,799
privacy

328
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,919
and of cedenity and our freedom of

329
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:49,039
expression

330
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:52,960
in the physical world what can we do

331
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:56,559
we can collectively create

332
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,960
do you know how to do that collectively

333
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,960
what

334
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:09,760
is i would like to create

335
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:13,000
not only uh with a status

336
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:16,158
of a creator for me

337
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,919
materiality colors

338
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,960
are also the creators

339
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:26,240
and zentais is

340
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:30,559
enabling us to see

341
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:34,640
beyond the persona of the creator

342
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:38,879
and listen to the materiality

343
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:42,840
and what the materiality has to

344
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,520
say about it we are like

345
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:49,039
paintbrushes yeah you can make

346
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:52,400
the hallways we got fun we can make

347
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:56,080
drawings with ourselves

348
00:21:52,400 --> 00:22:00,559
but we can also perform yes

and there is no guy hector no

350
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:06,639
no they are just participants exactly

351
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,159
participants but an object can be a

352
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,660
participant

353
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:15,280

355
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,918
a software can be a participant

356
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,400
together they make an assemblage yes

357
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:29,360
together they make an assemblage

358
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:33,360
tell me assemblages

359
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,039
are something more expensive than a

360
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,840
collective

361
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:41,840

expensive

363
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:49,200
yeah so in a collective you have people

364
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,799
uh that are constituted a collective in

365
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,280
an assemblage

366
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:58,400
you can have people forms

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,760
we form an assemblage that is somehow

373
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,000
working

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:23,600
in a becoming state

within this assemblage and evolving

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,840
together

378
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:37,039
we might be able

with each other and explore the

just for simple interaction

and we don't need to think about why

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:08,320
and who and where and when

387
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:11,360
it's like doing it in the present

388

just for the simple interaction

389
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,799
of this object put together into an

assemblage

391
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,000
that activates the potentiality that we

392
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,360
didn't know

393
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,799
we had hmm can you tell

394
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:28,879
us can you tell me a story

395
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:31,360
about such an assemblage

396
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,320
such an assemblage well let's take this

397
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,520
example

398
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,960
of uh this bunch of creatures

399
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:42,000
living creatures like gingers

400
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,279
dead creatures like they're bad not dead

401
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,400
just non-living and then you know

402
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:51,600
a bunch of humanoids

403
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,799
so what are we really doing here um

404
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,080
we don't really know and yet one day we

405
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:00,559
met

406
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:04,399
and uh and then somehow it happened that

407
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:08,639
the postman amazon

408
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,320
found a bunch of outfits into a house

409
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,320
and we didn't really know what the funk

410
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,279
it was about

411
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,840
and we just worked them and all of cedar

412
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:20,000
magic

413
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,799
happens and all of steven

414
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,480
realized that we could do anything like

415
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,840
go to lidl

416
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,760
and purchase a can of coke with a beach

417
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,760
cart

418
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,279
who could have found they could ever do

419
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,120
that

420
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:41,120
oh organized a fantastic

421
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:44,158
uh a fantastic

422
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,320
um involving and uh

423
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,080
and involving each other with all those

424
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,480
capacities

425
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,360
and um and behaving in ways that we have

426
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,679
never before

427
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,600
behaved exactly maybe when we were

428
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,799
children i don't remember ever behaving

429
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,320
in that way

430
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:03,520
but embodying the

431
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:07,039
just owning

432
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:09,360
the absence of identity

433
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,080
not being able to see others reactions

434
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,320
properly so

435
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,439
not performing in a way that makes us

436
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,559
subject

437
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,720
to what these people around us hope for

438
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,240
us to behave like

439
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:25,200
but tumbling and laughing and just

440
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,640
gibbering in languages that don't exist

441
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,120
and

442
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,960
enjoying it riding around playing

443
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,719
jumping hopping in ways that we don't

444
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,400
normally do

445
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,039
why not perhaps we haven't been

446
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,840
inspiring others

447
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,400
maybe more people can understand the joy

448
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,840
of

449
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,080
faithlessness and

450
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,918
maybe one day they will try to

451
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,678
experiment themselves

452
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:55,039
and more and more people will be feared

453
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:59,600
on the institutional version

454
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:07,840
that is corrupting them become afraid

455
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:07,840
do you kill female yes hmm

on the internet

know what we're talking about and yet

471
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:09,678
when we go out in the street to buy

472
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,439
coke at little we expect everyone to

473
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,320
know and we don't find it

474
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,120
concerning that that we have absolutely

475
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,720
no way

476
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,199
of finding the fact that we're

purchasing a can of coke

478
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,960
this is extremely strange that even

479
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,039
though we all have built

480
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:29,120
so much desire of actually

481
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,720
protecting ourselves from protecting our

identities in the digital world

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,399
we are not doing it in the physical

world

488
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:46,559
um where we can really play we can

489
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,240
incorporate and we can assimilate the

490
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,200
identity of anyone

491
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,960
yeah but why do we we can only do it

492
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,960
very shortly we can do it with like

493
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,399
mask and fingering like caravan and

494
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,399
stuff like that but

495
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,918
that is very strange you know in a

496
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:04,320
day-to-day basis

497
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:07,760
to wear a mask especially in times

498
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,000
so this is kind of like the possibility

499
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,799
of

500
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,200
really enjoying the same experience that

501
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,520
we

502
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,799
all have loved and discovered through

503
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,639
the internet

504
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:21,600
the possibility of but expanding

505
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,360
the reach of our persona and

506
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,918
communicating privately

507
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,600
and acting privately and not leaving

508
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,039
traces everywhere

509
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,080
especially today in which there are

510
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:35,520
cameras at every corner

511
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:38,399
so it is bots it is

512
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,440
it is privacy it is censorship

513
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,600
resistance

514
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,440
and it is expansion of self and

515
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:49,039
experimentation

516
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:52,399
is it a whale say with this sedonamity

517
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:55,600
to incarnate whatever you want

518
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:59,120
whenever you want and so

519
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,158
expand your imagination you don't have

520
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,360
any limit

521
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,120
with the pseudonymity am i right there's

522

i know someone knows the joy of unboxing

530
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,520
unboxing the unboxing like the revealing

531
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,720
of what's inside

532
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:36,240
the zentai is the unboxing it just

533
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:39,039
looks very different instead of opening

534
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,150
we are putting on the zentai to reveal

535
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,339
what else is there

we we have to we have to hide in order

to reveal

540
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,480
this is also very expectational unboxing

541
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,080
because

542
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:03,279
i think institutions they

543
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:07,199
give us boxes to be in

544
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:11,919
and executions help us to remove the box

545
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,919
and as you said see what else

546
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,639
the joy of unboxing through zentai

547
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
mm-hmm

548
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:33,840
unboxing now yeah

549
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,000
you know the joy of unboxing

550
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,760
i love it

552
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,799

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,639
enticing sushi

554
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:51,918
tool as well is that it doesn't allow

556
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,320

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,840

562
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,519
only reason you will be covering your

563
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,640
face is because you have something to

hide

don't want to show it

because of the words

everyone else gets constrained

575
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,679
just because there might be ones

anti-criminal

the freedom that hiding brings exactly

so this is less about crime and more

about freedom

now

well i think as this relates to

605
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,240
the way that privacy is seen as

606
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,879
something that

607
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,719
people don't necessarily need if they

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,759
have nothing to hide

609
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:42,638
and they think that this is a broken

there is another intelligence

620

and the art world doesn't want him

621
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,439
to be part of the art world because they

behind the artwork of this assemblage

the artwork is looking for

the persona behind the creation

to entitle the creation

as an artwork do you think we can

work on that and try a way

be finally recognized as an artist

that is creating an office is

653

completely ridiculous and by eliminating

654
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,118
our identities

655
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,319
we don't have this drive towards

656
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,880
acquiring

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,960
for itself

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,078
we only want the artwork to exist and to

try

the software can also be part

if you are hazardous

hmm so

674
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:12,320
how can we can you say

675
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,520
how we can plug our sentai collective to

676
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,880
the outward

677
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:20,320
because somehow i have the feeling that

678
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:25,440
we need to by

679
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:28,560
erasing all those boundaries we need to

680
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,000
create some ways to

681
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:35,200
talk to the afterwards and be

682
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,680
accepted by it you know

683
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:42,720
that i think i think we are art

684
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:47,440
do you think this is art yeah

685
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,439
is this out thank you sir yeah

686
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,200
so we are part of the outworld perhaps

687
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,280
the art world is not part of the art

689
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,560
you should ask our friends yes

690
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,320
i think the economy that they are from

691
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,200
is very institutional

692
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,160
and whatever question is do we as not

693
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,919
like thanks

694
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,399
do we want to become part of this

00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,520
institutionalization

696
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:15,839
ah do we just foster

697
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,839
the execution of our world

698
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:31,440
yes how can we do this

699
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,920
by playing without trolls

700
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,000
is that nice and it's not about

701
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,640
behaviors

702
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,280
yeah really are still playing by the

703
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,319
wheels

704
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,880
yes recognizing the rules as well it's

705
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,680
about

706
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,200
playing and it's about ignoring those

707
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:56,399
rules i'm just

708
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:59,040
going to use organic and emergency

709
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,880
and vitification causes which is what

710
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,000
art should be in the first place

711
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,119
it's just like expressing yourself and

712
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,680
just

713
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:11,839
doing what feels the most fun and

714
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,839
creative at the moment

715
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:29,359
is the perfect performance

716
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:32,480
[Music]

717
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,480
this is my friend

718
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:44,000
what's your friend's name oh

719
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,000
i think he's she's getting screen

720
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:54,988
i think it is a software yeah

721
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:54,989
[Music]

722
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:11,759
of being an institution those

723
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,440
die slowly it's okay you don't need to

724
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,440
get scared of the institution

725
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,839
it's about letting your exhibition

726
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:22,000
express itself inside of the institution

727
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:24,799
inspiring maybe with practice

728
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,599
with wearing the zentai more often it

729
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,760
would be

730
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,000
unboxing layers what do you mean don't

731
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,040
you wear this anyway all the time

732
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,440
how is it dipping in and out of the

733
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,720
institutional and the execution

734
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,599
lenses that give both meaning but you

735
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,118
know it's um

736
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,880
it's like the institution is like a

737
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,400
master and

738
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,960
indeed like as as you wear the sunflower

739
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,920
and you can experience an experiment and

740
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,560
train

741
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,079
your extritional muscle and then

742
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,960
sometimes by mystic

743
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,079
you remove the suit but the muscle is

744
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,000
still there and you

745
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,720
keep yes and acting in an executional

746
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,040
manner

747
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:10,240
yes and you understand when to play

748
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:13,680
exactly and you can access that play

749
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,919
very very easily once you've practiced

750
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,598
once you've trained the muscle unbox the

751
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,079
layers and layers and layers

752
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,839
like past the parcel you go around and

753
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,839
you take off a layer each time

754
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,880
you discover what's inside and the good

755
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:28,160
is that

756
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,160
we should today now our default mode is

757
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,440
to be institutional and we need to put

758
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,480
effort and exercise in order to

759
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,680
move into the expeditionary being and

760
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,800
the objective

761
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:44,160
of the santa fe collective

762
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,920
is that extitional being comes fast and

763
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,960
only when we want to be exhibition and

764
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,960
we have to fight a mask

765
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,480
when we want to be institutional we put

766
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,040
on the mask

767
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,040
yes yes yes exactly

768
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:04,240
so the default state is the state of

769
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:07,439
accessibility to our capacity yes

770
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:10,399
being able to easily access capacity box

771
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,400
only when we need to

772
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:29,260
it's anti-punk funk

773
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:32,339
[Applause]

774
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,339
[Music]

775
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:44,170
huh

776
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:49,049
[Laughter]

777
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:49,049
[Music]

778
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,839
wow

779
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,920
