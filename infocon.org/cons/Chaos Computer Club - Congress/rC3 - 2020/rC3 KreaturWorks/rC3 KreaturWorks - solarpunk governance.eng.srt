you can just take a moment to

sense into your breath

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,359
and take a deep breath in

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,800

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:45,839

[Music]

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:04,479
the feeling of your sitting bones

with your hands on your lap

[Music]

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,400
take a moment to think of everything

19
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,730
that is solid

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,200

[Music]

26
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,320
and we're just taking a moment to call

27
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,839
into mind everything that is

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,839
solid and earth element

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,840
in your body

30
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:56,320
your teeth take a moment to

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,320
say hello to your teeth bones

32
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,159
and the material of your bones calcium

carbonate

34
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,160
the same material as the one out in the

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,160
world making up the rocks

36
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,839
the same atoms in your bones as those

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,840
that make up

38
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,840
the cliffs outside

39
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:37,840
and all the time we're actually shedding

40
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,840
atoms shedding skin shedding hairs

[Music]

42
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,840
and as we focus into this solidity that

43
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,840
we share

44
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:54,160
with the world outside

45
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,840
with atoms that have traveled

46
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,840
through billions of years to be there

[Music]

48
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,760
we allow ourselves to imagine

49
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,260
these solid atoms traveling now

50
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:15,200
in a different direction

has one of these physical parts of our

[Music]

56
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,030

speed up time

[Music]

59
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:46,000
perhaps we become rock

60
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:48,720
and then become human again

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,720
a different time

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,679

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,920
liquid in our body

65
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,280
can take a moment to presence with the

66
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,920
saliva

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,920

69
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:17,760

moisture in your nose

72
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:43,600
take a moment to feel into the pulse in

your blood

74
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,680
and now think again of everything liquid

75
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,000
outside of your body

76
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:55,280
vast oceans rivers

rains and clouds

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,639
water in the soil

79
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,600
imagine the water inside other living

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,840
out in the world

continuous with that liquid outside

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,560
and the water molecules in your breath

89
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,039
coming out of your mouth right now are

90
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:52,000
the same molecules acted on

billions of years ago by plants

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,520
you might even share a molecule a water

molecule

94
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,080
in your mouth right now with a dinosaur

liquid

to speed up its cycles

[Music]

107
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:54,719
slowly you allow your

your atoms and parts of yourself

109
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,440
to assemble

in this distant but immediate

time

112
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:14,840
a time that looks

113
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:17,280
quite different to this time but still

114
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,599
recognizable

115
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,440
if you imagine all of the micro changes

that have happened

117
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:31,840
it's tiny decisions that

118
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,840
have led us to a different way of living

119
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,960
and

120
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:47,199
you tune into a discussion

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,199
amongst three friends

122
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,919
three beings who were alive in 2020

123
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:01,370
but who have sped through

124
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,879
the hallways of time channels of time

for the last

132

57 or so years

133
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,760
to look back on the year that has passed

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,120
look back on the many years that have

135

passed

136
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,120
and plan into the future

set goals ambitions

138
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:50,000
but also share disappointments

mistakes failures

140
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,839

are you there here

150
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,880
good i think we've established

151
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,880
connection

152
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,480
zentai punk what what how are you tuning

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,480
in today

154
00:09:52,959 --> 00:10:00,719
um i'm tuning from my

155
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,720
stream oh nice

156
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,959
yeah it tastes like um there is not a

157
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,079
there is not a good stream connection

158
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,079
uh but i can hear you

159
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,320
good i i'm trying out the latest

160
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,839
hologram

161
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,680
technology but it's a bit it's a bit

162
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,399
glitchy they haven't managed to do the

163
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,760
mouth

164
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,000
very well but um

165
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,760
yeah sadly i can't be physically

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,640
physically in the stream today but

167
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,360
hopefully this will

168
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:34,720
this will be all right um

169
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,320
yeah how where do we start

170
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,079
i haven't actually made a plan for this

171
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,480
i just thought you know we'll just log

172
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,599
on and kind of work it out as we go

173
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,320
well we basically have two days left

174
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,279
um before we need to start the work

175
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,279
again

176
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,279
uh so i think like we could just have a

177
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,320
little catch-up of um

178
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:57,439
you know uh what have we done

179
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,440
what is left on our to-do's and um

180
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,839
and what needs to be done for the year

181
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,839
ahead

182
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,839
yeah i got into quite a reflective mode

183
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,519
actually i was thinking back

184
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,040
i was just thinking back to this you

185
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,240
know i know we're meant to look back at

186
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,040
just the year past

187
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,200
but i don't know especially the last 20

188
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,719
years has been so

189
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,839
mad and sometimes it feels like it's

190
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,200
just happened

191
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,200
in a day it's just so much has changed

192
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,640
so quickly

193
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,079
um i'm really i'm really curious to hear

194
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,880
about um

195
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,359
feitopian boy about your what's happened

196
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,519
in the kind of legal

197
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,640
research you've been doing and nature

198
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,000
rights

199
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,000
and what's what's happened there

200
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:54,399
well it's been a long long journey

201
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:57,519
i mean starting back a hundred years ago

202
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:00,480
when christopher stone wrote his seminal

203
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,639
article on should trees have standing

204
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,279
wow it's amazing to think that was a

205
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,279
century ago

206
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,279
1977. wow

207
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:17,040
it really was a visionary

208
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:20,480
sentiment to think about

209
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,760
nature as deserving and belonging

210
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,240
amongst the

211
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,839
criteria that we think about when we

212
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,160
look at governance

213
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,160
making decisions about

214
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,560
how all of us can

215
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,839
recognize be aware

216
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,200
keep track of and monitor what we're

217
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,720
actually doing in this world

218
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,519
that's been the toughest struggle i

219
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,959
think of the last century

220
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,639
but i'm so hopeful that we're getting

221
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:01,119
somewhere now

222
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:04,320
we actually have ways of bringing

223
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,920
trees our local bioregions into

224
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,959
consideration when we think about

225
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,920
all the different decisions we're making

226
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,920
and that's been one of the

227
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,000
the missing pieces i think from the way

228
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,519
that

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,959
institutions have been looking at

230
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,480
this ordering this coordination that

231
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,160
they

232
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,720
have been set up to do but as punks i

233
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,079
think we

234
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,320
recognize that the

235
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,279
default standard behaviors and norms

236
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,279
that institutions and organizations have

237
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:45,519
been trying to

238
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:48,720
corral us into can never truly be

239
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,279
complete and

240
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,880
yeah reflecting back on this last year

241
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,480
like you said reflecting back on the

242
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,680
last hundred years

243
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,040
how nature has stepped forward and we've

244
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,040
supported how we can bring nature into

245
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,079
the conversation

246
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,199
uh with actual

247
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,839
the actual ability to listen i mean

248
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:15,599
solopunker you've been working on their

249
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:18,639
our new listening devices um

250
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,639
tell me how that's going

251
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,480
well it's been tough to get that last

252
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,959
grant

253
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,079
i mean honestly sometimes it feels like

254
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,959
all the

255
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,920
research grants are somewhat biased to

256
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,279
the ais

257
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:39,439
as opposed to the more than human

258
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:42,480
um but you know i still i still remember

259
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,240
our first more than human council

260
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,800
in 20 28. gosh i was

261
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,440
i think i was in my in human years and

262
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,279
in my

263
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:57,040
30s then um

264
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,800
and you know it's just very funny to

265
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,000
think about how we started off how

266
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,920
clunky that was

267
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,120
with our you know using these methods of

268
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,920
play and imagination

269
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,199
um and and there was a period of pretty

270
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,360
wacky

271
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,279
research where i think most people

272
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,560
thought

273
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:21,680
we were completely losing our minds

274
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,040
you know i remember one of the people

275
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,680
from my research group

276
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,719
going and spending two years sitting

277
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,638
with a tree

278
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,480
just trying to get a sense of how

279
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,399
how we could speak on behalf of those

280
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,000
beings

281
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,680
and obviously since then we've got the

282
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,440
technology now to

283
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,880
you know allow us to decode some of

284
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,120
those messages and

285
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,079
you know use the kind of physiological

286
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,279
patterning

287
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:51,439
of of trees and plants to get a sense of

288
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,639
what they what they would like us to do

289
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,959
on their behalf

290
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,320
but at the beginning it was purely

291
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,719
imagination

292
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,519
that that was allowing us to you know

293
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,920
deeply

294
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,440
listen not just to the more than human

295
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,040
world but also to that

296
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,600
part of nature that lives within

297
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,599
ourselves

298
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,120
and it's just it's really funny to think

299
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,079
back to

300
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,480
the concepts and the kind of ways of

301
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,439
being and understanding that

302
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,320
you know back in the in the 20s and the

303
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,720
30s

304
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:27,920
were considered you know somewhat um

305
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,560
alternative or kind of avant-garde

306
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,880
um and and in some cases quite quite

307
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,359
flaky i guess much like the psychedelics

308
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,839
psychedelics were considered back in the

309
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,839
1900s

310
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,839
you know and now obviously that

311
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,320
psychedelics are fully integrated within

312
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,199
our

313
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,959
education system so just so much has so

314
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,000
much has changed

315
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,560
um i think looking back it gives me

316
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
hope that when you're trying to do

317
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,920
something

318
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,920
when you're trying to change kind of

319
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,439
fundamental patterns of

320
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:04,480
the way we perceive and what we value

321
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,240
and how we make sense of the world at

322
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,280
the beginning

323
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,599
you're always going to seem like someone

324
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,160
who

325
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,000
who's you know maybe a little bit losing

326
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,600
it or or even unrigorous

327
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
but actually we've been developing that

328
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,799
rigor um

329
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,439
so things that were once on rigorous now

330
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,319
you know we've got our protocols around

331
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,799
um into you know integrating the more

332
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,559
than human into our governance and

333
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,360
it's kind of bizarre to imagine

334
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,760
institutions without a voice of nature

335
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,439
within you know within the the

336
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,280
governance and boards

337
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,799
um anyway i don't think i'm making much

338
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,160
sense i'm just kind of i'm just

339
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,360
freestyling here and

340
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,039
um just kind of remembering these

341
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,719
moments

342
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,720
i know we wouldn't have been able to do

343
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,000
it without the the collaboration with

344
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,120
zentai punk's

345
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
um governance

346
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,399
protocols um and the way you know the

347
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,440
way

348
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,960
you guys have used technology to to

349
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,520
allow us to

350
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,400
govern on kind of planetary scale i mean

351
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,679
that's just been

352
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,679
amazing to work with you

353
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,039
yeah well right now you know like um i'm

354
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,480
still trying to fix a few bugs

355
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:21,520
um it seems like um

356
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,880
somehow the ais and the

357
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,760
trees are not really uh going along

358
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,840
together

359
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,799
there is like a little bit of a debate

360
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,959
happening

361
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,840
um and uh we don't manage to reach the

362
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,880
consensus

363
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,959
as to like uh the next um

364
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,720
the next the next regenerative

365
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,039
agriculture strategy

366
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:46,480
uh the ai somehow is really pushing

367
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:49,520
um towards having a little bit more

368
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,240
of um bioengineering happening

369
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,160
whereas somehow the trees are actually

370
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,120
pushing back on that

371
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,240
and um so we're trying to you know

372
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,199
involve a little bit

373
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,160
extra um extra parties into the

374
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,080
discussion

375
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,520
uh we were thinking maybe the birds

376
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,879
could uh could be

377
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,520
called in um into the into the

378
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,120
night but um yeah i don't know like i'm

379
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,840
trying to i'm trying to work it out

380
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,000
because

381
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,039
the ai have always been on the side of

382
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,400
the trees

383
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,960
uh it's only like since a few months

384
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,440
that uh there's this discrepancy and we

385
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,039
haven't

386
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,640
found we haven't understood the source

387
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,640
of the discrepancy

388
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,080
so i'm a little bit concerned actually i

389
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,039
have to say

390
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,320
um yeah i don't know like the the the

391
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,440
governance structure

392
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,080
is still working out but i really don't

393
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,600
know like

394
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:45,840
what's up um what's up with the ais like

395
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:48,879
somehow um yeah they got this aligned

396
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,439
uh and maybe we just need to like have

397
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,679
them

398
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,880
uh train a little bit further on the

399
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,480
three language

400
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,480
i don't know i don't know if it's like a

401
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,640
misunderstanding between

402
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,600
a communication problem or whether they

403
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,600
actually disagree

404
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,600
that sounds tough yeah it's a bit tough

405
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,000
so i'm i'm debugging

406
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,439
i i will i will let you know a bit more

407
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,360
in a few days

408
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,280
um i noticed um

409
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,879
on on a different topic i noticed

410
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,879
fatopian boy that you use the word

411
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,799
institutions which i thought was quite

412
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,799
you know quite avant-garde of you seeing

413
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,240
as we you know we all decided we'd stop

414
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,520
using that word

415
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,919
about a couple years ago yeah i i was a

416
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,960
bit shocked also to hear that

417
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,120
yeah i yeah what what were you

418
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,640
what did you mean there how come you

419
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,239
were using that word again

420
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,360
i i know it's an anachronism

421
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,039
and we work so hard to

422
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,959
shift the dialogue away from this

423
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:53,360
one-sided perspective

424
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:56,559
and i think ever since the the research

425
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,000
group started working on the notion of

426
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,200
executions

427
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,640
uh i think the the the

428
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,640
just looking at things from that one

429
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,320
perspective i i 100

430
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,320
agree it's it's it's very

431
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,679
biased to be thinking just from the

432
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,679
perspective of the

433
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,880
these these structures we've we've come

434
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,880
so far since then and we're able to

435
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,240
as you were referencing solar pump girl

436
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,520
really

437
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:27,280
consider these broader resonances uh

438
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:30,639
in terms of the the bioregion the

439
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:33,760
use of iot to actually

440
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:37,039
listen in on a technical level but also

441
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,000
the use of councils of all beings to

442
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,158
actually fully resonate in but i think

443
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,880
it's useful to

444
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,559
see how far we've come uh by by thinking

445
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,640
about institutions and

446
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,240
and that's why i went back 100 years to

447
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,600
christopher stone's article because i

448
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,919
think

449
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,719
when we used to think about the law it

450
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,840
was

451
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,200
all about the way that these

452
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:03,120
institutions

453
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,120
structured things in their own

454
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,760
image for their own goals

455
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:13,200
and it was it

456
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:16,240
felt so

457
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,840
all encompassing and overbearing

458
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,640
to have these disembodied goals

459
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,039
structuring our system in ways that were

460
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,159
so out of alignment with

461
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,400
our core goals and

462
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,080
yeah it just made me reminiscent

463
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,520
thinking about goals now as we're

464
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,039
gathered here at the end of the year as

465
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,679
we do every year

466
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:40,320
to think about our individual goals and

467
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:44,000
how those relate into these

468
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,000
collective extitutional goals

469
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:51,440
to think about how we were so so

470
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,439
railroaded again to use this old

471
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,840
anachronistic term but you know we were

472
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,240
on tracks we didn't have the freedom we

473
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,918
have now to really fly where we want to

474
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,320
to soar and gather

475
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,400
emergently with our tree friends and our

476
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,678
ai friends into these assemblages of

477
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,240
intent

478
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,280
once upon a time i think most people

479
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,679
didn't really

480
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,960
get to even think about their goals and

481
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,520
certainly we didn't think about the

482
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,919
goals of nature

483
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,918
and so

484
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:28,720
right now we have this challenge where

485
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,840
as zentai punk has said we're getting

486
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,960
some misalignment again between

487
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:38,000
the ai assemblages and

488
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,400
what we're hearing from nature and the

489
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,880
bioregion around us and

490
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,960
maybe it's worth bringing in just a

491
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,559
little

492
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,240
history around how we got here from

493
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,720
being completely dominated by

494
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,159
institutions that structured

495
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,400
the systems of economic and social

496
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,919
dynamism that was leading us down a

497
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,000
certain path and

498
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,880
and how we veered away from that because

499
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,919
i think in these pivotal moments when

500
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,960
there's

501
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,880
potential misalignment we need to go

502
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,200
back to our punk roots

503
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,039
and think about you know what is it

504
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,080
about

505
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,320
the freedom and the liberty to consider

506
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,039
the unconventional

507
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,520
that really drove us forward to where we

508
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,520
are today

509
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,879
yeah so i have to say something just

510
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,320
because like i'm really like

511
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,919
a little bit struggling here um

512
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,600
i don't know you know like i'm afraid

513
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,600
that um like

514
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,719
i'm afraid that we're actually we've

515
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:44,080
been moving on so fast in the past uh

516
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,760
70 years and uh i mean of course great

517
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,720
we

518
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,600
we really nailed down on the executions

519
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,039
and like

520
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,799
i think of course society is like

521
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:59,279
much more fluid and dynamic and

522
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,559
and decentralized as it used to be uh

523
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,559
but i have to tell you like i'm a bit

524
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,678
concerned by those ais

525
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:08,879
it's as if they had like uh somehow

526
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,799
find a way to coalesce

527
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,039
uh and to create like this kind of

528
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,760
rhizomatic network

529
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,400
but i'm not so sure where it's going

530
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,320
like

531
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,880
somehow i'm wondering whether we might

532
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,120
need perhaps to reintroduce

533
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,159
at least a little bit of institutional

534
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,918
scaffolding

535
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,520
just to make sure that the execution

536
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,799
that we have created until now

537
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,279
actually maintains itself without being

538
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,360
easily corrupted by those ais

539
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,720
are basically like and i'm not talking

540
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,879
about all of them it's really it's a

541
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,400
little subset it's a little rhizome

542
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,000
of ai's that somehow is kind of going in

543
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,080
a strange direction

544
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,840
and again like maybe it's a bug maybe

545
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,639
it's just my fault i did something wrong

546
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,320
with them

547
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,159
uh maybe they don't they don't

548
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,399
fully understand what's going on around

549
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,840
but there is something wrong there

550
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,600
and i'm wondering like shall we not like

551
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,439
is it is it okay like are we not just

552
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,799
doing the same mistake that uh

553
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,919
our former uh society have done which

554
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,240
was just like

555
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,080
focus only and exclusively on

556
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,120
institutions for forgetting everything

557
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,600
about execution and i feel like maybe we

558
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,639
have overreacted and we have like we

559
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,918
because we saw

560
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,400
all the all the negativity and all the

561
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,000
drawbacks of institutions we just

562
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,080
decided to completely reject

563
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,480
them but sometimes i have to tell you

564
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,520
i'm very tempted to codify

565
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,440
a little bit of rules and holes into

566
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,960
these ais

567
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,480
i haven't done it yet because of course

568
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,679
i'm a little bit afraid of

569
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,240
retaliation somehow but i have to tell

570
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,120
you like

571
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,679
i'm i'm not so sure what's going on and

572
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,559
um

573
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,600
i feel like there are at least at least

574
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,240
a few of those

575
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,520
institutional ais which are kind of

576
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,679
going wrong

577
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,000
um you know and i don't know if the

578
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,039
trees and the birds will be able

579
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,799
uh to uh calm them down

580
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,480
i don't know like i'm really confused

581
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,200
can you can you give me some suggestion

582
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,200
what should i do

583
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,480
zentai i'm so glad so glad you brought

584
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,360
this to our

585
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,840
end of year um trio because you know

586
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,799
maybe

587
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,799
maybe we could help think about what you

588
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:20,399
know what your goals for this next

589
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:22,158
for 2078 could look like because

590
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,158
you know i'm i am hearing i'm hearing

591
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,000
what you're saying about the kind of

592
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,679
the worries and the concerns that you've

593
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,200
got about the

594
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:34,000
the rogue um ai rhizomes but

595
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,000
you know we we worked so hard to throw

596
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,880
off that institutional

597
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,840
baggage and and kind of programming and

598
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,240
you know just

599
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,279
just thinking about those those decades

600
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,520
of struggle

601
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,320
um where we really had to kind of

602
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,200
introspect

603
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,080
you know into our own psyches and and

604
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,399
look at

605
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,960
you know where where is kind of in

606
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,080
institutional hierarchical colonization

607
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,960
that happened

608
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,840
internally how how to kind of deprogram

609
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,919
that

610
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,158
um so i have to say it it does make me a

611
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:08,799
little bit nervous when i hear

612
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:12,080
um hear of the the urge to bring back

613
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:15,360
some of that codification um

614
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,918
at the same time i can imagine you know

615
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,360
maybe you're right maybe it is dangerous

616
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,320
to have removed

617
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,879
so much of those kind of guide rails and

618
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,520
and

619
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,799
roles and and the ability to to you know

620
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,520
the checks and balances

621
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:32,399
which which were so important i mean

622
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,879
fatokia and boy what do you think

623
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,520
i mean this takes me back to the early

624
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,279
days

625
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:43,520
of the data demons

626
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:47,360
i mean those were really the first ai

627
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:50,000
agents that we were able to

628
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,799
in a sense reclaim back from the

629
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,799
institutional overlords that were

630
00:28:52,799 --> 00:29:00,080
previously orchestrating

631
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,440
these ai rhizomes into manipulative

632
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,158
assemblages

633
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,559
that were as i was sort of referencing

634
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,679
railroading us into their institutional

635
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,000
goals without any real

636
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,840
awareness or attentiveness or care

637
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
towards our individual

638
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,600
or our bio-regional health and

639
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,760
well-being

640
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:26,080
and in the late 2020s early 2030s when

641
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,760
we started to introduce these

642
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,600
data demons that were institutionally

643
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,679
programmed and codified to

644
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,279
work on our behalf and work on behalf of

645
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,440
our local communities and our local

646
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,320
bioregions

647
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,399
it felt so hopeful to be able to

648
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,000
actually take back power

649
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:50,000
over this entire

650
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,880
weaponization of ai back into our

651
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,880
local communities back here in faytopia

652
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,000
we were able to

653
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:01,039
fully gain a handle over

654
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,640
the local economic and social

655
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,200
interrelations based upon the data that

656
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,279
was

657
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,200
being generated by all of our community

658
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,399
and we knew that that wasn't going off

659
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,480
into

660
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:17,039
some larger institutional mechanic that

661
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,399
was ultimately going to be extractive

662
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:21,679
and remove our agency from the decisions

663
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,840
that we were taking on a day-to-day

664
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,240
basis

665
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,399
and so these data demons were really

666
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,919
that first step in

667
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,639
giving us back a semblance of alignment

668
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,440
with

669
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,240
with ai and we've had since then 40

670
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,600
years

671
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:43,360
more of real

672
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:46,559
collaboration and coordination with

673
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,000
all of these technologies of radical

674
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,960
collaboration there

675
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,279
of which ai was a was just a part but we

676
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,919
were

677
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,760
able to use zentai punk you were so key

678
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,760
to this we were able to use

679
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,799
blockchain and distributed ledgers to

680
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,840
really

681
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:04,158
create these these rhizomes that took

682
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,360
into account

683
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,279
our needs and our intentions

684
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,399
and so in thinking now that they're

685
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:16,240
going out of alignment once again it's

686
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:19,518
it's concerning and maybe we didn't

687
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:23,200
fully exercise those

688
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,240
extractive institutional intentions and

689
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,760
tendencies

690
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,320
and maybe they're coming back in once

691
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:32,320
again or maybe i'm just biased

692
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,559
against that oppressive

693
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,000
regime that we we managed to get

694
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,240
ourselves out of

695
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,760
but well you know you know what i think

696
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,600
is like i mean we've seen it

697
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,799
we've seen it like in the past we've

698
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,000
seen how

699
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:49,200
you know we developed those ais that

700
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,240
you know really supported us and

701
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:56,480
um you know and facilitated

702
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,559
our task and uh you know enabled us to

703
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,600
assess so much more information that we

704
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,879
would have been able to do by human

705
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,360
and there was like this kind of

706
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,480
symbiotic relationship for a while

707
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,889
and then somehow the ai went too far and

708
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,159
um

709
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,440
[Music]

710
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:16,480
and uh kind of like overcome

711
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,200
our own interests for its own and you

712
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,200
know like

713
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,480
i was i remember like how happy i was

714
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,080
like the first

715
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,919
when we had the first communication

716
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,559
between the ai and the trees

717
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,399
and i was like wow this is really this

718
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,158
is really it like we really figured it

719
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,080
out we never have to worry

720
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,279
about governance again because obviously

721
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,320
the wisdom of the trees and the plants

722
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,080
will really will really help us actually

723
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,000
understand how to govern ourselves and

724
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,080
the fact that ais can actually

725
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,240
speak to those creatures is just so

726
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,760
revolutionary

727
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:52,559
and uh and and seeing the ais

728
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,279
learn and develop themselves with the

729
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,840
insights

730
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,720
of the trees it was i mean it was like i

731
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,918
think the best

732
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,080
years of my life and you know uh

733
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,840
it's been now like uh it's been about

734
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,439
like 50 years that uh

735
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:10,720
that they are being trained on on three

736
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,480
insights and wisdom and somehow i'm

737
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,279
starting to see it's very early it's

738
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,600
really early so

739
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,960
i might be wrong i don't know but i'm

740
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,840
starting to see

741
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,960
the ai kind of moving further like

742
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,080
taking on their own

743
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,080
route and just like going further to to

744
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,600
where the plants would ever go you know

745
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,480
and it's always these

746
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,879
this extremism and and i think the ai

747
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,519
just has this tendency of

748
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,120
learning and excelling and excelling to

749
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,399
the point that it reached such an

750
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,760
extreme

751
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:44,479
that just blow up

752
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,080
and so i'm just hearing where whether

753
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,120
the rhizomatic

754
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,439
uh mechanism which is this unbolding and

755
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,678
evolving and revolving

756
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,480
and which is working so well for

757
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,120
learning but

758
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,760
didn't we reach a point in which the

759
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,279
learning

760
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,960
is becoming exponential and uh it's not

761
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,320
learning anymore from the trees it's

762
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,159
learning from itself

763
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,560
and perhaps this is where we might need

764
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,919
some some scaffoldings

765
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,799
and some constraints just so that the ai

766
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,199
stays

767
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,960
in line with the trees as opposed to

768
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,319
getting into its own loop

769
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,760
you know what i mean so that's kind of

770
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,480
what i'm thinking i'm wondering like it

771
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,240
says like

772
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,760
it's very i understand completely your

773
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,239
concern like i don't want

774
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,159
myself to even think about bringing back

775
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,719
some institutions here

776
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,480
but um but i'm just wondering like of

777
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:35,118
course sania is not afraid you know

778
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,560
we cannot pretend uh they understand

779
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,560
each other they can communicate with

780
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,719
each other but they are not the same

781
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:45,599
and so do we need to do we need to just

782
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,959
let them and see where it goes or do we

783
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,560
want to put some

784
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,960
and and the point is that i would like

785
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,759
the trees to answer that question

786
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,918
but of course the ai will not will not

787
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,480
communicate will not translate

788
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,078
the the answer if the answer was that we

789
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,720
had to add the scaffolding to them you

790
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,400
know and so

791
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,799
can we really trust the ai to

792
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,880
communicate to the trees and to tell

793
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,800
is the true like i feel like we're kind

794
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,960
of uh we're kind of like

795
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,800
in this real situation because we cannot

796
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,280
speak to the tree by ourselves we need

797
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,480
to go

798
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,119
via the ai but if they were to

799
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,720
disagree with the ai will the ai tell us

800
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,240
i don't know

801
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,040
celebrant girl maybe the mycelium can

802
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,799
help

803
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,599
i know you've been working for a long

804
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,800
time on mycelial organization

805
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:36,079
uh half a century even uh

806
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:40,079
is there a role do you think for

807
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,079
for support from the mycelium

808
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,800
well the mycelial interfaces could

809
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,839
actually come in quite helpful here

810
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,480
and you know as we know they facilitate

811
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,119
the

812
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,359
communication you know they're such

813
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,640
loyal servants in a sense i mean

814
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:58,720
symbiotic

815
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:01,040
servants um to the trees and i

816
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,720
you know latest latest research shows

817
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,680
that the relations between

818
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,000
the ais and the mycelium are quite good

819
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:11,520
you know they seem to

820
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
they seem to um cognite

821
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,040
in similar ways so i do i do feel like

822
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,880
that's a really good

823
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,800
point you know maybe this is maybe this

824
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,920
is a place to bring in

825
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,640
those mycelial um

826
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,359
apis and and allow you know maybe there

827
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,240
needs to be

828
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,640
just like you know we learn early on in

829
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,240
in

830
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,920
school you know in conflict resolution

831
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,560
maybe there needs to be a third party

832
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,079
maybe there needs to be a mycelial actor

833
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,440
to to help facilitate

834
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:42,320
um what sounds like it could become

835
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,920
quite a tricky uh breakdown in

836
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,480
communication

837
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,440
but i also was as you were speaking

838
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,560
zentai

839
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,200
um you know i have been

840
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,720
engaging in in somewhat esoteric

841
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,759
thoughts recently

842
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,279
um about the role of humans in in these

843
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,760
interactions i mean

844
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,400
you know maybe it's a little bit a

845
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,599
little bit

846
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,960
um out there but you know we've

847
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:11,760
we've so we've so significantly removed

848
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,359
the role of the human being in these

849
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,640
governance decisions

850
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:20,560
and really kind of um yeah

851
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:23,839
just given over um

852
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,560
the power to to these more than human

853
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,480
beings and agents but is is there

854
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,520
something you know is there a role for

855
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,240
for the human being in these in these

856
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,000
you know decisions i think i would be

857
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,839
having more concern to reintroduce

858
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,079
the humans then i would be concerned of

859
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:43,279
introducing the institutions

860
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,960
you know and and i i wonder like is it

861
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,040
is it uh it's like it's always this

862
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,880
thing we never we never know is like

863
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,560
things from the past can can the longer

864
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,599
be tested but

865
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,000
i always have this like weird debate you

866
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,359
know

867
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,960
with uh with the various um the various

868
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,680
creatures around

869
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,119
about whether is it like is it the

870
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,879
institution that

871
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,880
corrupted the humans obviously the

872
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,520
humans that corrupted the institutions

873
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,520
and

874
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,040
we never know we just we decided to get

875
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,400
rid of both of them

876
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:17,680
um at least in our governance structures

877
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:21,040
but um you know i think it's very risky

878
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,399
to to like yeah i don't know it's so

879
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,079
hard like

880
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,920
i really wonder do you think like if we

881
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,839
if we start adding institutions

882
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,520
again we might actually corrupt the

883
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,078
trees as well i don't know that would be

884
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,240
like

885
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,480
the end because then we really

886
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,040
only have the ai to rely upon

887
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,160
obviously that maybe now that we

888
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,640
actually

889
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,799
got rid of the institution we could

890
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,640
slowly reintroduce humans into the

891
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,800
governance structures

892
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:52,879
uh this is like this is a billion

893
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,880
billion bitcoins question

894
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:02,000
yeah it's tough tough decisions

895
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,800
it's like it's a very high risk thing

896
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,359
and like

897
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,839
is the gain worth the risk i really

898
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,759
don't know

899
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:10,078
i'm very cool is that maybe we could do

900
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,320
like a very small experiment

901
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,599
and uh just reintroduce them into like a

902
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,920
very small

903
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,760
subset uh so what you're saying

904
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,320
basically if i understand correctly is

905
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,560
that

906
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:24,240
you would rather have as

907
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,799
incorporate some human uh into the

908
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,399
debate

909
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:32,000
than having having us

910
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,400
produce some institutional scaffolding

911
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,160
that's right just human beings no

912
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,880
institutions no roles

913
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,759
no you know none of that just human

914
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,760
beings and

915
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,800
there have been some early experiments

916
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,720
in new zealand

917
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,240
that have been showing some some

918
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,078
promising results i know it's a

919
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,759
completely different

920
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,000
situation there because they were so far

921
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,119
ahead of the rest of the world even back

922
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,040
in the kind of 20s and 30s but

923
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,400
and it might be the influence of the the

924
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,560
maori people there

925
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,000
um there could be stuff to learn there

926
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,119
you know not all

927
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,760
not all humans um have been

928
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:09,440
have been behaving the same way through

929
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,599
or through all of this

930
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,720
that's a really great point i think the

931
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,520
the way that

932
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:20,959
they were back then able to reintroduce

933
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:24,400
uh the the notion of the rhizome uh

934
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,480
as a sort of interface for how humans

935
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,319
can work with nature i think is

936
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,200
fascinating so that it wasn't

937
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,839
humans acting as humans but really

938
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,000
humans

939
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,520
being a part of this larger assemblage

940
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,560
of humans

941
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:41,440
and nature and

942
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,040
data driven ai they had their data

943
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,640
commons

944
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,040
i think it was established in the early

945
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,440
2020s that was really

946
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,279
influential in bringing school children

947
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,119
and

948
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,599
non-profit civic organizations and the

949
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,079
the maori tribal organizations together

950
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,560
into this rhizomatic assemblage

951
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,880
of intention and i think in that kind of

952
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,400
configuration if we can hop back to that

953
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,400
sort of

954
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,160
approach to bringing the human voice

955
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,440
back into governance

956
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:16,399
maybe we can have a sort of a more

957
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:19,280
mycelial uh representation of humanity

958
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,480
uh in this dialogue and conversation

959
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,480
between ai and nature and so

960
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,240
if once upon a time we were looking to

961
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,280
nature or ai to help us

962
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,118
mediate our relations with other

963
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,480
non-human actors

964
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,440
maybe the time has come for humans to

965
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,079
adopt that mediatory function again but

966
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,599
not

967
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:44,000
as the prime mover but much more in that

968
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:48,640
maori tradition of being

969
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,560
one part of a larger assemblage

970
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,640
i have to tell you i'm i'm i have a

971
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,839
little bit of um

972
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,279
um i'm a bit i have a little bit of a

973
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:59,440
version to that

974
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,440
maybe we can think maybe instead of

975
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,520
humans because like

976
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,640
you know the problem of humans and their

977
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,280
identities

978
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,598
understated and all this stuff was like

979
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,960
i think like the problem is that

980
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:15,119
the event we got rid of institutions we

981
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,480
didn't fully get rid of

982
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,640
identities and eagles uh and so

983
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,720
you know we have dynamics my emerge

984
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,759
again maybe we should um

985
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,160
i don't wanna sound uh self-centered

986
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,640
here

987
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,520
of course but maybe instead of humans we

988
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,560
should actually

989
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:34,480
only allow zentai to to join into the

990
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,599
governance because at least

991
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:40,640
we just eliminate all this uh

992
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:43,680
egocentric identity layer of

993
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,480
humanity and uh and we can just focus on

994
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,118
the actual

995
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,640
uh um level playing field of ideas

996
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,880
uh how do you why would you feel about

997
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,879
that

998
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,359
it's been a while since we we thought

999
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:02,240
about the

1000
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:05,920
zentai characteristics that

1001
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:09,118
elevate humanity into this plane of

1002
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:13,359
fairness and equality can you

1003
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:15,440
can you just re-read

1004
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,400
go over that again for a sentai punk as

1005
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,359
to why

1006
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,040
that is unique because i remember but i

1007
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,240
just want a reintroduction if that's

1008
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,480
okay

1009
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,720
i mean of course you know like i mean

1010
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,240
basically we have we have seen it

1011
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,279
over the past thousands years there's

1012
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,720
like

1013
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,520
humans somehow they they just have this

1014
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,118
like

1015
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,200
and we don't know again we don't know if

1016
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,319
it's inerrant or what but they still

1017
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,279
have it like

1018
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,240
whenever they can see things that can

1019
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,640
distinguish

1020
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,799
themselves from others then they grab it

1021
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:51,359
as a construction of stages

1022
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,000
there's like this obsession that humans

1023
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,799
have about

1024
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,680
building status which is this most

1025
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,319
abstract

1026
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,919
and meaningless thing that has ever been

1027
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:02,000
created by society

1028
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,119
and yet they just grab it and whenever

1029
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,160
they see

1030
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,319
something they just grab it in order to

1031
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,440
identify themselves as different from

1032
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,000
others as this

1033
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,720
this very egocentric thing and and i

1034
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,160
think

1035
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,118
you know our society of course has

1036
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,160
contributed a lot to removing this ego

1037
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,839
but it's still

1038
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,399
it's still you know it's it's an

1039
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,920
evolutionary trait that needs to delude

1040
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,079
itself over time

1041
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,599
and so with the zentai of course we're

1042
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:31,440
just trying to

1043
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,319
help evolution and uh while we as humans

1044
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,880
still

1045
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,480
have distinctive characteristics then we

1046
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,000
just try to cover them we

1047
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,720
we cover them we try to we try to hide

1048
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,640
all our distinctiveness so that we all

1049
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,598
become the same and so that

1050
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,359
eventual and then totally steal the ego

1051
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,839
we hide the hiccup we suffocate the

1052
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,119
either

1053
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:55,440
ego and another suits and again everyone

1054
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,880
then becomes the same and there is this

1055
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,359
field of equality

1056
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,119
and this is kind of like we're trying

1057
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:03,680
culturally we're trying to use those

1058
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,319
materiality and those tools in order to

1059
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,359
help

1060
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:11,000
the mind get let go of

1061
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:13,759
all those intrinsic desires of

1062
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,079
egocentricity um and it has been working

1063
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,760
very well i mean we see how

1064
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,119
this the human society has really

1065
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,920
evolved ever since we

1066
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,800
we cover ourselves with the sentai suits

1067
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,359
um

1068
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,760
so i'm just wondering like i think that

1069
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:30,160
at least the humans that have been

1070
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,119
uh training these muscles you know it's

1071
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,799
kind of like

1072
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,400
it's like in the past we had like the

1073
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,000
monks you know the buddhist monk that

1074
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,720
were training their mind

1075
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,640
at letting off the ego and uh now we

1076
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,560
just have one extra tool which is like

1077
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,000
like a physical and material tool in

1078
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,040
order to further

1079
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,800
let go of the ego um so i think like

1080
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,720
the zen ties have really been training

1081
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,160
themselves a lot and maybe

1082
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:57,598
they are more likely to to be

1083
00:45:54,160 --> 00:46:01,118
um to be less

1084
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:04,480
uh less less likely to be corrupted with

1085
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:07,680
again this egocentric desire of power

1086
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,319
and stages uh as soon as we incorporate

1087
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,759
them into

1088
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:14,480
a governance high zone i'm so glad you

1089
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:17,520
brought that all back it's

1090
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:21,040
so easy to forget sometimes that

1091
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:23,119
deliberation and politics was seen as

1092
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,000
some sort of dirty

1093
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,119
uh concept and that technology could fix

1094
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,839
everything

1095
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,440
and it's thanks to the zentai and the

1096
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:33,279
punks in general solar punch and

1097
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:37,359
anti-punks that we were

1098
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:40,560
able to recognize how important politics

1099
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:42,560
and power actually were to

1100
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,839
bringing us here today and the

1101
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,200
deliberation

1102
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:50,480
that was liberated from the

1103
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,799
bane of status and role the deliberation

1104
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,680
that could truly be based on

1105
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,040
ideas for what they were worth in and of

1106
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,480
themselves

1107
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,400
it's so easy to forget how important

1108
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,440
that was and i think you're right zentai

1109
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,640
punk we

1110
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:07,440
we should bring that back again that's

1111
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,319
it's really important yeah i think the

1112
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,280
zentai

1113
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:12,880
delegate councils are probably the best

1114
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,560
you know the best i've seen of

1115
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:19,760
of truly um truly deliberative and

1116
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,319
and egoless decision making on behalf of

1117
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,079
all

1118
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,800
all beings and you know i won't go into

1119
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,400
the

1120
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,319
i don't think we've we've got time to

1121
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,800
talk about the kind of risks of

1122
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:31,520
anonymity because you know corruption is

1123
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,599
still

1124
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:36,400
amongst us it's still real even after

1125
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:39,680
all these years of decades of

1126
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:42,720
trying to um

1127
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:45,040
yeah push that out of our society but

1128
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,520
you know i think if anyone can if we can

1129
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:52,000
trust anyone it's probably the zen ties

1130
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:54,079
with their training um

1131
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,440
we've only got a couple more minutes

1132
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,800
left before we've got to go

1133
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:01,680
for a bacterial council um

1134
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,559
wondering how we want to close out this

1135
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:07,839
meeting

1136
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,839
as we look forward to the next year

1137
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,279
maybe you could give us a little heads

1138
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:16,480
up on the the councils that we have

1139
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,839
upcoming uh moral imagination has been

1140
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,119
such a

1141
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:25,359
critical part of our ability to

1142
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:29,359
engage in councils uh i'm excited

1143
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:31,359
to think about the the ways in which

1144
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:32,799
you have been gathering these councils

1145
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:34,799
silicon girl and maybe you could just

1146
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,480
give us a little heads up on what's

1147
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,559
coming up next with these with these

1148
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,119
different councils that encompass moral

1149
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:43,680
imagination

1150
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,440
yeah i mean the next few days are quite

1151
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,319
packed but obviously the start of the

1152
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,400
year is a

1153
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:50,079
you know really important time for for

1154
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,480
these councils and

1155
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,119
i'm particularly excited about the lycan

1156
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,200
council

1157
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,760
so obviously that's you know that that's

1158
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,480
really bringing our imagination in a

1159
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,760
whole

1160
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,319
new kind of symbiotic form of you know

1161
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,200
fungi

1162
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:06,000
and algae so my interest you know back

1163
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,799
in

1164
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,319
back in the 20s and 30s was you know far

1165
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,720
wider in terms of

1166
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,599
councils of all beings and you know

1167
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,799
really just

1168
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,680
including uh all all beings from the

1169
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,880
night sky

1170
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,078
to the to the you know to mountains to

1171
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,359
trees to

1172
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,839
to dolphins and and and more but

1173
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:29,440
i think now you know i'm becoming more

1174
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:32,480
and more interested in those

1175
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,359
symbiotic councils that really allow us

1176
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,800
to

1177
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:39,520
deeply embody and and

1178
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:42,240
understand symbiosis as a as an

1179
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,599
organizing force

1180
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,720
and you know that's what makes me

1181
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:49,680
hopeful about the the ai and tree

1182
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:52,160
interface if we can really learn from

1183
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,839
the the pattern of symbiosis

1184
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,399
um i think there's something there and

1185
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:58,960
if we use our moral imagination to

1186
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,040
to better understand that and take that

1187
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,160
on and maybe we can be programming more

1188
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:06,640
