1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:09,300
[Music]

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:13,920
[Applause]

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,519
[Laughter]

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,119
hello everybody my name is wasim

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,520
al-sindi and i'm the janitor

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,800
an organization called the xerox salon

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,000
and uh today

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,039
uh eugenio and the um solar punk

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,119
rc3 crowd currently invited me to

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,160
talk a little bit about the latest state

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,238
of some

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,440
work in progress research around the new

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,800
topic for the salon

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,559
that we're calling the indifference

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,919
engine and uh the

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,078
um purpose of this is to work towards an

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,680
ecological characterization of bitcoin

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,320
so we will without any further ado

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,600
roll straight in and so uh this is what

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,199
we're going to talk about today

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,879
um and you know hopefully some of these

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,839
things will make a bit more sense as we

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,320
uh go on so to phrase a coin we all know

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,120
about

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,640
the difference engine right babbage

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,479
lovelace

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:08,000
um and so on but

28
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,000
why indifference and so uh to

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,520
exemplify this i've taken a quotation

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,400
from a recent

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,360
poem by a collective offshoot of the

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,720
xerox salon

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,720
called the cryptographic poetic

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,640
researchers union the cpru

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,320
and i'll read it to you now so fractals

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,400
don't care about your feelings

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,000
systems disregard their externalities

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,119
and formalisms cannot reason about

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,880
the real and so here's the kicker aside

40
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,320
from a single very course

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,158
a feedback mechanism that's called the

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,720
difficulty adjustment algorithm

43
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,720
bitcoin is essentially insensate it

44
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,439
cannot care about what happens outside

45
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,720
of its

46
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,880
borders outside of its environs

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,720
only that the piper is paid and played

48
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,399
in this way that we call them economics

49
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,679
which we'll get to a bit later

50
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,240
and so here's the tldr the bitcoin

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,600
pits capital ecology against each other

52
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,759
in a prisoner's dilemma

53
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,600
style paradox that could tip the balance

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,560
in favor of a hot house earth

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,079
and so this is very hard for me to say

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,280
because i was one of the people banging

57
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,478
the drum for bitcoin for

58
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,080
many years seven years or so um

59
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,680
and uh i will explain to you and

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,360
hopefully impress upon you that there is

61
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,560
a value and worth to bitcoin

62
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,560
and there isn't a need for uncensorable

63
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,760
ungoverned means of digital value

64
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,640
transfer but

65
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,679
the cost that we might have to pay to

66
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,440
keep bitcoin running

67
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,040
is arguably too great for this planet to

68
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,200
bear okay

69
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,280
so let's talk a bit about motivations

70
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,200
and so as i said i'm a janitor at this

71
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,040
loose collective organization called the

72
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,280
xerox salon we don't really know what it

73
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,799
is yet but we're thinking of it as this

74
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,400
uh tentacular um post-disciplinary

75
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,360
assemblage of entangled concepts and

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,720
methodologies

77
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,480
so we are an informal research

78
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,760
collective approaching unusual

79
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,280
topics um and trying to break down

80
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,640
epistemic boundaries bringing people

81
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,319
from all kinds of different

82
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,119
places and creating an informal space

83
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,399
for unstructured discussions

84
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,319
to explore unusual topics and we are

85
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,920
holding discourse events the salons

86
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,679
themselves we are writing we're

87
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,440
producing artistic outputs

88
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,040
and one of the uh interesting things so

89
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,040
being the sounds based

90
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,120
trust this multi-disciplinary workspace

91
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,799
in berlin and the interesting um

92
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,239
thing is that many of our salon and

93
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,599
trust colleagues have actually worked

94
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,879
very closely with bitcoin

95
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,959
cryptocurrencies and blockchain

96
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,560
technology for many years and uh there

97
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,440
are quite a few tells to tell and so

98
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,640
there's a magic

99
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,560
car there's some kind of art piece

100
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,760
behind me on the screen and let me

101
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,879
read you a little bit more from one of

102
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,440
these poems accumulationism as a mode of

103
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,959
being

104
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,879
the decentralized death drive is

105
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,799
indifferent to your plight nagasaki

106
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,239
sunrise for all eternity

107
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,000
now those are pretty strong words so

108
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,440
let's see if there's uh some

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,519
someone's got something to back them up

110
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,599
with so there's this thing called

111
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,239
bitcoin you might have heard of it

112
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,920
it's a cryptocurrency it's a network of

113
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,799
computers that speak the same language a

114
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,798
protocol

115
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,280
and through the implementation of this

116
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,360
protocol a series of

117
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,439
machinic and algorithmic processes take

118
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,959
place which lead to the creation and

119
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,200
redistribution of these

120
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,159
um cryptographic abstractions of value

121
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,839
that people call

122
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,280
tokens or coins excuse me and so the

123
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,760
graph that you see on the screen

124
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,280
is what's called the hash rate this is

125
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,560
an indirect proxy

126
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,040
of the measurement of the amount of

127
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,079
energy going into bitcoin to defend it

128
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,519
to keep the um the the sanctity of the

129
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,840
transaction history

130
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,440
um maintained so bitcoin's this

131
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,479
extremely defensive network

132
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,280
that requires this constant uh input of

133
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,199
energy uh for uh security reasons for

134
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,719
coin distribution reasons and also

135
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,720
uh because it has no way of generating

136
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,800
randomness uh internal to it

137
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,160
and so uh you know what do we what

138
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,080
should we make about all this bitcoin

139
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,240
stuff so like we all heard about bitcoin

140
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,680
uh you know a few years ago people were

141
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,639
stopped talking about it and it kind of

142
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,080
went away

143
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,680
now it seems to be back so we are

144
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,479
hitting all-time highs in terms of the

145
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,919
price

146
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,520
uh last time i checked the price is

147
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,880
around twenty seven thousand dollars

148
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,280
which gives bitcoin a

149
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,560
nominal value of the network as a

150
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,840
nominal value all the tokens put

151
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,440
together of approximately half a

152
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,719
trillion dollars so that is quite a lot

153
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,440
of money

154
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,039
okay and so here is uh the first of a

155
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,960
series of provocations

156
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,759
uh around the indifference engine and

157
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,198
i'll read you the quotation again from

158
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,960
the cryptographic poetics researchers

159
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,400
union on the card

160
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,960
the elephant in the room grows less

161
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,799
restless as the air fills with soot

162
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,799
some cheer it on as others choke and

163
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,120
weeds the temperature rises again

164
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,160
and so this graph is we're watching the

165
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,759
temperature rise

166
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,440
just as when you look at the price of

167
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,960
bitcoin that chart as

168
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,039
every time you see a green candle and

169
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,440
the price goes up the beast gets

170
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,800
thirstier wants more energy to defend it

171
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,360
because the honeypot

172
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,639
that this network is defending um it

173
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,120
grows larger this is actually the

174
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,120
biggest

175
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,240
computing honeypot and biggest monetary

176
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,600
honeypot on the planet

177
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,080
at half a trillion dollars if you could

178
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,120
hack this thing say with a quantum

179
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,000
computer on some

180
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,520
pre-quantum signature schemes then um

181
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,199
you know this thing would lose all of

182
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,359
this

183
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,759
um a perceived value

184
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,800
okay so uh here's a provocation that we

185
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,400
wrote over that we're

186
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,000
drafting we're in the middle of writing

187
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,560
for bitcoin and you can see that bitcoin

188
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,919
here is pictured as a black hole as a

189
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,919
naked singularity

190
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,359
uh something with a hard boundary uh

191
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,599
beyond which we cannot

192
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,680
uh a reason beyond and there's a reason

193
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,360
why we've uh used that analogy and we'll

194
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,039
come back to that bit later in fact even

195
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,960
bitcoin is quite proud of this analogy

196
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,240
for other reasons

197
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,919
so let me read to you what's on the

198
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,120
what's on the screen as bitcoin

199
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,719
surpasses previous

200
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,919
price records and re-enters mainstream

201
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,039
consciousness following several

202
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,719
wilderness years

203
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,880
the 12-year cryptocurrency appears to

204
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,880
have arrived in the eyes of the market

205
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,400
the value proposition of an ungoverned

206
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,159
unsensual digital means of value

207
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,359
transfer is clear for all to see

208
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,440
but can our planet afford the

209
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,880
thermodynamic price tag

210
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,800
to maintain the integrity of the

211
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,639
transaction record the bitcoin network

212
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,880
creates a hard boundary to the outside

213
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,800
through exacting validation requirements

214
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,639
there is no sensitivity to the

215
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,560
consequences of the thermoeconomic

216
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,919
challenges it issues

217
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,680
this inability of mined cryptocurrencies

218
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,758
to differentiate the energy sources used

219
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,039
to secure them has led to criticism as

220
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,880
to their indifference

221
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,880
to their ecological externalities

222
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,240
and so this is where the indifference

223
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,960
engine is coming from like

224
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,800
bitcoin can't care about what happens

225
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,198
outside it just like a black hole can't

226
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,400
care

227
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,199
it just wants to suck mata uh you know

228
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,318
um mata energy let's say in the

229
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,800
einsteinian sense

230
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,400
out of the external environment and

231
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,639
that's kind of what bitcoin is doing

232
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,599
so we'll take a little break and we'll

233
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,599
look at a meme on the screen

234
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,599
and so you may have heard about this

235
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,159
movement called decentralized finance or

236
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,919
defy

237
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,080
it's all the rage at the moment uh

238
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,878
particularly in some parts of the crypto

239
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,199
blockchain space and really what i see

240
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,199
here

241
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,120
is a great deal of the replication of

242
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,680
the systemic fragilities and problems of

243
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,960
the traditional financial system

244
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,039
being built atop some very experimental

245
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,359
and

246
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:03,440
untested foundations and so um

247
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,199
there's no uh surprise when i see these

248
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,440
projects failing and collapsing

249
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,599
on a daily basis so this is a house of

250
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,639
money cards territory if you ask me

251
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,280
in the middle we have the internet of

252
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:17,199
value which is a more kind of um

253
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,638
neutral um platitude that's quite

254
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,160
inclusive and welcoming of bitcoin and

255
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,680
all the other cryptocurrencies

256
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,440
uh thinking that we can make a kind of a

257
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,840
network society for these different

258
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,120
uh coins and that sounds great but the

259
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,560
problem is that all these things have

260
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,120
for humans around them like

261
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,240
tribes or or ideologies and you know

262
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,519
what humans are like when they have

263
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,760
ideologies

264
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,440
and so but the apotheosis of this meme

265
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,319
really is the black hole of money and i

266
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,560
think this is

267
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,839
like what bitcoin is bitcoin is quite

268
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,279
proud of calling it the black hole of

269
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,160
money because they see that

270
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,160
as a way of stripping away the impure

271
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,839
the central banking and the fear

272
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,480
uh from um humanity and from from earth

273
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,399
but as a card carrying uh a physicist

274
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,160
who started his scientific career

275
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,839
and the oldest research astronomical

276
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,480
research observatory in the world

277
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,560
i would caution people at hoping that

278
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,519
their thing is a black hole you may

279
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,640
not want what that entails in reality

280
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,560
and so um

281
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,839
we had this funny conversation at trust

282
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,599
and myself when a colleague joined a

283
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,000
pope where we were talking about

284
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,519
systems that barely work and we had the

285
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,519
joke that we would like to set up

286
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,880
the barely working systems working group

287
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,360
and so if anybody would like to join

288
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,640
that

289
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,399
then let us know and i guess we'll have

290
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,920
to start it and figure out what we do

291
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,519
but the point i want to make here is

292
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,680
that bitcoin is kind of this

293
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,120
clutchy solutions highly suboptimal

294
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,719
solution

295
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,320
if you look at the component level

296
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
almost every piece of it from the kind

297
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,959
of

298
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,320
the networking from the economics from

299
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,959
the cryptography

300
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,959
and from the distributed systems um

301
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,160
these are all very sub-optimizing even

302
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,319
the governance as well these are all

303
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,399
very sub-optimal individual solutions

304
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,600
so it's a paradise for mousetrap

305
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,279
designers like if you're

306
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,720
an academic a professor a protocol

307
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,519
designer you'll look at something in

308
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,920
bitcoin and think

309
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,120
that sucks i can do it better here's my

310
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,599
new mousetrap

311
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,600
and obviously with um everything outside

312
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,680
of bitcoin people can make their own

313
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,040
tokens and cryptocurrencies and networks

314
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,959
you can print your own money

315
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,319
and so if you can build a better

316
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,959
mousetrap and you can print your own

317
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,000
money

318
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,359
you can see that there might be some

319
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,360
incentives for you know

320
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,640
grifters and all the rest of it um but

321
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,880
one of the points i wanted to make here

322
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,279
that i i skipped over earlier is that

323
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,200
um bitcoin even though it looks highly

324
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,480
suboptimal it's very resilient

325
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,240
bitcoin is a cockroach it's the

326
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,680
cockroach of money just as emails the

327
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,480
cockroach of communication

328
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,279
and i think with quite a high degree of

329
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,880
certainty

330
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,480
if there was a nuclear fallout and a

331
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,959
kind of apocalyptic

332
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,800
um happening on this planet and bitcoin

333
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,160
would be one of the first um

334
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,399
global networks that would get back up

335
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,640
and running at first in localized areas

336
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,240
as

337
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,760
computers start to connect to each other

338
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,880
and then as the linkages are made by

339
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,680
whatever satellite

340
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,320
homing pigeon a smoke signal who knows

341
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,040
uh i i think things would carry on

342
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,800
anyway moving on and so some people

343
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,399
describe bitcoin as the impenetrable

344
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,000
fortress of validation

345
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,000
and they mean that in a good way that

346
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,440
means it's very hard to cheat the system

347
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,360
there are no rulers but there's a

348
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,360
great deal of very stringent rules and

349
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,800
so transactions are checked to be valid

350
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,120
before they enter the permanent record

351
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,079
in a block and then as a minor creates a

352
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,839
block

353
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,519
um and attempts to claim the reward the

354
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,680
incentive economics incentive

355
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,640
the lottery incentive uh that is checked

356
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,160
by all of the other

357
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,079
participants on the network to make sure

358
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,360
no rules have been broken no shortcuts

359
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,120
have been taken

360
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,880
and no improprietary impropriety

361
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,800
has been has been occurring now of

362
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,880
course when you have a set of rules

363
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,560
you can still do some finagling

364
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,760
underneath the surface whilst you

365
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,040
um pay heed and lip service to the rules

366
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,360
but one of the points i want to make

367
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,160
here is that this very hard boundary

368
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,120
creates a hard delineation between the

369
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,040
inside of bitcoin

370
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,040
and the outside in a cryptographic and

371
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,599
computing sense in a networking sense

372
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,880
system sense but i think i would posit

373
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,320
that this also

374
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,320
creates um like an economic penumbra

375
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,839
of this hard boundary and a

376
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,760
socio-political one as well

377
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,600
and we end up with these scorched earth

378
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,560
mindsets we have scorched earth

379
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,880
economics

380
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,760
this uh economic double jeopardy that

381
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,839
we'll talk to

382
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,279
talk about a bit later we have this

383
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,880
scorched earth discourse

384
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,560
log on to bitcoin twitter if you don't

385
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,000
know what i mean and we have this

386
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,839
scorched earth governance and we'll get

387
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,839
to all of these things in a moment

388
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,600
and they lead to this insularity of code

389
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,760
in mind which we're going to give a name

390
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,760
to in a moment

391
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,120
and you know so we all can see the value

392
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
of having a stateless currency with no

393
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,800
rulers

394
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,720
you know there's no um plutarch or

395
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,160
oligarch or overlord

396
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,160
and telling you what you can and can't

397
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,439
spend on like you know spending should

398
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,560
be a form of speech right

399
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,720
if you can say what you want you should

400
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,638
be able to spend how you want um

401
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,000
but even though there's no rulers we

402
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,079
still end up with

403
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,600
tolls and toll keepers trolls and grifts

404
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,680
a lot and a lot i mean there's no

405
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,200
permission to

406
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,719
start any of these things so that a lot

407
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,920
of people have ended up in this space

408
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,560
doing that kind of stuff

409
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,399
it's all quite unpalatable and so one of

410
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,119
the things i would like to posit

411
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,160
is that bitcoin is a form are possibly

412
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,320
the first form

413
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,439
of an algorithmic materialism so it's

414
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,079
using the

415
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,040
um algorithmics of the thermoeconomics

416
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,680
as the incentive

417
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,360
and the algorithmics of the um proof of

418
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,519
work of the cryptocurrency mining

419
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,279
and combining these things together and

420
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,720
the real and the virtual

421
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,040
to create this um synthetic

422
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,279
uh abstraction that straddles the real

423
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,560
and the virtual which is the currency

424
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,399
the cryptocurrency itself

425
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,000
so i really i would argue that it's um

426
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,519
algorithmic materialism

427
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,760
and uh we'll go even further with that

428
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,839
in a moment

429
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,439
so here's another poetic interlude and

430
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,680
i'll just take a water break before we

431
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,680
start

432
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,000
again from the cpiu a black hole greater

433
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,160
than the sum of its parts

434
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,760
the ultraviolet catastrophe of money

435
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,959
rugged individuality meets naked

436
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,120
singularity

437
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,079
thermoeconomic double jeopardy a game of

438
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,880
russian roulette

439
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,359
with alice bob sybil and sock puppets

440
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,959
and that's

441
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,440
also by the um alias satoshi webbed

442
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,119
and so thermoeconomics let's talk a bit

443
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,680
about that what does that word even mean

444
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,880
well here's a recent uh usage of it by a

445
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,920
couple of salon colleagues

446
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,680
in a recent explainer for um

447
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,839
cryptocurrency mining is quite relevant

448
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,839
today

449
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,439
cryptocurrency mining is a

450
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,440
thermoeconomic process employing proof

451
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,279
of work and a parameterizable feedback

452
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,360
mechanism the difficulty adjustment we

453
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,519
mentioned earlier with direct incentives

454
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,199
provided by block rewards

455
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,639
from an algorithmically regulated

456
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,240
network level issuance schedule

457
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,959
alongside transaction fees

458
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,320
and the picture here is from my politico

459
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,599
and these are

460
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,320
um engines uh

461
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,040
natural gas powered engines that are

462
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,720
fueling

463
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:53,439
um bitcoin miners and they sit above

464
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:57,199
um fracking wells in places like um

465
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,399
alberta saskatchewan alaska

466
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,479
so bitcoin doesn't care about where the

467
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,279
energy comes from it just wants energy

468
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,040
doesn't care

469
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,279
how dirty it is it doesn't care if it's

470
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,719
helping it doesn't care if it's harming

471
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,720
in these cases it might actually be

472
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,279
helping believe it or not because a lot

473
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,920
of the

474
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,199
um gas comes with this fractal oil and a

475
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,719
lot of it is just flared off it's

476
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,079
burning and let it into the sky

477
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,639
and your methane going into the

478
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,279
atmosphere that is not good from an

479
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,399
ecological perspective so maybe burning

480
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,839
some of it in this like you know

481
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,120
horrifically inefficient

482
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:30,240
diesel you know did carbon engines

483
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,720
combust combustion engines is a is a

484
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,600
net gain but because i wanted to try to

485
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,040
illustrate the point

486
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,720
that bitcoin doesn't care where the

487
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,000
energy comes from to bitcoin this could

488
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,000
be coming from solar

489
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,040
plant could be coming from nuclear power

490
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,160
could be coming from

491
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:47,279
space uh space harvesting a dyson sphere

492
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,120
it doesn't care and so

493
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,639
this is what we were promised by all

494
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,680
these cryptocurrencies we'll get rid of

495
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,240
the rulers

496
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,959
we'll be able to transact in freedom

497
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,600
we'll have this p2p egalitarian one cpu

498
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,518
one vote

499
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,639
utopia but i think we're actually a bit

500
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,720
closer to this where we started uh the

501
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,320
bosses of the senate the oligarchies and

502
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,600
the plutarchies

503
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,040
i think we're probably a bit closer to

504
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,480
that than we think and we have these

505
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,759
several kind of principal constituents

506
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,440
in the bitcoin network

507
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,880
and one of them is this developer

508
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
technocracy which we'll get to in a

509
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,759
moment

510
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,519
and one of them is this mining illegally

511
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,079
the thermoeconomic cartel

512
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,360
and um both of these things i don't

513
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,800
think they were necessarily anticipated

514
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
by the creators and progenitors of

515
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,120
bitcoin

516
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,440
but those are the reality that we have

517
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,120
to deal with now

518
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,639
and so here's a pyramid we've all seen

519
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,600
pyramids before

520
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,800
i think that most human uh uh

521
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,519
organizations

522
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,519
seem to play out in this way by accident

523
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,320
or by design so you could argue

524
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,160
that at the top of this thing are the um

525
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,440
people that found bitcoin very early

526
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,120
and then you know there's other people

527
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,880
that set up companies that do mining

528
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,160
they're the developers and so on

529
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,480
then there's kind of your media

530
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,959
personalities then you've got kind of

531
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,759
that people like me talking heads kind

532
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,160
of bro

533
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,680
whatever bitcoin bros x bitcoin bros and

534
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,760
then you've got the kind of

535
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,918
followers and the people that watch

536
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,839
bloomberg tell them which coin to buy

537
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,199
and um the people that casually log on

538
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,399
to twitter and have like you know five

539
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,039
followers and things like that

540
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,679
so there is some kind of hierarchy here

541
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,520
and i'm

542
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,799
you know speaking of it because i've

543
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,280
moved through this hierarchy over the

544
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,280
years

545
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,639
and i've also swept floors at some of

546
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,199
the very highest levels

547
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,280
and so when you sweep the floor you hear

548
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,200
interesting things

549
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,399
and so one of the most interesting

550
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
things about all this bitcoin and

551
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,640
blockchain stuff

552
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,679
is that some people see uh bitcoin and

553
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,679
blockchains and and so on as a new

554
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,440
instantiation a new exemplification of a

555
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,160
synthetic time or even a synthetic space

556
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,919
time

557
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,200
and uh for people that are interested in

558
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,280
the philosophical

559
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,640
work of emmanuel khan and everything

560
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,399
that came beyond that

561
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,760
and this is extremely interesting so

562
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,760
this is giving you a

563
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,760
some kind of like a um

564
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,000
a new yardstick a new kind of time that

565
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,480
is divorced from the outside time

566
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,200
and so this is many people think that

567
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,640
this proved

568
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,720
can't write and there's this very

569
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,080
beautiful picture of emoto from

570
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,240
alison's book mushroom at the end of the

571
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,480
world uh called conjuring time

572
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,520
so we will probably litigate the time

573
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,799
thing another another another time

574
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,320
but some of us have been in the

575
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,039
cryptocurrency space have been using

576
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,960
these

577
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:27,679
spatiotemporal thermodynamic and astral

578
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,400
lenses for a number of years here's some

579
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,960
old

580
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,400
tweets by this janitor uh talking about

581
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,760
blockchain's time machines

582
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,919
a couple of years ago all right

583
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,600
meme break so um here's a very

584
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,679
controversial philosopher

585
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,199
on the screen and somebody that is very

586
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,720
interested in bitcoin and

587
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,720
at the blockchain and spaceline

588
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,320
i suppose you could describe bitcoin as

589
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,600
a dark crystal if you were so inclined

590
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,280
and so unfortunately um the nice uh

591
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,719
animated image of cellular automatic

592
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,160
going around the screen here did not

593
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,640
translate but i will just leave you to

594
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,320
imagine

595
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,679
a conway's game of life unfolding in

596
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,760
front of us

597
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,200
and i will say that you know we are at

598
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,080
the salon we have spoken a little bit

599
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,520
about

600
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,879
moving beyond the natural and towards

601
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,080
the synthetic you know what does a

602
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,400
synthetic life form

603
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,559
look like what can it uh do what can it

604
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,919
be how can we tell if something is

605
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,440
alive or not and um the uh

606
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,039
research alexander daisy ginsberg has

607
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,120
done quite a lot of work on this

608
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,160
and this is an interesting speculative

609
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,080
um

610
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:33,280
epistemology of um how a new

611
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,678
you know taxonomic kingdom might exist

612
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,320
uh kind of like a meta state above and

613
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,400
across

614
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,600
transcending the boundaries of other

615
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,240
living

616
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,520
kingdoms and families some people are

617
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,120
starting to work on

618
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,200
uh trying to characterize the behavior

619
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,080
of machines in the similar sense that we

620
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,919
do with uh

621
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,280
human and non-human living things and so

622
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,160
this is like some of my colleagues and

623
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,000
yours

624
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,360
writing some machine behavior paper in

625
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,480
nature and um

626
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,159
i'm going too much into this we've

627
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,760
discussed it at salons before so this is

628
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,799
building on work by tim berg a couple of

629
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,879
generations ago

630
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,799
where we're looking from the individual

631
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,400
to the collective in terms of behavior

632
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,840
and then hybrids of individual

633
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,159
collective behavior and

634
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,199
also hybrids of machine or human and

635
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,640
non-human or

636
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:18,080
natural and non-natural forms of life

637
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,080
whatever they may be and so let's

638
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,678
now look at an interesting example of

639
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,280
somebody trying to

640
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,679
ascribe the agency of life to bitcoin

641
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,440
and so this is uh some work by a fellow

642
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,400
called ralph merkel and he's actually

643
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,360
immortalized

644
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,280
in the bitcoin protocol because every

645
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,639
block of the bitcoin blockchain contains

646
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,280
this thing called merkle tree

647
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,720
which is this hierarchical space-saving

648
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,120
cryptographic construction

649
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,000
which um proves in a quite an efficient

650
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,439
way

651
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,559
how transactions are related to each

652
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,240
other and we need to do that for

653
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,039
validation as i said the bitcoin is a

654
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,559
very strong

655
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,799
uh validation um

656
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,600
engine and this is one of the components

657
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,120
of that engine

658
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,719
so ralph merkel started off as a

659
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,840
cryptographer he's now a chemist and the

660
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,679
chemists are kind of

661
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,120
sitting at the limit of life between

662
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,320
physics and biology

663
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,080
and i say that with a little bit of

664
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,559
experience so having spent a number of

665
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,480
years as a chemist with phd chemistry

666
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,158
so let's read what ralph merkel says

667
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,080
here so bitcoin

668
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,919
is the first example of a new form of

669
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,799
life it lives and breathes on the

670
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,320
internet

671
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,240
it lives because it can pay people to

672
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,760
keep it alive it lives because it

673
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,120
performs a useful service that people

674
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,840
will pay it to perform

675
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,199
it lives because anyone anywhere can run

676
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,879
a copy of its code

677
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,640
it lives because all the running copies

678
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,320
are constantly talking to each other

679
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,080
it lives because if any one copy is

680
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,399
corrupted it is discarded

681
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,600
quickly and without any fuss or loss and

682
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,480
it lives because it's radically

683
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,480
transparent

684
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,760
anyone can see its code and see exactly

685
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,400
what it does

686
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,520
now i think there's plenty of food for

687
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,360
thought in there

688
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,639
but um one of the things i will say

689
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,678
going back to our point about

690
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,760
um bitcoin's uh uh a

691
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,520
very poor sensitivity this feedback

692
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,919
mechanism that it contains

693
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,559
um you could argue that this is kind of

694
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,679
an

695
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,440
adaptive mechanism but it with without a

696
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,640
more sophisticated sensing

697
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,240
it's um uh i don't i don't think it

698
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,320
would qualify meet the bar for

699
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,400
any kind of meaningful definition of

700
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,840
life and one of the other things to say

701
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,640
is that the point that was brought up in

702
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,199
salon by uh our colleague sarah friend

703
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,880
is that

704
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,480
bitcoin has already reproduced itself

705
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,520
through forks and some of us have

706
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,600
written papers about

707
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,600
uh the forks of bitcoin and and what we

708
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,918
might learn from those

709
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,678
but i would say that the this network

710
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,880
partitioning that creates these

711
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:35,200
blockchain forks there's no um

712
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,480
opportunity for mutation evolution not

713
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,799
naturally speaking

714
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,760
to improve the fitness you know in this

715
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,400
progeny

716
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,919
and so um this is what i would call a

717
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,400
degenerate reproduction

718
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,200
this is not the reproduction of life at

719
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,640
best

720
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,520
it is a kind of prokaryotic um

721
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,000
you know cell division kind of naive

722
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,120
asexual

723
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,360
reproduction at best okay

724
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,199
so there are some paradoxes within

725
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,000
bitcoin and with all of this stuff

726
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,039
and um i just um hope that we can spend

727
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,039
a little bit of time

728
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,240
unpacking some of those now and you know

729
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,679
hopefully they'll bring up some

730
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,840
questions that we can discuss

731
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,440
uh either at the end of this talk or at

732
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,760
a a

733
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,799
zero external event in the future and so

734
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,158
i'll read to you another

735
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:22,799
um stanza from one of the cpru poems

736
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,039
being at once dissented hyper capital

737
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,879
and subordinated machine socialism

738
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,400
where the abstract labor itself becomes

739
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,960
the means of production

740
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,240
mindlessly grinding as the commons burn

741
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,120
for what

742
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,320
to fortify a barren walled garden emote

743
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,120
without a castle

744
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,879
let alone a citadel and that's a

745
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,158
courtesy of satoshi wet

746
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,440
and so we've said the first part here

747
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,840
that this is like you know

748
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,919
hyper capital and transcendent machine

749
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,480
socialism so like how can those two

750
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,960
things

751
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,760
mesh together in some kind of meaningful

752
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,120
way and

753
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,158
others have written you know over the

754
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,399
years quite a lot about different um

755
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,000
philosophical angles within bitcoin so

756
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,240
you know for example colombia is written

757
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,480
on

758
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,240
politics of bitcoin as uh you know a

759
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,840
vector for right-wing extremism

760
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,600
and also more recently written about

761
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,120
crypto communism and the kind of mass

762
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,399
emancipatory potential

763
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:17,439
for um mostly other blockchains and uh

764
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,000
and revolutionary praxis and so on

765
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,480
so here's the kicker for me i think we

766
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,799
can leave

767
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,400
left and right politics out of this 99

768
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,039
of the planet hates bitcoin and for good

769
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,960
reason

770
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,039
bitcoin requires constant import of

771
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,919
export and export of randomness to find

772
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,320
blocks

773
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,120
this gigantic entropic generalization is

774
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,760
the output of

775
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,799
mining farms which soak up underutilized

776
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,600
resources

777
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,279
around earth the global consensus that

778
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,520
bitcoin desires

779
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,440
and strives for every 10 minutes on

780
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,440
average is the most expensive

781
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,760
luxury in the universe so

782
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,600
there's a mic drop and uh i will leave

783
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,039
this on the

784
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,039
screen while i take a walk to break

785
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,320
so necro primitivism it's time to go

786
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,320
back to school

787
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,918
and today's lesson is introduction to

788
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,520
necro primitivism so what the hell is

789
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,200
necro primitivism so

790
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,200
we've been talking about this resistance

791
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,799
to change inside the bitcoin network

792
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,640
through these validation requirements

793
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,918
the difficulty of getting consensus to

794
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,080
upgrade the networks

795
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,400
and this has given rise to what i call

796
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,158
an echo primitivist class inside bitcoin

797
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,600
and it informs some of the behaviors of

798
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,840
the social political

799
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,439
and economic aspects of the network so

800
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,678
let me read to you

801
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,799
a little provocation on this primitivist

802
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,039
priest card

803
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,000
on the screen for now there is only

804
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,400
thermotechnics

805
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,440
to centralize cosmic horror a zero-sum

806
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,679
machine of fire

807
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,880
sand and pressure synthesizing scorched

808
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,120
earth's realities

809
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,120
the heat death of the universe passes by

810
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,199
as we languish in plato's cave

811
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:51,678
so here's a psa is someone you know

812
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,159
a necroprimitivist somebody you know

813
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,320
hiding a dark secret

814
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,760
is does the person you know exhibit a

815
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,360
lack of imagination

816
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,039
some bitcoins believe it's easier to

817
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,199
imagine the in end of the world

818
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,279
than a new pro proving mechanism to

819
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,039
replace the mining

820
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,799
scorcher economics is another telltale

821
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,080
sign bitcoin has hate central banking

822
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,840
and fiat currencies so much

823
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,480
that the death of the universe is a

824
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,720
preferable outcome

825
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,080
scorched earth politics worshiping a

826
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,440
developer priesthood

827
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,199
and foretelling futures for minor

828
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,400
semiotics now this might require a

829
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,600
little bit of explanation

830
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,440
so when we talk about developer

831
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,799
priesthood we're talking about

832
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,279
the um the cathedral in the sense of

833
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,000
open source software and so these are

834
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,200
the

835
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,039
wizards of bitcoin uh which are mostly

836
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,360
white american males um who are trusted

837
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,360
with

838
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:47,439
the um janitorial

839
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:49,678
maintenance and assurance

840
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,120
of the code and the network that is

841
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,840
implemented from it

842
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,399
and i have some experience of speaking

843
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,360
with these

844
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,279
janitorial and primitivist types because

845
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,199
until quite recently part of my

846
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,360
days were spent uh raising money to pay

847
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,760
their salaries so i was sweeping floors

848
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,279
in the priesthood and so um when you

849
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,400
sweep floors you hear things and you

850
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,720
notice things

851
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,159
so we're going to move on now to the

852
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,760
discourse of how that is

853
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,200
scorched earth so as you said about

854
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,640
colombia's book there is this

855
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,240
ultra-libertarian bent

856
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,080
going through bitcoin and i suppose that

857
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,679
might be because the amount of coins

858
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,960
that were distributed at the start

859
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,200
before the first subsidy having the

860
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,720
first four years of bitcoin between 2010

861
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,159
2014

862
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,000
when nobody knew about bitcoin uh 10.5

863
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,279
of the 21 million coins were issued

864
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,840
and so the people that found bitcoin

865
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:38,880
very early have this enormous incentive

866
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:42,000
to keep things the way they are to not

867
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,000
let things change too much

868
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,158
and so there's this hyper individualist

869
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,520
going through bitcoin and again i can

870
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,080
speak to this because i was

871
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,520
also there for many years and there's

872
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,960
this you know this these things result

873
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,320
to this kind of zero-sum

874
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,320
community dynamics and if you want to

875
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,080
know what i mean go take a trip to

876
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,120
bitcoin twitter and see what a

877
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,520
uh uncharitable inhospitable place with

878
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,479
quality discourse that is they've

879
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,600
literally been having the same

880
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,679
conversations

881
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,039
for the last seven years as long as i've

882
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,640
been paying attention

883
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:14,720
and so this all results in this

884
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,399
overall resistance to change so without

885
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,720
the will to change

886
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,239
on the social layer like to convince the

887
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,039
necro primitivist priesthood the

888
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,159
developers

889
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:26,399
the minor oligopolists um who control

890
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:29,039
the the resources the hashrate

891
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,799
um nothing is possible like you need the

892
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,799
the buy-in of these two

893
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,158
stakeholders to make anything happen and

894
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,320
the economic side

895
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,520
and the user side well apparently

896
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,279
they're involved somehow

897
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,720
but some that that signaling is very

898
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,559
coarse and very informal

899
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,320
i suppose just them restricted to who

900
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,039
shouts the loudest on twitter

901
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,200
and so this kind of so-called

902
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,919
inter-subjective consensus

903
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,559
between users and the uh developers and

904
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,760
the miners

905
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,600
is what's meant to reinforce the um

906
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,120
trajectory of bitcoin but i would argue

907
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,279
that this is a new form of theater that

908
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,760
has replaced decentralization theater

909
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,399
and the signaling ground of twitter has

910
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,080
become

911
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:09,600
a new uh theater for uh battlegrounds

912
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,158
in fact i think it's been like this for

913
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,918
years so

914
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,679
what's an extra primitivist i think you

915
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,000
might still be looking at one so here's

916
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,399
me

917
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,760
18 months ago moderating a panel at one

918
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,559
of the premier technical bitcoin

919
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,000
conferences

920
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,678
on economic and social risks and

921
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,960
standing sitting beside me

922
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,039
was the technical editor of bitcoin

923
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,240
magazine aaron fanfield and

924
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:33,279
we were both calling out the cultish

925
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,120
nature of the bitcoin community to their

926
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,600
faces you know not just only to the you

927
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,199
know the

928
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,799
community at large we're talking about

929
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,159
the kind of vip

930
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,918
community of bitcoin people who go to

931
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,799
all the conferences that speak all these

932
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,640
things that have

933
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,840
ten to a million ten thousand two

934
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,000
million followers on twitter

935
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,039
the thought leaders of bitcoin and they

936
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,559
were laughing it up

937
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,559
laughing and applauding you can find

938
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,960
this talk online if you so choose

939
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,480
and uh more recently you can see i'm uh

940
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,520
as a screenshot from another talk i gave

941
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,760
her not so long ago

942
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,120
where i was running uh and founded and

943
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,720
edited a journal

944
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,158
called the crypto economic systems which

945
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,840
was based at the massachusetts institute

946
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,360
of technology media laboratory

947
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,120
at the digital currency initiative so

948
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,320
i've been sweeping quite a few

949
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,158
interesting flaws

950
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,760
meeting a lot of these interesting uh

951
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,440
people that are very close to these

952
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,559
networks that have a great deal of

953
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,360
um social technical and economic

954
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,279
gravitas

955
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:26,080
within these networks of networks

956
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,760
so let's talk about swans so people

957
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,520
always like to talk about black swans

958
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,279
and you've i've heard people say that

959
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,399
bitcoin is a black swan generator a

960
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,279
black swan tractor

961
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,080
it's always spitting out these crazy uh

962
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,760
event

963
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,960
based externalities and i would argue

964
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,600
that you could think of bitcoin as a

965
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,440
black swan

966
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,959
but more like a thermodynamic one but

967
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,399
let's talk about this white sperm

968
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,279
hypothesis which a lot of people have

969
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,600
spoken about

970
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,679
myself included i had to go through some

971
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:54,000
very embarrassing older talks to

972
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:56,640
dredge out my arguments um as to the

973
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
incentives that bitcoin might provide

974
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,440
towards the development of

975
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,919
cleaner and greener energy and on the

976
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,880
screen is a another card and there's a

977
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,519
quotation there

978
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,880
about like whose skin is in the game so

979
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,120
obviously the black swan is a

980
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,399
is a talib aphorism and title of a book

981
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,840
and so skin in the game

982
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,760
so the idea of skin in the game being

983
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,039
like incentives are

984
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,000
correlated to disincentives so like you

985
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,200
know you have to have

986
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
something at stake in order to reliably

987
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,440
be signaling

988
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,799
your the truth of your intentions and so

989
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,080
we were talking a while ago in the trust

990
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,639
discord about conspiracy theories and

991
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,840
cults

992
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,760
and movements and what the differences

993
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,559
might be between these things and

994
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,480
uh this person was seen talib said the

995
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,080
difference between a movement and a cult

996
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,600
is whether the skin in the game is your

997
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,279
own and others and that's something i

998
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,480
want to impress upon you because

999
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,480
some of the people in the stakeholder

1000
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,720
ecosystem of bitcoin do have some skill

1001
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,000
in the game and some of them don't

1002
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,240
um but that is not necessarily

1003
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
correlated with who holds sway

1004
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,799
whether explicit or implicit and that's

1005
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,440
something that's very important to note

1006
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,279
so we spoke about thermal economics and

1007
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,240
this incentive mechanism for the lottery

1008
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,480
and that this

1009
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,320
feedback mechanism that regulates the

1010
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,360
difficulty is the only sense8 connection

1011
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,080
in bitcoin

1012
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,879
and because the subsidy the amount of

1013
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,039
coins that

1014
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,080
a miner gets for finding the winning the

1015
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,679
lottery every block

1016
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,199
it's halving on this predetermined

1017
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,200
schedule every four years

1018
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,240
there is this incentive double jeopardy

1019
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,519
that as the

1020
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,200
number of coins becomes scarcer and

1021
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,480
scarcer the amount of energy required to

1022
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,440
defend the network becomes greater and

1023
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,519
greater and greater

1024
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,960
and this uh you know it's no this is

1025
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,679
kind of like a game of chicken

1026
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,559
and so we don't know who blinks first um

1027
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,159
or you know

1028
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,559
what happens when these two things crash

1029
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,240
into each other and so

1030
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,840
we used to talk about bitcoin as being a

1031
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,480
way to make payments and

1032
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,879
this was a a form of fast and cheap and

1033
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,120
uh

1034
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,240
facile value transfer and we had to walk

1035
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,678
back on that one because the

1036
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,000
transactions got expensive

1037
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,200
turns out space in the blockchain to

1038
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,120
confirm your transaction

1039
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,360
is a precious resource and people were

1040
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,518
willing to pay quite a lot for that

1041
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,479
and so there became this rise of this

1042
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,440
narrative shift as

1043
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,240
long as schwartz and others have

1044
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,519
discussed since 2013 of digital metalism

1045
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,960
you could think of bitcoin's digital

1046
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,039
gold you've probably heard about this

1047
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,480
analogy and you could think of this as

1048
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,679
an

1049
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,360
ideology this is like a computational

1050
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,799
ideology and we mentioned columbia

1051
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,479
earlier we're going to read a little bit

1052
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,000
from a quote of his from the cultural

1053
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,720
logic of computation

1054
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,399
on the card computationalism underwrites

1055
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,559
and reinforces a surprisingly

1056
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,959
traditionalist conception of human being

1057
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,399
society and politics in other registers

1058
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,600
we might imagine these views to have

1059
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,120
long been abandoned

1060
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,959
in large part because their faults as

1061
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,158
part of the total account of human being

1062
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,120
have long ago demonstrated bin long ago

1063
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,799
demonstrated conclusively and so because

1064
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,080
bitcoin has this inability to mitigate

1065
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,399
or even have awareness of its

1066
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,158
externalities and because there is no

1067
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,760
alternative there is no other consensus

1068
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,080
mechanism that has been proven

1069
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,559
at scale computationally and

1070
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:58,879
economically

1071
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,879
is there no alternative at two margaret

1072
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,320
we live in hope i've been waiting for

1073
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,360
proof for ethereum to move away from

1074
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,000
proof of work

1075
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,520
since it was first announced in 2014

1076
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,679
still waiting

1077
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,800
so we often hear this and i've often

1078
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,520
said these things myself

1079
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,800
in times gone by solar energy and wind

1080
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,520
will save bitcoin

1081
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,960
the shuttered aluminium uh plants next

1082
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,000
to three gorgeous dam

1083
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,599
hydro uh outlets will save bitcoin

1084
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,040
the green indexes say that most of the

1085
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,000
energy in bitcoin is sustainable and

1086
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,159
renewable

1087
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,199
well you know i know the people that

1088
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,440
wrote these reports

1089
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,879
people like uh chris bendington and

1090
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,560
michelle rouse

1091
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,480
and a lot of these reports are relying

1092
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,440
on self-reporting and self-reporting is

1093
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,280
susceptible to

1094
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,960
goodheart's law which means that you

1095
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,720
know people may not report honestly

1096
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,839
they may report for their interests

1097
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:50,078
rather than to report

1098
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,918
and then you know where do things like

1099
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,960
uranium and biomass come into all of

1100
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,839
this like we've been researching

1101
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,839
chemical industry

1102
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:57,759
externalities and trust not in recent

1103
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,480
times and a lot of the time people talk

1104
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,800
about

1105
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,680
biomass as a renewable energy so one of

1106
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,960
my colleagues

1107
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,240
used to develop um power management

1108
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,839
algorithms at

1109
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,319
the drax family of power stations in the

1110
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,200
uk and one of the things that they do is

1111
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,480
they do lots of

1112
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,879
renewable energy but one of their

1113
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,359
renewable energies is um

1114
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,160
wood biomass it's processed wood that

1115
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,920
they chop

1116
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,440
up then burn and they plant some more

1117
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,400
trees does that sound

1118
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,839
green do you i think they just do it so

1119
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,040
they can burn they can use coal plants

1120
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,599
to burn stuff

1121
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,040
excuse me you also have to remember that

1122
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,800
there are embodied costs

1123
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,320
to all of these things like solar panels

1124
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,680
the silicon has to come from somewhere

1125
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,040
the exotic materials

1126
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,040
the photovoltaics have to come from

1127
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,759
somewhere i have a phd in photovoltaic

1128
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,400
technology

1129
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,440
i watched the solar panel industry and

1130
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,119
technology develop

1131
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,280
at that same time that i was doing my

1132
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,760
research we are still not there yet

1133
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,720
um there uh there is only a marginal

1134
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,119
benefit of running

1135
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,959
solar panels that we have today when we

1136
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,839
do these life cycle analysis

1137
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,680
analyses maybe one day we'll be making

1138
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,078
solar panels out of graphene

1139
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,359
or some other kind of cheaper um

1140
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,960
reproducible material

1141
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,119
that has minimal externalities but until

1142
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,440
we get there this is still

1143
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,400
um problematic and one of the worst

1144
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,720
things about

1145
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,480
bitcoin it's kind of like part of the

1146
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,160
very foundation of the house of cards

1147
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,480
that bitcoin is built on

1148
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,078
in terms of centralization anyway is

1149
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,839
that there are only a handful of places

1150
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,320
you can actually fabricate

1151
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:25,040
um semiconductors silicon wafers to make

1152
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,040
computing

1153
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,400
chips and so bitcoin requires

1154
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,079
specialized computing chips there is

1155
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,960
this enormous arms race due to these

1156
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,400
incentives

1157
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,079
to create a more efficient and uh

1158
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,520
you know more performant more energy

1159
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,280
efficient and more perform performance

1160
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,200
efficient

1161
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,800
mining chips for these application

1162
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,200
specific integrated circuits

1163
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,240
asics uh the bitcoin mining machines

1164
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,759
that create these

1165
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,520
gigantic farms next to these hydro

1166
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,960
plants and whatever there's only a

1167
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,480
handful of these plants in the world

1168
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,160
making one is very hard you require a

1169
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,480
great deal of capital and a great deal

1170
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,640
of

1171
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,760
um know-how i know people that used to

1172
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,040
work on

1173
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,800
uh silicon fabrication is extremely as

1174
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,960
a business with extremely high barriers

1175
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,280
to entry and so the problem here is

1176
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,480
if you want to make bitcoin mining chip

1177
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,720
you need to have a friend

1178
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,599
at one of these places that will let you

1179
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,118
get your

1180
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:17,440
um your uh production batch

1181
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,800
in the queue among the sony's and the

1182
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,560
apples of this world

1183
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,079
samsungs of this world it's very

1184
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,520
difficult to do

1185
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,440
so let's talk more about this white swan

1186
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,960
so mining energy costs are mostly paid

1187
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,280
in fiat

1188
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,560
the piper that the miners have to pay to

1189
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,640
win these bitcoin rewards

1190
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,078
is mostly denominated in yuan or dollars

1191
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,078
or pounds or euros

1192
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,280
so the token price the price of the

1193
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,760
price of bitcoin

1194
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,040
matters every time the price of bitcoin

1195
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,960
goes up

1196
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,480
the price on bitcoin's head from this

1197
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,880
kind of um

1198
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,240
uh bounty that we discussed earlier and

1199
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,560
also the um

1200
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,000
incentives to defend the network against

1201
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,200
um uh them

1202
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,320
against a 51 attacks against uh honest

1203
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,200
attacks

1204
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,560
compliant in the protocol must increase

1205
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,439
we must put more energy into this thing

1206
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,200
to keep it safe

1207
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,440
it becomes more valuable makes sense

1208
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,359
right and so here's a

1209
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,480
quote from an old paper which tries to

1210
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,759
describe

1211
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:17,040
um the value of a bitcoin

1212
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,960
solely internal to the system

1213
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,160
okay considering the functionality of

1214
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,680
the bitcoin network

1215
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,759
the current value of one bitcoin may be

1216
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,040
understood implicitly as the value of

1217
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,720
150 seconds

1218
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,640
of the computational results directed at

1219
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,359
defending the network from thermodynamic

1220
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,799
attacks

1221
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,160
and providing a high probability of

1222
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,920
assurance that the integrity of the

1223
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:38,160
canonical ledger will continue to be

1224
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,160
maintained okay so

1225
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,839
and let's wrap up now by taking this to

1226
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,680
the kind of logical end point

1227
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:45,680
so if bitcoin is this black hole and it

1228
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,520
wants to suck all the energy out of

1229
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,879
you know where as far as it can see to

1230
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,440
its event horizon

1231
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,920
where is that so uh there are these

1232
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,920
things

1233
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,440
in the universe that we call kind of

1234
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,880
constants and natural laws

1235
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,800
whether they're constant whether natural

1236
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,520
laws is another matter in fact the most

1237
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,680
interesting

1238
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,560
uh scientific talk i ever saw during my

1239
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,118
tenure as a

1240
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,839
as a physicist and chemist was by john a

1241
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,079
popple iii

1242
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,839
nobel prize winner which was called his

1243
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,320
chemistry branch of pure mathematics

1244
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,960
where he took apart every single natural

1245
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,000
law

1246
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,680
and fundamental constant that um people

1247
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,440
would uh shout out from the

1248
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,720
from the lecture theater armed with only

1249
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,599
a uh

1250
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,359
a sharpie and a piece of transparent

1251
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,800
plastic on an overhead projector

1252
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:30,160
so um the light from the sun

1253
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,240
takes eight and a half minutes to reach

1254
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,520
earth at the yeah near enough

1255
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,759
the speed of light that is an upper

1256
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,800
limit or an asymptote at least in our

1257
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,000
side of the veil and so that's kind of

1258
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,640
like a

1259
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,599
hard limit of how far bitcoin can go

1260
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,000
back to the sun

1261
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,440
basically like imagine a circular radius

1262
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,280
from the earth the sun and

1263
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:53,920
other side towards mars but

1264
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,440
because of the way the lottery works um

1265
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,000
every second you move away from the

1266
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,760
economic

1267
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,280
center of gravity of bitcoin you're

1268
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,119
hamstringing yourself

1269
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,640
and this race against the other miners

1270
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,240
that are close to the center of gravity

1271
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,759
think about how high frequency trading

1272
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,560
works people built

1273
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,560
computer exchanges next to the chicago

1274
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,000
mercantile exchange so that they could

1275
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,480
shave milliseconds off their trading

1276
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,560
times

1277
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,599
and jump in before other people and so

1278
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,720
this is what would happen in this

1279
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,240
thermodynamic lottery

1280
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,919
if you even went just a few light

1281
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,359
seconds away to the moon you would be at

1282
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,839
this advantage compared to everybody

1283
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,160
else

1284
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,920
it's usually on a matter of seconds the

1285
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,799
winning block versus another one

1286
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,920
and so unless so much hash power is

1287
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,760
deployed

1288
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,119
off earth that the center of economic

1289
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,560
gravity of bitcoin moves

1290
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,400
also off earth i i don't see how um

1291
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,440
the network is constrained by the

1292
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,200
current parameters things like the

1293
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,520
10-minute block time and so on

1294
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,560
and so bitcoin mining in space maybe

1295
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,720
nearby

1296
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,560
um maybe we could make a death star like

1297
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,399
maybe bitcoin could be the death star

1298
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,680
and so we all talk about dyson few

1299
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,280
thousand spheres and

1300
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,720
you know cold fusion and all these kinds

1301
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,880
of things sounds great

1302
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,399
but like the planet is burning now and

1303
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,760
bitcoin is trying to suck all the air

1304
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,760
out of the room now

1305
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,119
so even with all these things it will

1306
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,200
still be a brute force thermodynamic

1307
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,599
arms race bitcoin requires

1308
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,720
a simple majority of all of the energy

1309
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,480
that it can see

1310
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,240
in order to know that it's in order to

1311
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,599
be secure doesn't know that it's secure

1312
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,959
but in order to be secure

1313
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,800
and so it just wants to suck all the

1314
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,680
energy out of the room and so

1315
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,240
the tldr here is that bitcoin has this

1316
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,399
you know

1317
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,040
putative form of artificial life if you

1318
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,640
believe or agree with ralph merkel

1319
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,400
bitcoin is in competition with natural

1320
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,359
life for the harvest of energy

1321
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,319
this side of the sun and that means that

1322
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,560
in effect

1323
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,520
bitcoin it's not artificial life it's

1324
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,880
artificial death

1325
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,480
it's trying to suck all the oxygen out

1326
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,839
of the room or the photons out of the

1327
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,560
room or the energy out of the room

1328
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,759
so that it may prosper and survive and

1329
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,599
it doesn't care it

1330
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,440
can't care about you you can't care

1331
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,680
about me can't care about us

1332
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,200
they can't care about our planet and so

1333
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,480
um this is the

1334
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,399
uh where i'm going to wrap up this

1335
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,119
latest stage uh latest uh

1336
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,800
interim state of uh xerox salon topic

1337
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,599
number five indifference engine

1338
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,480
uh research um i hope it hasn't been uh

1339
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,839
too

1340
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,839
scatty and disorganized i had very

1341
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:08,319
little time to prepare this um

1342
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,880
and i hope that so you can join me for q

1343
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,119
a

1344
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,920
after the talk now and so thanks very

1345
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,640
much for listening

1346
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,400
uh this is a a archived picture of me

1347
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,319
sweeping some flaws and

1348
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,520
i work at the xerox salon which is an

1349
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,119
informal research collective

1350
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,560
approaching unusual topics with

1351
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,480
post-disciplinary activities

1352
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,599
involving discourse art and writing if

1353
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,839
you'd like to know more about

1354
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,839
the xerox salon please visit xerox

1355

s-a-l-o-n-dot

1356
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,200
and thanks very much for your time there

1357
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:40,319
was sim that was an amazing talk

1358
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,839
and really really

1359
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,560
heartwarming to see how things are

1360
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,880
evolving uh for you

1361
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,240
in the last couple of months how you

1362
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,359
sure you've been there with me on this

1363
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,720
journey

1364
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:55,200
yeah yeah yeah like a year ago when

1365
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,200
we had this discussion back at trust i

1366
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,879
was

1367
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:04,319
trying to to poke through uh some

1368
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,079
ecological perspective um trying to

1369
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,839
trying to address this relation between

1370
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,960
the ecological and the economical

1371
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:13,359
and and uh i really appreciate uh

1372
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,280
the trajectory that you're taking i

1373
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,000
think i let my thermodynamic defenses

1374
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,040
down between

1375
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,560
now and then it it's really and and it's

1376
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,520
lovely that it comes right after

1377
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,119
christine's talk

1378
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,759
i mean eugenio my talk i changed the

1379
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,000
topic

1380
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,119
i adapted it so that it fits

1381
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,920
ecologically

1382
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,920
uh christine and wesson's talk but it's

1383
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,800
like what i'm going to present is kind

1384
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,200
of

1385
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,960
a a very close resonance to what wasim

1386
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,520
is discussing so maybe

1387
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,720
we should uh get a few questions from

1388
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,200
the audience before

1389
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,640
i step in yeah i think the audience have

1390
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,839
just a lot of comments

1391
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,799
uh maybe now some of you some

1392
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,520
are coming up i felt like quite a lot of

1393
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,440
them were more

1394
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,359
kind of polemic comments rather than

1395
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,359
things that we can we can discuss in

1396
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:01,680
detail but hey there are new stuff

1397
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,119
recently still okay here's one that i

1398
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,279
think might be interesting it says

1399
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,240
actually making bitcoin co2 neutral

1400
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,079
would be very cheap

1401
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,479
half a percent of the value at a very

1402
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,560
conservative uh estimation

1403
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,079
and i mean that might be true actually

1404
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,400
it might be quite cheap to uh

1405
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,160
green bitcoin but the problem is because

1406
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,319
bitcoin is not sensitive to the energy

1407
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,319
that's going into it as we've discussed

1408
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:23,839
how would you know and so like all it

1409
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,839
takes is another kind of

1410
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,599
a marginal step down of some other

1411
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,279
non-green form of energy

1412
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,760
and that would re-enter the mix just

1413
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,240
because of this kind of um

1414
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,359
rational energy market that we mostly

1415
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,078
find ourselves with

1416
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:39,200
bitcoin is seeking the cheapest energy

1417
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,800
and it doesn't really care

1418
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,799
what it is um

1419
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,520
satoshi you are still polluting the

1420
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,400
planet with heat you are still

1421
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,759
responsible

1422
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,520
now this is an interesting point that we

1423
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,880
came to the salon when we talked about

1424
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,040
algorithmic realism

1425
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,079
which is like you're a developer you

1426
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,920
write some code

1427
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,119
you put it on the web or github or

1428
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,240
whatever and then you

1429
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,800
disappear you might die you um left the

1430
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,399
planet

1431
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,920
and somebody else implements your code

1432
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,400
or puts your code in somewhere something

1433
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,680
else

1434
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,160
are you still responsible for what

1435
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,440
people use it for like so satoshi wrote

1436
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,920
some code

1437
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,440
and then satoshi implemented a network

1438
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,200
and then disappeared

1439
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,680
are they still responsible it's an

1440
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,960
interesting question

1441
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:28,160
i think there's a danielle ass uh

1442
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,319
sounds familiar thanks for the talk

1443
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,720
crypto will hunting

1444
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,400
do you see a possibility of decoupling

1445
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,200
bitcoin's value

1446
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,800
from its energy usage this is actually

1447
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,520
really interesting question uh thanks

1448
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,040
daniel

1449
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:44,800
um and it actually seems to be a similar

1450
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,520
question to the one that goes around

1451
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,800
in the uh degrowth world which um you

1452
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,280
know christine would be very familiar

1453
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,240
with

1454
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,119
on the decoupling of economic economic

1455
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,839
uh

1456
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,720
uh prosperity and energy consumption and

1457
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,960
it's actually kind of

1458
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,399
almost the same uh thing that we're

1459
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,200
grappling with here

1460
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,800
and the real question with bitcoin the

1461
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,560
way it works now i don't think so i

1462
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,160
don't think that's possible i think

1463
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,759
the energy draining of the system will

1464
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,598
be accompanied by a loss of confidence

1465
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,880
in the security of the system

1466
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:16,720
and unless there's some uh other way of

1467
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,040
arranging or connecting the

1468
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,160
uh cryptographic and the economic aspect

1469
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,599
of bitcoin together

1470
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,279
i just don't see how we're going to do

1471
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,040
that

1472
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,119
yeah christine what about decoupling

1473
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,119
what's your

1474
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,040
official or unofficial take on

1475
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,240
decoupling

1476
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:37,040
yeah i mean um

1477
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,000
yeah i mean like i i touch upon the talk

1478
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,640
like we

1479
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,599
um we have achieved relative decoupling

1480
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,118
like we

1481
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:47,440
ever obviously um energy has become

1482
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,400
become more energy efficient um but the

1483
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,359
thing is like

1484
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,800
we're still aiming towards um like

1485
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:56,000
absolute gdp growth

1486
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,839
um so that like means material

1487
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,040
throughput and often energy itself also

1488
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,560
like well simply

1489
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,319
consumption will continue to rise

1490
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,000
regardless of how like efficient we're

1491
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,119
being because we're demanding like ever

1492
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,560
more energy

1493
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:09,359
um so um yeah then people are arguing

1494
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,040
that

1495
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:13,279
like sufficient absolute company

1496
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,720
decoupling is possible but

1497
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,400
many people in the ecological sector

1498
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,439
argue against that because simply

1499
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,319
because we don't have enough

1500
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,440
time and we need to act now on climate

1501
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,839
change mitigation

1502
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,640
um so the simplest way to do that would

1503
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,839
be to lower

1504
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,520
like energy usage itself um and because

1505
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:32,240
we're quite wasteful with it anyways

1506
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,640
so um i guess my personal opinion about

1507
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,118
um

1508
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,000
bitcoin or cryptocurrencies that use

1509
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,000
energy

1510
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,680
system or it's maybe just like a bit of

1511
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,400
a

1512
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,640
bit of a challenge is is like i don't

1513
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,400
consider something innovative

1514
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,240
unless it's ecological so i don't i

1515
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,280
don't consider

1516
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:53,040
um proof of work innovative at all um

1517
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,400
like it through the lens through my

1518
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,960
extremely biased lens

1519
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,800
um but i think that's just like uh maybe

1520
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,160
that's just a provocation

1521
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,480
that's a good provocation christine what

1522
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,319
i might encounter with is say that

1523
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,680
um if proof of work may not be

1524
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:08,720
ecologically valuable

1525
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,078
uh as it is but it may um provide a way

1526
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,118
forward to something that does have an

1527
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,200
ecological value

1528
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,800
innovative sense i just think it's like

1529
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,960
it's pretty disappointing because

1530
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,400
when it was developed it's like we were

1531
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,280
you know we were well aware of these

1532
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,319
environmental

1533
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,000
issues so i just feel like at this

1534
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,839
at this in this day and age like if

1535
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,640
you're gonna call your

1536
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,279
your work uh innovative like it has to

1537
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:33,040
be

1538
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,559
aligned with civilizational longevity um

1539
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,240
you know and it's just and that's my

1540
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:39,440
like very strong opinion about it

1541
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,040
um but also like with bitcoin

1542
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,960
i don't know too much about it but isn't

1543
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,880
like the majority of the wealth

1544
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,240
also held in very few hands like it kind

1545
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,599
of is mirroring

1546
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,240
the the well disparity in society as is

1547
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,200
and i i

1548
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,240
also like you know propose people think

1549
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,078
on that metric

1550
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,598
um and really really think about whether

1551
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,200
or not this is

1552
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,319
going the direction we want it to go if

1553
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,480
it's the response to 2008 2009 recession

1554
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:06,240
it shouldn't be containing external you

1555
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,720
know ecological externalities

1556
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,598
it's it's not radical then right like

1557
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,598
yeah there's a big

1558
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,960
there's a big difference between um

1559
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,000
where we where

1560
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,079
the network was intended to go and do

1561
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,200
and achieve and the kind of grand vision

1562
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,119
of that

1563
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,879
and what it has achieved so it's

1564
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,040
achieved more than its minimal promise

1565
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,319
but it's fallen far short of its maximal

1566
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,880
promise so this was meant to be

1567
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:29,759
something very

1568
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,680
egalitarian one cpu one vote like a

1569
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,680
computer democracy a machine democracy

1570
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,960
what we ended up with is a machine

1571
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:40,480
oligopoly a machine cartel

1572
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,920
the the um industrialization of the

1573
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,440
mining wasn't foreseen

1574
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,240
originally and so there weren't any

1575
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,119
failsafes put in uh to mitigate against

1576
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,439
uh

1577
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,520
centralization and and the coalescence

1578
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,599
of power in that way

1579
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,759
um the developer priesthood which we

1580
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:58,400
talked about i think that

1581
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,920
um satoshi would have been blind to that

1582
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,920
because satoshi was

1583
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,079
one like so this is something that was

1584
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,119
created in the person's image

1585
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:10,880
to perpetuate uh you know small

1586
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:13,920
cadre of expert wizard people

1587
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,400
and in terms of gosh weber obi in terms

1588
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,720
of the

1589
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:21,920
ecology i mean uh

1590
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,319
people always shift the boundaries shift

1591
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,760
the

1592
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,480
goal posts as the expectations and the

1593
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,240
reality

1594
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,400
diverge more from the bitcoin we wish we

1595
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:34,160
had and the bitcoin we ended up with

1596
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:37,040
and um at some point

1597
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:38,558
um people have to kind of take stock of

1598
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,319
the situation this is kind of what i'm

1599
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,839
doing with this talk like i was one of

1600
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,720
these people banging the drums saying

1601
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:45,119
that

1602
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,919
the cost was worth it all of this energy

1603
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,920
was worth it

1604
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,319
to have a stateless value transfer

1605
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,720
system and but now i'm looking around

1606
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,680
and thinking this is pretty high cost

1607
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:57,118
and it's increasingly

1608
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:59,200
very rapidly uh look outside and

1609
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,480
the externalities seem to be piling up

1610
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,640
and so at some point

1611
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,760
you have to make that value judgment and

1612
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,558
every person has to do that for

1613
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,400
themselves

1614
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,160
and just try to tell my story of how i

1615
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,880
did that and how it tipped from one side

1616
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,118
to the other

1617
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,000
but i could totally see christine while

1618
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,000
this was never

1619
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,040
a contest for you um because you've

1620
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,559
probably had like

1621
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,319
some fairly rock solid values all the

1622
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:20,000
way through whereas i was on the side of

1623
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,200
the machines before so i'm coming over

1624
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,970
to team human now

1625
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:26,558
plus she she's canadian

1626
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:30,160
[Laughter]

1627
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:31,839
um yeah cool um do you have some

1628
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:34,078
other question here that you want to

1629
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:37,119
pick up um

1630
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:41,280
there was one wasn't there where was it

1631
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:42,720
um if over here we can do this one

1632
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,640
if the whole bitcoin mine community was

1633
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:47,520
listening to you right now

1634
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,040
uh where was it yeah oh uh what would

1635
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:53,040
you suggest to them to reduce the

1636
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:55,680
ecological impact of bitcoin mining

1637
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,880
well i mean uh like again like coming

1638
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,640
back to christine's talk

1639
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,400
discourse and discussion is the most

1640
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,160
important thing so what happens now

1641
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,520
is a lot of kind of green washing where

1642
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,558
people in the bitcoin mining industry

1643
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,960
are always saying

1644
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,280
we use mostly green energy it's mostly

1645
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,880
from dams and solar and blah blah blah

1646
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,040
and so i really the first we have to

1647
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,839
start with an honest debate about what's

1648
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,960
going on here

1649
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:17,040
that's kind of what we're trying to do

1650
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,280
with the salon and with this provocation

1651
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,119
and the problem is most of the time when

1652
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,240
people bring this conversation to the

1653
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,280
bitcoin community

1654
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,598
they're coming from outside the

1655
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,920
community so people are

1656
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,440
um very skeptical of people coming from

1657
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,119
outside the bitcoin community

1658
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,319
telling people how to fix bitcoin

1659
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:33,440
because that's been going on since the

1660
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:36,720
start

1661
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,280
and so maybe it's possible if people

1662
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,558
from

1663
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,319
that have some stature and some

1664
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,520
familiarity and expertise with how

1665
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,599
bitcoin works and

1666
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:45,040
what it does and the people around it

1667
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,240
might bring up these points

1668
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,079
that we might be able to have a more

1669
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,720
substantive discussion and that's the

1670
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:54,160
starting point i think you know

1671
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:57,520
unfortunately planet is burning while we

1672
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,520
wait to start these conversations

1673
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:04,610
[Music]

1674
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:09,489
[Laughter]

1675
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:09,489
[Music]

1676
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:29,839
wow

1677
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:43,920
you
