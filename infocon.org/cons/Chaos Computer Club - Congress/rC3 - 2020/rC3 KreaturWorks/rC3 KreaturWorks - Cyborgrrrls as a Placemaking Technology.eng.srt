people were

90
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,560
crafting and creating in mexico city

91
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,000
back in 2017

92
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,040
and we needed to create community so

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,400
we wanted to get together and to learn

94
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,599
and that's why we

95
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,959

um say hello everybody um

100
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,640
[Music]

see when we start um

102
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:19,759
in 2017 the idea was to meet with

103
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,759
other women and non-binary people in

104
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,550
mexico city

105
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,800
and

106
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:28,000
[Music]

107
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,680
first cyber girls we don't do um

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
we don't need um open call just we meet

109
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,400
with

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,040
local communities uh

111
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,039
some groups the woman group

112
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,080
participating in

113
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,120
in the hacker space in mexico city or

114
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,240
also women doing

115
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,160
a traditional technology

116
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,960
and and then after the the first five

117
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,960
workers

118
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:02,080
we did an open call and more peop

119
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,960
more people from other countries

120
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,960
can join us

121
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,719
yeah so basically as

122
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,759
constanza said what we do is uh

123
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,320
we make we get together to make hand

124
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,520
work

125
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,000
mostly and uh

126
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,320
to create our own kind of language

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,520
through the work that we make

128
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,919
um we believe that

129
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,039
each practice has its own technique and

130
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,159
language and that

131
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,960
all practices are valuable

132
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,240
uh we communicate through crafts as a

133
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,280
threat as a strategy

134
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,320
of non-verbal communication

135
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,679
and make sharing knowledge

136
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,680
makes us inclusive in practices that are

137
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,479
usually exclusive

138
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,000
we believe that creating and crafting

139
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,280
together

140
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,360
creates community and

141
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,198
we are retaking the strategies to create

142
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,440
community by bringing back

143
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,440
the craft that because of gender

144
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,440
division did not belong to

145
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,600
us as women or that was believed as such

146
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,440
and we feel pride for the knowledge and

147
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,840
practices of the grand mass and

148
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,840
ancestral knowledge as well

149
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
um

150
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,199
so yeah we've been holding this event

151
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,560
for

152
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:33,680
uh almost

153
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,600

154

155
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,240

156
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,400
traditional crafts section or

157
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,440
practices that we have for example we

158
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,560
have a fancy

159
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:54,000

a things other not so traditional

164

that are more related to electronics so

165
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,120
we create

166
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,479
we create circuits we work

167
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:24,400
with open source we also

168
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,400
host biohacking workshops

[Music]

170
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,960

171
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:40,880
in the in our meeting is to be together

00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:54,319
[Music]

177
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,960
see we we try to include

178
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,879
all technologies and new technologies

179
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,919
and

180
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,280
and also for us our start

181
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,280
point is our body

182
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,879
and also we try to

183
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:17,359
claim our save space for us

184
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:22,479
on internet and

185
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:25,520
and also we try to sing

186
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:30,318
in a feminist way to create

187
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:32,929
um to recreate the idea

188
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,320
of technology now including

189
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:39,120
[Music]

190
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,049
uh spiritual values and also political

191
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,229
value

192
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:43,228
[Music]

193
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:50,480
yeah as constanza said the main thing is

194
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,560
to get together and to and the body as a

195
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,959
technology is something very important

196
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,319
so as you can see here in the picture we

197
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,079
have many bodies

198
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,560
back in the days when this was a

199
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,880
possible thing

200
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,880
the gathering of people and

201
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,880
um

202
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,800
and changing as she was saying changing

203
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,439
our relationship to

204
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,719
um technology is something super

205
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,320
important

206
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,720
so i think it's important to highlight

207
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,680
our relation to the internet also

208
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,000
because of

209
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:31,199
all this virtual format we are having

210
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,600
in this event and

211
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,440
well we believe that internet is a

212
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,720
common resource

213
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,519
and we advocate for free internet and

214
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,560
the defense of digital rights

215
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,600
uh that is why we teach workshops on

216
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,160
tales and digital security and we make

217
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,800
installed parties we reflect about the

218
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,959
internet

219
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,160
it's privatization and the need to

220
00:09:52,959 --> 00:10:00,079
defend the freedom in the virtual realm

221
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,079
so um

222
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,959
we seek to

223
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,160
encourage people to use internet in an

224
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,760
anonymous way

225
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:16,800
and in find alternatives way ways to

226
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,800
use the internet and

227
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,760
um well

228
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,000
also as the same idea of the internet

229
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,480
being open we like our workshops to be

230
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,120
open

231
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,320
i think it's important to highlight this

232
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,160
that

233
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,360
we want them to be accessible to

234
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,560
everyone

235
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,399
and they are a really low cost or no

236
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,279
cost at all it depends on

237
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,800
on the person that is hosting the

238
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:45,120
workshop

239
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:48,319
and also like we see

240
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,720
our meeting as a common

241
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,519
this means that it's made out of the

242
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,920
effort of

243
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,320
everybody of all the participants and

244
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,120
each one contributes in a different way

245
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,360
they

246
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,200
like you have to bring your own gear but

247
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,120
also be able to share it

248
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,000
and you bring your working materials we

249
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,120
provide some materials but

250
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,120
and everything is shared

251
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,279
but also it's very important for us to

252
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,760
share our

253
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,279
knowledge with everybody we feel this is

254
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,839
also like a common and

255
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,600
that is one of the most important things

256
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,780
of the meeting that everything is for

257
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,040
everyone

258
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:29,279
[Music]

259
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,120
which take us to the idea that somehow

260
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,839
we still follow this ancient

261
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,440
principle sumac aside maybe constance do

262
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,440
you want to talk a little bit about this

263
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,320
see that is

264
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,800
an idea from

265
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:56,800
our ancestors in andean

266
00:11:48,800 --> 00:12:00,399
area in south america it means

267
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:04,959
yeah it's a way to live in the planet

268
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:08,839
thinking in the planet is is alive and

269
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,160
we have to take care of each other and

270
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,959
also

271
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:18,560
we have to try to live in a good way

272
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,160
and take care of the earth and the our

273
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,000
resources

274
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,360
and for us is important also in

275
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,680
the techno feminist meeting to include

276
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,680
uh

277
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,399
ancestral technology because

278
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,850
also in in south america on

279
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,480
whole latin america

280
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:45,519
[Music]

281
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,800
there are technologies

282
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:52,079
um connected with the nature as

283
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:56,079
plants natural medicines

284
00:12:52,079 --> 00:13:00,560
medicines with cannabis or

285
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:04,638
connected to a spiritual life

286
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:09,279
so that's the idea to make outside

287
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:12,639
another way to live including

288
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,880
the our bodily connected with with the

289
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,800
air

290
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,800
yeah exactly

291
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,160
yeah so here are some examples of the

292
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,360
workshops that consistency was talking

293
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,439
about

294
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:32,560
um we had this uh

295
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,000
which workshop which was about

296
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,920
magical keys for uh

297
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,160
freedom and um

298
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,240
and yeah it was about bringing back the

299
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,240
ancestral knowledge from our grandmas

300
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,569
contemporary world

301
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,570
[Music]

302
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,440
also we believe

303
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,760
that the

304
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,079
there is yeah as concerns i was saying

305
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,000
that there is this political notion of

306
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:12,239
technology that we want to bring up

307
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,600
so uh we really feel like the use of

308
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,040
technology

309
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,480
as we wanna share it

310
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:24,880
has definitely a political

311
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:28,839
side to it so we for example give these

312
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,360
workshops about the political notion of

313
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,760
coding and

314
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,079
life coding also with a feminist

315
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,399
perspective

316
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:44,160
and we also work a lot with the idea

317
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:48,000
of decolonizing and how do we decolonize

318
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:51,439
well first of all we don't sell we share

319
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,560
the knowledge and

320
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,720
uh our what we create and what we

321
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,040
teach is not meant to be solved in a

322
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,000
capitalist colonialist market

323
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,760
is another thing it's a different thing

324
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,639
we want to create a different

325
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:12,079
economy a different society a different

326
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,880
alternative to that patriarchal system

327
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,880
and so

328
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,760
we believe that our practices decolonize

329
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,120
for the mere fact that getting together

330
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,199
gives back to the

331
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,480
spiritual and political sense of the

332
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,680
community

333
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,800
and especially especially uh the sharing

334
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,880
between women that

335
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,959
were excluded from the most commercial

336
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,160
aspects of craft

337
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,920
and as we say and as we believe the main

338
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,319
idea of the meeting is to recreate the

339
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,479
technological imaginaries from a latin

340
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,560
america from latin american feminist

341
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:50,720
speculation and therefore we

342
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:54,000
are decolonizing knowledge

343
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,519
too which is kind of related to

344
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,399
the idea of place making that we will

345
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:09,839
talk about

346
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:09,839
a little bit later

347
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:17,680
so um constance do you want to add a

348
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,680
little bit to it

349
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:25,279
not just to say because

350
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,758
la pandemia this year we can we can do

351
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,120
just

352
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:33,759
one week of our meeting

353
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:37,440
normally is two weeks and

354
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:41,759
and we don't continue in a online

355
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,800
version because we we

356
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:49,040
prefer to be

357
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,279
to keep time for us to think

358
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,079
how we can continue but now it's

359
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:58,800
difficult to think because we don't know

360
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:02,719
if next year we can do it or not

361
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,719
now you can read our

362
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:12,160
statement that we write on our

363
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:15,359
uh our blog on internet

364
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,150
we have to write a letter about the

365
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,359
situation this year

366
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:24,640
[Music]

367
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:27,839
because we try to think in

368
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,200
in the the world

369
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,600
change this year but

370
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,360
we are continuous thinking in a feminist

371
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,559
way to

372
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,520
to be together using including

373
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:42,799
technologies

374
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:46,960
but not maybe not only

375
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:50,000
online but we are thinking about

376
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:54,559
how we can we can be

377
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,320
on internet and also um

378
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:01,360
in person for us is important to meet

379
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,918
and to see each other and touch each

380
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,360
other

381
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:08,640
each other so for

382
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:13,199

417
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:07,039
um we also so yeah what we usually do

418
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,039
is the format is usually two weeks of

419
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,600
the cyber multiversity

420
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,879
which is like the other world's

421
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,080
university

422
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,880
uh that we call the workshops that we

423
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,840
have in different

424
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,360
spaces in the both in the city and in

425
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,879
the peripheria

426
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,918
and uh in the end we have a

427
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:32,400
a a weekend of performances function

428
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:35,520
fair and concerts and talks

429
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,480
so here you can see some of the pictures

430
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,440
of

431
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,679
our of our closing i think this was in

432
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,080
2018

433
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:49,360
probably 18 or

434
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:52,639
2019 and um

435
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:57,120
well as we said we also teach

436
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:00,240
alternative ways of gene ecology we have

437
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,760
dinner punk workshops

438
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,320
and bio biohacking workshops because we

439
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,799
believe

440
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:11,520
in reclaiming our bodies as technology

441
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,520
and so here are some images of the

442
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,000
transplant workshop we had with our

443
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:20,240
friends from kimura rosa back in

444
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,240
i think it was in 2018.

445
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,080
see also we have an area

446
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:32,080
a we receive video

447
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:36,639
it's called cyborg cinema

448
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:41,199
um see when

449
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:44,880
we have uh a good

450
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:48,080
selection from different countries

451
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:52,080
and and sometimes

452
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:54,960
when nellie and me go to another country

453
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,960
we bring these

454
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,840
cinemas to other places

455
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:06,080
[Music]

456
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:09,440
yeah so yeah cyber cinema is a way of

457
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,879
uh so if the girls that are

458
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,440
somewhere else in the world they can't

459
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,240
come

460
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,080
because we don't have funding really we

461
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,159
are self-sustained

462
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,760
and we don't really have sponsors or

463
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,240
anything so

464
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,280
this is a way that girls from all over

465
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,480
the world can

466
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,480
participate with us

467
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:33,360
[Music]

468
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,720
and well maybe

469
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:40,000
highlighting a little bit um

470
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:43,039
some of the of our communication

471
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,200
materials that

472
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:50,400
we use for the for every year

473
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,440
we collaborate with different

474
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,840
designers and illustrators

475
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,840
and

476
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,400
every year we change the image a little

477
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,159
bit

478
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,360
of the of the meeting but we always keep

479
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,799
the idea of the

480
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:12,399
cyborg influenced by donna hardaway's

481
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,400
idea of the cyborg

482
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,400
and

483
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,480
we also tried to do a little bit of merc

484
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:27,760
like a tote bags and shirts

485
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,240
and stuff like that to to maintain

486
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:34,480
ourselves

487
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:39,440
and um well constanza said

488
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:42,400
that you can check the

489
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,279
the archive we are building in in our

490
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,480
website

491
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:51,039
and yeah so

492
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:55,440
we had to postpone a meeting this year

493
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,440
right and um

494
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:01,279
but we've definitely

495
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,919
we definitely want to find a way to make

496
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:06,720
it because

497
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:10,400
right now we are around 160

498
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,919
cyber girls from 14 countries

499
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,480
so we've realized that this meeting is

500
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,840
really

501
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:22,000
necessary is

502
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:27,279
um is something that we need and we want

503
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,919
and that is a really um

504
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,120
i don't know that it fits our souls in a

505
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,559
way it sounds very

506
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,520
romantic but it's true we didn't have

507
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,440
this before

508
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:42,000
and we realized that that

509
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,440
building community is super super super

510
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,960
important

511
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,000
uh cyber girls for me is a very good

512
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:54,640
example of place making because

513
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:58,240
constantly we are a finding ways to meet

514
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:01,360
and to share and uh

515
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:05,279
it's hard to do so in the

516
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:09,360
in the current scenario right but

517
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:12,720
but we are a strong community

518
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,039
uh i mean uh proof of that is like

519
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,960
like the expectation that we have this

520
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,760
year and that the community had this

521
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,440
year to

522
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:24,960
for the meeting to happen and uh

523
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,320
so we are really just like waiting

524
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,919
for the moment to make it again

525
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:35,120
and uh yeah in the meantime just

526
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,120

530

nice thank you so much

531
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,960
that was really really uh insightful and

532
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,679
interesting it was uh

533
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,919
i was really drawn by this idea of

534
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,640
producing knowledge through the body

535
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,880
in guatemala uh where i'm from uh the

536
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,760
communitarian feminists talk about

537
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,320
um these two territories of defense the

538
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,559
the body territory and then the

539
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:22,000
land territory i was curious about

540
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:24,320
um in terms of technology what

541
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
how would you place that or tell it or

542
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,840
territorialize it

543
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,159
uh like thinking about it through the

544
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,559
body as an extension i guess

545
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,559
i don't know

546
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:44,000
um why were you can you repeat the

547
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:46,320
part of um

548
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,159
of uh as an extension of the body

549
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,039
technology as a section of the body you

550
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,840
were saying

551
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:53,080
yeah or also an extension of the land or

552
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,879
i don't know

553
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:58,240
exactly yeah as an extension of the land

554
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,520
like what happens with this

555
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,760
space that is the internet

556
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,400
like what do we have to do there we

557
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:10,158
definitely believe in reclaiming what

558
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,760
the free portion that is left of the

559
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,080
internet

560
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,080
um

561
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:26,799
we definitely think about this a lot

562
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:32,158
like uh and i was listening yesterday

563
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:32,158
to a lorena cabinet um

564
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,919
that she talks about this uh

565
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,439
the territory of the body and the

566
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,799
territory of the land

567
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,159
and how is this extended to the brutal

568
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,120
realm right it's a big

569
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,880
question for all of us and i think it's

570
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,479
something that we need to think about

571
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,480
because

572
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:58,640
you don't really think about like uh

573
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:01,679
uh as i don't know

574
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,799
a portion of land in

575
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:08,080
the internet as such

576
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,279
but i mean if you think of the servers

577
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,918
for example

578
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:18,080
and um and the physical space that the

579
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:21,600
whole infrastructure of the internet

580
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:24,720
takes it makes you want to have like

581
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,799
your own server i don't know like what

582
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,200
is the real autonomy

583
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:35,520
uh in in the virtual

584
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:38,960
see our world

585
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:42,840
a physical world is

586
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:46,399
we have a patriarchal

587
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,399
capitalism system

588
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:54,639
and if a

589
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,960
feminist community create an extension

590
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,159
of

591
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,159
our land on internet we can share

592
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,879
a little with the system inside of this

593
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,158
system

594
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:11,039
for that it's important to open

595
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,000
newest spaces for feminism civil

596
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:15,360
feminism

597
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:20,480
techno feminism trans feminism

598
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,479
because the other the world now

599
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:28,639
is collapsing humanity the humanity

600
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:32,080
and our way to live

601
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,080
in this planet is

602
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:42,080
is a damage no

603
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,320
is it's a continuous damage so

604
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,480
now for that we think important to

605
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,200
create spaces for

606
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,399
for women and non-binary people in on

607
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,399
internet and also

608
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,840
physical

609
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,559
yeah uh well yeah it's a so basically

610
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,080
how to think about this virtual

611
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,559
feudalism that is now

612
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,199
the internet and how to make it an

613
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:12,720
autonomous zone uh

614
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,480
very interesting question yeah i like

615
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,600
that concept that is just throwing

616
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,600
virtual so that isn't

617
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,159
yeah right because now we have all these

618
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,880
big amazons and the facebooks and

619
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,720
we're kind of like in their land and

620
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,919
they're just kind of extracting data

621
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,240
from us

622
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,760
um doesn't we don't own it right it

623
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,919
doesn't belong to us

624
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,840
uh it feels like like it's supposed to

625
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,200
be something free and the commons but

626
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,199
it's really not

627
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,520
uh we're just the we are the products

628
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,600
now so how do you reclaim that space

629
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,960
with this service with this

630
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,879
material infrastructures also uh that's

631
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,760
also always a question right

632
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,640
um and also you mentioned about uh

633
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,039
ginapunk

634
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,039
um this is done by uh a friend of ours

635
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,080
common friend whereas clown

636
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:04,158
yeah and uh i guess that's that's an

637
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,840
example i guess of how

638
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,200
how to also reclaim most of these

639
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,840
practices and knowledges

640
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,760
of the body and also like in a way that

641
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,519
is more autonomous i guess no

642
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,760
uh can you talk maybe a little bit more

643
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,080
about that uh to explain to people

644
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,519
you know what that is and how that works

645
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,080
for those who are not so familiar with

646
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,080
the concept

647
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
of

648
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:42,879
so this is a project the cloud kinky

649
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,440
our friend she participated in all the

650
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:51,760
version of cyborg here

651
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:55,919
she is doing

652
00:31:51,760 --> 00:32:02,559
diy violas

653
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:02,559
for a gynecological affection

654
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:09,360
and she is trying

655
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:13,640
to include natural

656
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:18,320
medicines and also she's doing diy

657
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,320
microscopy on hannon

658
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,158
um

659
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,720
she is doing

660
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:35,630
conversation about sexuality

661
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,360
and also about

662
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:41,440
[Music]

663
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:44,240
how we can take care by

664
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,240
ourselves

665
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,760
and she now is a

666
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:56,720
is has an open space on

667
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:59,840
facebook for people that have some a

668
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,360
problem you can ask

669
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,720
directly there and maybe she cannot

670
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,479
answer but

671
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,600
other people participating in this group

672
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:15,200
can share medicines

673
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:18,399
or or you can help others

674
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:21,679
in because

675
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:26,158
you know that um

676
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:28,210
the healthy system in not every country

677
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,960
country is good for

678
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:34,480
[Music]

679
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:37,919
for example for abortion

680
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,440
or no said there are a lot of

681
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,640
discrimination with

682
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:46,159
trans people and

683
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:49,919
so for that the gina pong

684
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:53,360
network is important on internet and

685
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:56,720
also out of internet we every

686
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:59,918
year have a space for hine punk

687
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,399
and laboratory then in

688
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,480
techno feminist meeting because we think

689
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:08,319
it's an important

690
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,320
space for everybody

691
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,000
i can

692
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,599
we have maybe this is related to a

693
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,639
question um that was asked

694
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,760
just now by julci which is uh how to

695
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,839
connect

696
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,599
ancestral technology and cyborg

697
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:29,040
technology

698
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:32,320
and also asking about the connection

699
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,199
and knowledge connection or synergy

700
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,079
between cyber

701
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,279
cyber feminists or cyber feminists or

702
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,399
cyber girls and

703
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,440
in indigenous communities so going back

704
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,399
to i guess also

705
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,720
what lorena cabinet was saying before

706
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:51,040
about the territory

707
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:54,719
yeah so let's think about binary code

708
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:57,839
like the base for contemporary

709
00:34:54,719 --> 00:35:01,040
computers uh

710
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,240
a constanza will probably depend on this

711
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,640
but

712
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:10,240
binary code is

713
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,279
based on ancestral knowledge

714
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,720
so and we have

715
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:20,480
the example of accounting systems

716
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:24,078
a ancestral accounting systems

717
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:28,000
that were also used to make

718
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:30,720
a the computers the computer programming

719
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,800
that we use nowadays so that is a very

720
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,799
direct link

721
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:40,079
between uh the

722
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:43,040
the knowledge of ancestral technology

723
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:46,880
and cyber technology

724
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:51,119
say also for example

725
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,119
this year during the

726
00:35:53,040 --> 00:36:01,200
hack feminist activity

727
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:04,480
the first weekend of cyber girl

728
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:07,520
we we meet in the

729
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,640
in a hacker space in la china by the

730
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,280
name

731
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:16,400
um and in the peripheral

732
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:20,160
mexico city and we

733
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:23,280
include a group of indigenous people

734
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:26,799
a woman that they

735
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:30,000
know and now what

736
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,119
now what is is a language all language

737
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,200
in mexico

738
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:38,400
indigenous language and

739
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,839
they we are trying to create

740
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:45,680
a goes using

741
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:47,480
now what because

742
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,769
almost all the

743
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,769
[Music]

744
00:36:51,839 --> 00:37:00,320
cold or a language for

745
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:04,319
programming start with english

746
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:07,520
and if you want to learn code

747
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,040
first you you have to learn english and

748
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,400
then

749
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:15,920
to understand not to learn coding

750
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:19,359
and they are changing this way and they

751
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:23,839
are trying to include other language and

752
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:27,359
in this workshop uh this group of

753
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:31,359
women they teach us

754
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:35,279
a number and we try to change

755
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:39,920
some words

756
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:43,200
and we try to include

757
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:47,440
this language to do

758
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:51,839
to do like coding or

759
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,839
i don't know in this moment we are

760
00:37:51,920 --> 00:38:01,359
we are trying to do like calling

761
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:04,720
so for for us it's important to

762
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:07,150
try to to change our

763
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,399
um our way to do

764
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:12,640
[Music]

765
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,119
um to use a software or hardware you

766
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,799
know

767
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,839
we are trying to include uh other

768
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,839
cosmo vision

769
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,680
that's very interesting

770
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:35,920
and about this binary code

771
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,920
is that create non-binary forms of code

772
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,598
that's a good question

773
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,078
like how to do non-binary forms of code

774
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,879
this

775
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,680
is i guess yeah maybe also on to this

776
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,839
question of

777
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,279
now a lot using the what now a laptop

778
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:00,720
form of coding

779
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,480
i don't know is there

780
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,078
i don't know is there such a thing as

781
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,079
analog coding

782
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:11,710
[Music]

783
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,800
yeah that's a very good idea

784
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,560
interesting yeah

785
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,720
let's see we'll check if there are any

786
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,320
other questions from the audience

787
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:31,118
not so far nice um

788
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,760
if not i will ask also like maybe a

789
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:37,599
final question and maybe you can also

790
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:40,160
uh yeah give some final reflections um

791
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,359
like what what do you think is the

792
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,879
biggest challenge

793
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:46,960
in in organizing uh

794
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,680
i guess before corona is now adding the

795
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,880
corona pandemic is also a bit more

796
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:56,040
complex but how how to get

797
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,920
this this this practices this

798
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,759
epistemologies these forms of

799
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,760
organization also

800
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:06,480
um into the general mind of people

801
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,440
uh how to how to hack the the culture

802
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,760
let's say

803
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,119
uh because that's what you're doing in

804
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,640
the way like for me it was very

805
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,760
inspiring to hear you so

806
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,759
what do you what are the biggest

807
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,400
challenges you think in actually facing

808
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,800
these

809
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,880
big uh structures like the patriarchal

810
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:25,839
structures the capitalist structures

811
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,839
how to hack that uh

812
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:29,969
[Music]

813
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,839
well i think one of the biggest

814
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,079
challenges is to make it sustainable

815
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:40,720
to make the meeting sustainable in a way

816
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,720
because

817
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:52,800
well we do it all ourselves

818
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:56,000
and we have a team of

819
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,520
about five people that are like

820
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,520
deep on it besides

821
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:07,040
all the the the

822
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:09,680
workshop presenters and

823
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,960
the people that give talks and

824
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,399
everything

825
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,960
but at the core is like we are a group

826
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,240
of

827
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:21,760
a limited group of a group of uh

828
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,319
not so many people uh it's not so much

829
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,440
maybe about the amount of people but

830
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,960
rather

831
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:32,800
um the time because

832
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:36,480
we all have like side jobs to these

833
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:39,520
and uh and

834
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:43,040
the and so like we need to make

835
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:46,960
time uh to organize the meeting in

836
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:50,880
the meeting and it's like extra work so

837
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,160
like in a way we try to escape

838
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,300
to the to the um

839
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,299
[Music]

840
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:06,720
to the limitations let's say

841
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:09,279
of a the capitalist world

842
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,359
but we are still in it so we need to

843
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,640
balance out right

844
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:17,920
like we need to like find time to do

845
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,839
the meeting things that take the

846
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,200
feminist meeting things and also the

847
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:25,200
other things

848
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:28,960
um it's like this problem with uh

849
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:33,118
like the issue with um

850
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:36,720
the home workers let's say

851
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,560
like you know they work in a they have a

852
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,959
full-time job but when they get home

853
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,920
they also have this other job which is

854
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,400
working

855
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,760
at their home and it's not seen as a as

856
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,560
a work

857
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,760
so i don't know for me that's one

858
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,040
challenge

859
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,040
how about you constanza

860
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,640
no i'm thinking about

861
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,319
thing i say i don't know for me now it's

862
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:06,799
difficult to sing

863
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,800
um because

864
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:14,480
pandemia changed the world

865
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:17,760
eating one day yeah

866
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:21,200
all our expectatives all our

867
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,079
plans change so for me now it's

868
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,520
difficult

869
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:29,920
to think in solutions or

870
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:32,960
say i don't know now i am trying to

871
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:37,040
to to be quiet and

872
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,599
listen just this i have no answer for a

873
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:43,599
lot of things now

874
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:47,040
because every day the thing changed and

875
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,040
it's difficult to think about

876
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,599
yeah yeah and in

877
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,720
taiwan how is the situation now is it

878
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,280
also

879
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,560
a lot of things happening with purana or

880
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,520
this is more like

881
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,520
like okay or

882
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,839
mm-hmm

883
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,880
no because they closed the border in the

884
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:29,040
beginning of the

885
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:32,400
pandemia and now they have any case

886
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:36,240
but they are extremely strict

887
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,200
when when you enter you have to be in

888
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,319
quarantine

889
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:44,240
during two weeks in a hotel

890
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,240
a special hotel so

891
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,040
no

892
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,319
no it's not problematic situation

893
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,970

894
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,069
