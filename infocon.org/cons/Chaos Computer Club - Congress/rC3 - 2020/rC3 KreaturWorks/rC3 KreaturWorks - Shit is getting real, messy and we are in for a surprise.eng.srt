1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:09,320
[Music]

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:14,080
[Applause]

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,080
[Laughter]

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,359
different things

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,640
um often at the intersection of

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,920
ecology and technology and asking

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,560
questions about

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,599
innovation but that's not actually

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,600
really what i

10
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,000
yeah that's not the focus of tonight

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,079
tonight i was quite inspired

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,840
um by the premise of solar punk of

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,399
really talking about how we bring things

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,480
into reality because that's really at

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,399
the core of a lot of my projects and

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,839
what i've found is that

17
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:55,280
um once things get into reality they get

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,360
messy and beautiful and

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,480
complicated in ways that there's

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,760
actually no

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,839
no way to imagine until you do it

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,280
but without further ado um i'm gonna

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,640
introduce the first

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,799
work uh so this is human cheese

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,479
it's cheese made from human milk

26
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,040
and it's pictured in front of its urban

27
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,759
pasture so kind of the premise of the

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,040
of the project was you know in a city uh

29
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,040
of 8 million people

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,799
which so this this work was 10 years ago

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,960
i don't i can't account for the new york

32
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,600
city population at this time but in a

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,600
city of 8 million people and not one cow

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,199
maybe it's more kind of local and

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,520
natural

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,320
uh to be eating cheese made from human

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,320
milk

38
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:45,039
so this was an idea that i had

39
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:48,960
and uh that started actually really as a

40
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:52,399
response to the rise to kind of the two

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:56,079
um movements that were happening side by

42
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,680
side in 2009 2009-2011

43
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,199
um which is around the time this work

44
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,719
was happening so in new york

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,200
it was the rise of the local

46
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,158
food movement um and i remember going to

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,199
a farmers market

48
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,759
and uh they're being you know you could

49
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,839
buy

50
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,839
your meat from the farmer's market and

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,400
there was like a picture of the farmer

52
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,599
with the cow tapes of the table where

53
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,760
you're buying your meat from

54
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,440
um and at the same time there was a lot

55
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,480
of stuff in the news

56
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,879
um about human

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,679
women when renting their wombs

58
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,560
especially

59
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,200
in poorer countries to richer people

60
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,160
that

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,160
were implanting their

62
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,879
uh eggs into into these women and these

63
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,239
women were bringing these babies to term

64
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,679
and there was like some

65
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,000
some debate around the ethics of this

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,200
but

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,640
um mostly it was just happening and it's

68
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,319
still just happening although some

69
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,480
countries have now

70
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,440
uh started to ban or at least regulate

71
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,879
the ways in which this

72
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,560
can happen and so i just became really

73
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,679
interested in how

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,720
we decide um

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,560
which kind of human bioavailabilities we

76
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,200
are okay with using selling buying

77
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,159
trading

78
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,720
eating uh [ __ ] uh uh

79
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,200
you know using to make babies and which

80
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,400
things remain taboo

81
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,640
and how we decide um what that is so

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,920
that was how this this idea came

83
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,319
uh i want to make cheese from human

84
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,958
knock and um and kind of quite let's say

85
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,359
a critical

86
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,239
from quite a critical standpoint but

87
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,319
thankfully

88
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,080
i wasn't i really wanted to actually do

89
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,879
it um instead of kind of

90
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,400
faking it or making a video or uh making

91
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,359
a bunch of symbols which is

92
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,159
sometimes in the art world one way that

93
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,560
things happen

94
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,679
i i did really want to do it so what did

95
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,560
i do i went

96
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,480
to try to see where i could get human

97
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,840
milk and i went to the same place i

98
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,679
used to go get everything which is

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,200
craigslist um and i was really lucky

100
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,239
because i think normally on christ

101
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,200
this is not always available but just in

102
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,879
the moment that i

103
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,879
was trying to figure out if this is even

104
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,399
possible um i found this

105
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,920
ad um so breast milk for sale two

106
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
dollars two dollars an ounce is actually

107
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,200
pretty

108
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:16,478
cheap even 10 years ago um

109
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,039
so in the end i didn't end up using the

110
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,918
the craigslist source but what i did

111
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,759
find

112
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:27,359
um in an effort to to get this

113
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:32,320
stuff uh was the gray market online for

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,320
human breast milk so uh

115
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,320
buy good like buy going yeah so again by

116
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,400
by

117
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,000
needing to make this video finding this

118
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,638
online great market i started to

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,360
understand

120
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,000
that there's like an entire political

121
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,280
rich

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,919
and interesting and complicated

123
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,159
political history behind

124
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,359
the selling and trading of human milk so

125
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,759
wet nurse is

126
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,560
one of the oldest professions alongside

127
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,120
with prostitution um

128
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,960
but the selling of like milk itself

129
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,720
unattached to the

130
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,400
kind of renting of the woman that's

131
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,560
producing it uh

132
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,638
is pretty new and it is this gray market

133
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,600
because unlike human organs which are

134
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,880
regulated it's

135
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,960
definitely illegal to sell and trade um

136
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,000
in the u.s which is where this project

137
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,638
was done

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,560
uh human milk is not regulated but it's

139
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,360
also not approved by the fda so it's

140
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,360
technically uh

141
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,960
you can get in trouble for selling it um

142
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,159
especially like uh with the normal food

143
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,479
establishments

144
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,320
but this kind of online trade is in this

145
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,520
legal gray area

146
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,800
um and so yeah this is the

147
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,560
this is actually the screenshot from

148
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,840
this website now you can

149
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,919
exist you can go browse around on it um

150
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,198
as you can see by the marketing now it's

151
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,960
quite interesting ten years later

152
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,479
they've made it quite more wholesome so

153
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,080
when it first came out

154
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,440
there definitely was uh and is a market

155
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,800
among

156
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,039
people that adopt um kids or

157
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,960
uh people that can't breastfeed that

158
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,199
have babies for a variety of reasons but

159
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,318
there's also a pretty wide variety of

160
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,400
other uses

161
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,160
so you can see here like men buying

162
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,440
breast milk usually kind of fetish

163
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,039
situations

164
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,960
um i don't know that there's

165
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,639
yeah there's also they don't have a

166
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,680
special section for it currently but

167
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,319
there's like

168
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,319
bodybuilders that um believe in the use

169
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,240
of breast milk

170
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,080
to help them along uh people with

171
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,080
different forms of cancer that are

172
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,440
interested in the immuno properties of

173
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,719
breast milk so there's kind of a wide

174
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,719
variety of reasons

175
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,240
uh that women are selling milk and what

176
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,720
is even more interesting is

177
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,319
um you have these women that are

178
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,120
marketing themselves right so there's

179
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,240
really

180
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,360
different marketing strategies that that

181
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,919
the women using this website use whether

182
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,599
it's like

183
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,680
as you can see healthy diet no drinking

184
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,919
no smoking or drugs um and you can see

185
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,720
me

186
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,758
with my baby or like more sexualized

187
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,840
images

188
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,360
um that are probably have a little bit

189
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,638
of a different audience

190
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,680
to all this kind of like yeah vegan

191
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:11,599
hyper vegan um

192
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,960
breast milk for sale so i used um

193
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,800
this site and then actually just word of

194
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,599
mouth to collect

195
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,400
uh to buy actually the milk of three

196
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,880
different women

197
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,479
and i used it to make three different

198
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,199
cheeses so one thing

199
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:32,719
that i encountered along the way um

200
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:35,360
yeah so here's like literally the

201
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,720
email exchange that i had once i posted

202
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,080
on the website that i was looking for

203
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,120
some milk

204
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,318
um one

205
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,560
kind of big concern that i had because i

206
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,000
was actually interested in

207
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,120
offering people this to eat or to see if

208
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,240
they would eat it

209
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,240
um and to like certainly have it readily

210
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,400
available right not as a again not as a

211
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,160
thought experiment but as a

212
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:06,159
like smelly cheesy

213
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:09,440
hopefully tasty substance that

214
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:13,599
was confronting them in this way that

215
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,080
um that proved to be uh really powerful

216
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,960
in shifting what people thought their

217
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,318
reactions would be

218
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,919
in both directions right um

219
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,080
but one of the things was that of course

220
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,240
like breast milk uh

221
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,840
is the one way that we can communicate

222
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,120
human diseases

223
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,640
um so things like uh hiv

224
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,560
and yeah basically any any disease that

225
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,080
can be communicated

226
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,518
um through blood can usually be

227
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,399
communicated through breast milk as well

228
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,719
so that became

229
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,159
a really big concern so one of the

230
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,200
things that i actually asked for

231
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,399
was blood tests from the women that i

232
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,680
was buying

233
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,519
um milk from so this is uh

234
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,519
later in an exhibition kind of a

235
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,760
portrait of a mother right so it's one

236
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,279
one portrait of a mother is just a

237
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,720
readout

238
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,600
of her blood test depending on uh what

239
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,360
is important to you to know about so i'm

240
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,040
kind of interested like in

241
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:14,080
within a more art historical uh context

242
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,040
like what does this mean as portraiture

243
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,640
but that's um but but it came from like

244
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,760
a very real

245
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,000
uh problem that i really didn't want to

246
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,439
get

247
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,200
anyone sick um there's also of course

248
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,320
the issue of trust and i was extra

249
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,519
scared

250
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,760
so i did double boil the milk which also

251
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,160
just kills any diseases which cheese

252
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,640
makers were really upset about

253
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,480
because by doing that you're killing off

254
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,800
of course a lot of bacteria

255
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,240
um which is kind of like the essence of

256
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,439
what makes

257
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,720
cheese unique and special and cheese um

258
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,920
but that was the call i made um this is

259
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,040
just like some

260
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,560
fun um surveys that i

261
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,240
asked the women to fill out around like

262
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,119
what color food they eat

263
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,920
why they decided to do that uh yeah like

264
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,120
basic

265
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,800
kind of height weight age profession

266
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,560
just thinking about like what is the

267
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,959
information that

268
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,760
you would want to know um about the

269
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,079
person

270
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,800
that you're consuming food from their

271
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,279
body

272
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,800
um and of course perhaps that raises the

273
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,480
question of like what is the information

274
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,640
that you do or do not know

275
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,600
about the other animals from whose

276
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:29,439
bodies you consume food

277
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,279
um and then i uh

278
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,880
i actually really try to find a cheese

279
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,160
maker to make this cheese

280
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,200
because cheese making is a art of its

281
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,160
own

282
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,360
and not one that i was familiar with but

283
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,199
cheese makers

284
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,720
really didn't want to touch me with a

285
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,000
10-foot pole because they were actually

286
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,920
in the midst of their own political

287
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,760
fight um precisely around like

288
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,760
pasteurized milk and wanting to use

289
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,640
unpasteurized milk to make more fancy

290
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,360
cheeses

291
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,199
um so i had to learn to make the cheese

292
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,240
myself which again i think

293
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:04,079
was actually uh

294
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:07,040
quite beneficial to understanding what

295
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,839
this thing was because i do have to be

296
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,640
honest

297
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,880
you know i was like in this project

298
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,800
found this milk

299
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,240
reading a lot talking a lot to people

300
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,640
really clear and

301
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,720
fine with what i was doing and then i

302
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,160
like had the milk and had to start

303
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:27,120
you know sterilizing it and the smell

304
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,800
was uh in the beginning like totally

305
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,920
nauseating and like that might be

306
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,000
psychological that might be

307
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,680
physiological is probably a mix

308
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,519
but of course it's like super

309
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,680
interesting um

310
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,920
that yeah again like that by doing it

311
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,880
all of these ideas that i had just went

312
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,560
out the window

313
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,439
because i was not cautious

314
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,279
um making this stuff but the good thing

315
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,079
is is that i had to do it a lot and so

316
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,680
basically

317
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,359
very quick kind of quite quickly i got

318
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,160
used to it i stopped being nauseous

319
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,000
um i got over it um but of course like

320
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,279
this

321
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,680
um like this boundary

322
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,200
or something this like biophysical

323
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,880
reaction that i had

324
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,720
maybe it was purely emotional but like

325
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,519
manifested physically

326
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,480
um gave me a lot of food for thought

327
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,279
around

328
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,480
how taboos are established how taboos

329
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,040
get

330
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,639
implanted in your body um yeah just

331
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,160
things that there would not have been

332
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,800
access to if i hadn't actually been

333
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,959
forced to cook this stuff in my kitchen

334
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:33,199
um so one thing for the bio

335
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,719
people out there so human milk is a

336
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,600
little tricky it actually does not

337
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,839
coagulate

338
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,000
um as well as other

339
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,519
mammal milk so this is like pure human

340
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,200
milk coagulation so you can see it's

341
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,160
like sticky enough that it's not

342
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,839
running through my finger but it doesn't

343
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,360
it's all like little bits and it doesn't

344
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,200
um collapse into a single mass so

345
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,920
actually all of the cheeses i made were

346
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,200
human cow human goat blends which in the

347
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,959
beginning was kind of

348
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,959
a compromise um i really wanted it to be

349
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,719
100 pure and there are like possible

350
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,800
ways to do that

351
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,320
inc that are basically just require

352
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,279
expensive equipment like molecular

353
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,560
sieves um

354
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:17,920
or pressure boilers but in the end

355
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,760
again uh i actually then realized

356
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,560
it's almost more interesting right so

357
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,800
uh yeah it's like places the human and

358
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,959
the other mammal quite evenly in the

359
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,279
same i mean we eat like sheep goat blend

360
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,599
or sheep cow blend all the time

361
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,920
um or even like bacon wrapped cheese

362
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,519
right so

363
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,479
uh yeah again like through

364
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,480
being forced to

365
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,920
have to make a piece of cheese like the

366
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,599
the project got even more complicated

367
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,959
and then of course you saw like

368
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,880
different reactions and what

369
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,359
people wanted to eat if they were like

370
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,199
more drawn to the human cow or the human

371
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,399
goat reaction um the the kind of project

372
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,399
itself was also

373
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,639
posited a little bit less in the news

374
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,680
media a little bit less as an artwork

375
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:11,360
and more as a viable product um

376
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:15,120
especially you know piggybacking off of

377
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,880
like sustainable local circular economy

378
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,240
kind of ideas that were just becoming

379
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,560
popular at the moment

380
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,079
so this is just like the life cycle

381
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,719
analysis of making

382
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,479
of me making cumin cheese so you have

383
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,600
the woman pumping the milk and then i

384
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,960
was taking the subway

385
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,279
to transport the milk cooking

386
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,720
[Music]

387
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,079
uh making the cheese using transport to

388
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,079
distribute the cheese eating the cheese

389
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,319
digesting the cheese excreting

390
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,680
the cheese and then kind of looking at

391
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,160
all the infection points at which

392
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,359
these processes affect the food air and

393
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,120
water quality

394
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,959
that the woman then consumes that then

395
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,320
goes into her body and goes into the

396
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,518
milk goes into the

397
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,639
cheese and yeah continues in this way so

398
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,040
human milk is one of the

399
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,320
biggest ways that industrial pollutants

400
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,040
that end up in bodies

401
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,760
uh get expelled because the pollutants

402
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:11,279
often lodge themselves inside the fat

403
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,000
um and yeah milk is one of the best ways

404
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,760
to actually like

405
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,199
remove uh stuff from fat um and so there

406
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,600
was just a question there

407
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,399
around like i don't know do we begin to

408
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,839
care more

409
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,320
about the pollutants entering our

410
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,600
neighbors bodies if we are eating cheese

411
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,399
that they make with them

412
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,399
but like i said in the beginning i was

413
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,240
really committed and interested

414
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:39,120
in being able to serve this cheese

415
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,120
and having people

416
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,040
come to the same maybe inflection point

417
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,120
that i did with my

418
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,800
initial nausea or not um

419
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,399
this work was actually i mean it's like

420
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,758
one of my first works and it was

421
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,880
initially

422
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:59,279
uh a thesis work at nyu

423
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,279
so it was shown in this like um

424
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,839
exhibition at nyu as a work in progress

425
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,920
and the lawyers

426
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,880
for nyu i mean it was a big debate that

427
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,719
lasted a month

428
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,959
and then in the end the lawyers said

429
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,480
okay you can have the cheese on display

430
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,758
but it needs to be covered

431
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,839
in uh like a glass

432
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,120
or a plastic glass container so that

433
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,160
nobody by accident

434
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,079
can ingest this cheese um which of

435
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,040
course in and of itself is like

436
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,719
yeah totally crazy so this is uh we we

437
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,319
cheated a bit and took the plastic off

438
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,120
and kind of took this photo but this is

439
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,060
the way

440
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,839
that it was presented in this um

441
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,959
[Music]

442
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,800
initial work in progress show but

443
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,680
ultimately i opened

444
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,560
um kind of an art exhibit but in a

445
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,719
low-key

446
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,560
gallery not in a gallery neighborhood

447
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,959
like just a little storefront that was

448
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,880
in between a wine shop and a bodega

449
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,239
um called the lady cheese shop and i was

450
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,880
really playing with

451
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,519
whether this was real or not and because

452
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,720
the

453
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:04,559
because it involved boobs

454
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,919
i think uh it got a lot of media

455
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,359
attention so it was featured like in

456
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,240
metro which is the newspaper that they

457
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,639
give out in the

458
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,240
in subway um so we got a lot of

459
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,280
attention and it got a lot of attention

460
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,120
more or less

461
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:20,000
as a cheese shop and not so much as an

462
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,039
art project which was for me at the time

463
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,439
really interesting

464
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,359
um so just briefly on the right you see

465
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,480
two of the different cheeses

466
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,799
those are all three of the different

467
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,760
cheeses that we serve from three

468
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:34,320
different women

469
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:37,600
um so they are served with accoutrements

470
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,678
that are inspired by the terroir of each

471
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,120
woman so tarawa is this really

472
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:46,240
um cheesy cheese term

473
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:50,000
uh wine term as well of course but it

474
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:53,200
is this kind of invented um

475
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,400
cultural invention to naturalize

476
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,480
certain um elements of

477
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,799
culture i mean like one of the biggest

478
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,320
ways it's used is in france for all

479
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,720
sorts of like legal

480
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,399
claims over champagne being called

481
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,720
champagne being only from a specific

482
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,880
place but basically the idea is that the

483
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,160
very specific microbes

484
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:17,440
culture and environment of a place

485
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,919
affects the taste of the cheese right so

486
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,600
like this

487
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,440
this cheese can really only be produced

488
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,360
in this tiny little village

489
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,640
otherwise it's something else so i was

490
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,719
interested in this idea

491
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,080
um and kind of played a lot with the

492
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,919
women's biographies

493
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,360
where they were from and what they did

494
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,000
for a living and what kind of

495
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,600
person they were to choose which cheese

496
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,720
i made with their milk and also like

497
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,678
what were the

498
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,039
so these are pickles pickled in human

499
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,200
way and these are like

500
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,799
cheese curds for the woman from

501
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,520
wisconsin

502
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,039
um and then yeah we had a blue cheese

503
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,720
with a woman that really loved blue

504
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,400
cheese and also worked with a chef

505
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,600
so and like ate oatmeal cookies every

506
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,320
day so we had oat crackers and apple

507
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,799
apple jam so yeah it was this kind of

508
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,918
also

509
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,918
a bit playing with the

510
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:09,360
intense foodism of the moment

511
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:13,840
this is a line for the cheese shop

512
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:16,399
in the east village um and then

513
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,918
it's a dialogue uh i mean like this

514
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,039
project in particular i was actually

515
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,520
interested in

516
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:26,879
people's responses um so dialogue became

517
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,480
a part of the work in and of itself

518
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,919
and that happened through a number of

519
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,200
different ways so

520
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,799
on top you have the the like just these

521
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,720
really simple comment cards that

522
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,480
i would give people at different

523
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,039
exhibitions and tastings and

524
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,720
things that i was doing that is really

525
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,799
simple just ask you questions like how

526
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,120
was it and what's next

527
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,320
um so this is one of the one of the

528
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,760
answers

529
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,360
um and i just thought it was really

530
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,200
interesting that like this person

531
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,918
answered you know what's next mass

532
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,400
production question mark question mark

533
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,400
human farming um and then i also like i

534
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,600
said that this work did get a lot of

535
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,159
news attention um so this is

536
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,639
an interview i did a live interview i

537
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,200
did on

538
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,960
sun tv which is kind of the canadian

539
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,440
version of fox news

540
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,360
um where they also kind of had the thing

541
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,320
under me saying human farming

542
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,600
um which which was in some ways

543
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,720
precisely the

544
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,918
question that i was interested in um but

545
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,640
some other things that happened along

546
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,000
the way that

547
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,520
that really surprised me i mean like

548
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,039
like i said i started this i think as a

549
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,200
really dystopic

550
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,320
work and like in the process first

551
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,240
working with these women that were

552
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,559
really excited that i was using

553
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,919
um their milk either because i was

554
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,600
buying it but some of them it wasn't

555
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,640
really for the money they just like

556
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,000
you know they pump this substance

557
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,600
with labor from their own body

558
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,960
and their baby can't consume all of it

559
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,719
and they like literally just can't bring

560
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,559
themselves to throw it away so they

561
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,000
you know maybe thought it was a little

562
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,399
weird but um

563
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
we're just like happy it was being used

564
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,520
or like the breast milk

565
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,600
breastfeeding advocates that i

566
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,200
encountered that were like super gung-ho

567
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,639
about the whole work because they

568
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,840
thought it was

569
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,840
normalizing and making you know

570
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:19,280
making human milk

571
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,399
more of a food than maybe uh

572
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:26,559
like this taboo thing

573
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:31,440
um so with that i'm just gonna show one

574
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:34,480
video um

575
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:44,960
that is um yeah just

576
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:48,400
one of the women that i worked with

577
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,400
i'm 36 years old i live in chelsea um i

578
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,840
grew up in new jersey i have two kids

579
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:59,840
my daughter's two and a half and my son

580
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:59,840
is eight months old

581
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,559
i have a pretty uh i eat most everything

582
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,000
i ate a fair amount of meat i like a lot

583
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,639
of vegetables i'm not

584
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,840
a huge fan of fruit i love pasta because

585
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,559
i used to cook pasta

586
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,360
in a restaurant so i eat a lot of pasta

587
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,360
and i love cheese

588
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:27,840
it's my favorite thing what's your

589
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:27,840
favorite kind of tea gorgonzola

590
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,840
i don't eat that many sweets except for

591
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,520
cookies in the afternoon

592
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:40,000
i drink coffee i drink tea i drink water

593
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,400
and i drink wine

594
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,840
i eat meat um i usually try and buy

595
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,039
organic meat

596
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:50,240
um or like grass-fed pastured meat which

597
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:53,039
i get from my local csa

598
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,440
pumping because i often pump when i have

599
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,679
to

600
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,039
like if i have too much milk so i

601
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,919
compare it to like when you really have

602
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,039
to go to the bathroom and then you

603
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,039
finally get to go to the bathroom

604
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,320
well i was uncertain about the whole

605
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,639
breastfeeding thing and then it came so

606
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,678
easily to me i have a friend who

607
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,280
described it as

608
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,840
like it gave her so much confidence as a

609
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,280
mother and you really feel like

610
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,039
sort of accomplished like look what i've

611
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,520
done i've fed this baby

612
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,520
you know and you can see the baby's

613
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,080
growing so much and you're not feeding

614
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,480
it anything

615
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,840
else so you know what because like you

616
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,919
never think about your breasts that way

617
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,280
at all until you suddenly start doing it

618
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,559
and then you're like oh well

619
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,200
and then it's hard to think about them

620
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:36,000
in any other way once you stop

621
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,919
like now i think of them these very

622
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,640
functional

623
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,640
sort of organs

624
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,200
i don't know what struck me like what

625
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,200
prompted me to participate

626
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,799
rather than just read about it i think

627
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,840
probably just because i produce so much

628
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,600
milk and

629
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,439
i'm not really interested in donating it

630
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,760
because there's so many restrictions

631
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,440
that i'm i don't know i want to be able

632
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:04,400
to eat what i want to eat and stuff

633
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:06,159
so oh it just seemed like a i tend to

634
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,240
volunteer for things

635
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,200
so it's sort of in my nature it freaks

636
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,120
me out a little bit

637
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,039
like i definitely that that part of it

638
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,918
i'm like that's weird like who would

639
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,919
want to do that

640
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,840
cheese makers maybe that doesn't bother

641
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,360
me like if people are just really into

642
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,279
cheese and doing it as a cheese

643
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,399
learning experience people are really

644
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:33,840
into breast milk

645
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:33,840
that kind of freaks me out

646
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,400
i think the regulations that would come

647
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,760
out of it if it became sort of a mass

648
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,960
thing would be very disturbing because

649
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,000
it would be regulating women and what

650
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,600
they were doing in their own homes and

651
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,279
what they were eating and it's just

652
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,760
complete you can imagine completely

653
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,600
creepy regulations coming out of it

654
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,120
i don't know it just reminds me i took a

655
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,320
a really interesting class in law school

656
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,840
about the regulation of pornography

657
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,799
and it started to get into this whole

658
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,399
like protecting women from themselves

659
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,400
and and you could see the debate going

660
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,760
down sort of the same path of like what

661
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,960
should we let women do with their bodies

662
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,480
and not let them do with their bodies

663
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,360
and how much should the government

664
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,000
be involved in that decision i don't

665
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,279
know i don't feel like uh

666
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,360
i mean i guess you have the the thing

667
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,000
that like only women can do it

668
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,600
and typically women selling things

669
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,600
related to their bodies has become

670
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,678
a big ethical issue but i think of it

671
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,918
more as like a

672
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,080
like a labor rather than a commodity and

673
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,520
having been in a labor industry like

674
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,158
cooking i feel like it's not all that

675
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,000
different

676
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,440
i feel like it's kind of the same as me

677
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,360
sort of

678
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,600
spending an hour making someone a pasta

679
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:48,000
or something like that

680
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,199
so i had to spend a lot of time with

681
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,559
that person

682
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:57,600
in order to get them to talk

683
00:25:52,559 --> 00:26:00,799
that openly with me on the video

684
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,360
um and i thought of

685
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,799
um i mean i guess like yeah it's

686
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,918
interesting to

687
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:11,679
to watch that now um

688
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:15,360
that final point which i think is

689
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,840
one of the most important things that i

690
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,918
learned

691
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,760
through this whole process thinking

692
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,480
about like what if we think about human

693
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,559
milk as a

694
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,279
labor rather than a commodity um

695
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,320
is kind of precisely everything about

696
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,520
making it real

697
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,639
because this like beginning idea that is

698
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:37,279
just dystopian and

699
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,679
kind of questioning position that i had

700
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,320
around like why do we have taboos around

701
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,960
this

702
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,678
um human bioproducts and not this other

703
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,840
one

704
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,799
how do we negotiate and regulate that

705
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,879
and where does medicalization come in

706
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,600
is kind of not the point right like the

707
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,799
point is what kind of labor

708
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:00,000
does producing all of these

709
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,720
um bio products i guess you can call

710
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,840
them

711
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,679
entail um like physical physiological

712
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,799
emotional all sorts and and yeah and

713
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,039
that and arriving

714
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,879
there was only through like the step by

715
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,320
step by step by step of actually doing

716
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,320
this thing

717
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:22,158
um okay uh i'm gonna talk about

718
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:25,200
um another another work

719
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:28,559
and that's a little bit quicker

720
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,360
uh yeah so i did this

721
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:34,000
um artist residency uh in santa fe art

722
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,559
institutes um

723
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,760
and the the residency was around food

724
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,480
justice

725
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,480
um

726
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,880
uh actually yeah i'm gonna do a quick

727
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,720
introduction it was around food justice

728
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,520
um and i arrived at the residency in new

729
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,120
mexico it's a state in the u.s

730
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,158
it's a state that where you can carry a

731
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,080
concealed weapon a gun without a license

732
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,640
so as a result of that because of

733
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,720
insurance um

734
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,240
the space where i was to live and work

735
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,840
which was also a public

736
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,200
um space where they had exhibitions um

737
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,199
because it was a public space they had

738
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,399
to put a sign on the door

739
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,840
that said like no guns and i had arrived

740
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,719
after a really long travel

741
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,439
quite tired and and from a part of the

742
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,320
country that

743
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,960
guns are not so prevalent um and was

744
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,200
just like quite

745
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,559
freaked out by this uh that i was living

746
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,679
in a place where they had to like put a

747
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,480
sticker on the door

748
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,440
asking people not bring guns inside um

749
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,200
but i i

750
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,279
was born in the us and have an american

751
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,240
passport and so

752
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,720
uh i guess it was my time to reckon with

753
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
that

754
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,760
um and at the same time so i was doing

755
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,039
this food justice residency

756
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,279
um and the people are just working on

757
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,080
all

758
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,600
kinds of different things like um food

759
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,600
inside of jails or

760
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,918
the tpp the trade agreement that was

761
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,840
going to really affect farmers in asia

762
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,120
um all kinds of really interesting

763
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,559
topics um

764
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,039
but all of them really thinking about

765
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,440
justice from a human

766
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,158
point of view justice for humans and i

767
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,559
really started

768
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,279
thinking about like what about justice

769
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,760
uh

770
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,120
for the animals that we eat because i

771
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,360
was at that time

772
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:15,360
a meat-eater and kind of

773
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,240
struggling with it um but also not

774
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,000
examining it

775
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,760
so that i could just keep happily eating

776
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,840
it um and then

777
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,120
so i i kind of took this again like

778
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,639
conflation of

779
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,760
happenstance to realize that i was gonna

780
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,120
like learn what it was

781
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,600
to be an american or like to be a person

782
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:37,120
from the us but to be this american

783
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,639
um and learn what it was to

784
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,360
to kill what i ate by my own hand right

785
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,039
we are all

786
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,158
uh if if we consume animal products

787
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,039
we're all killing just

788
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,919
we're having somebody else do it for us

789
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,080
um

790
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,960
and i really began this project thinking

791
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,480
i would not

792
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,080
i would be able to do it because i can

793
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,679
make myself do almost anything

794
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,520
if it's under the guise of an art

795
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,320
practice no matter how much i don't want

796
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,120
to

797
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,720
um but like thinking i would hate it and

798
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,000
become a vegetarian

799
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:13,840
um but what i found along the way

800
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,039
was something uh really really different

801
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,279
so uh the the end result of this work is

802
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:21,600
an exhibition that includes i can show

803
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,640
quickly the slides um

804
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,439
yeah a series of images that are shot

805
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,440
through

806
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:32,080
with various caliber bullets um

807
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,640
and some other some other works that

808
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,279
involve

809
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,960
kind of animal some paintings that are

810
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,080
shot through with bullets

811
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:44,080
um and some various other animal

812
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:48,320
animal parts um sculptures that i

813
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,320
can show in a bit but um at the core is

814
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,799
really

815
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,679
film that's uh almost 20 minutes i won't

816
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,080
show it here

817
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,360
it's called imagine lines and alibis um

818
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,639
it's a film that i made

819
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:03,279
uh on the process of learning to hunt um

820
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,480
hunt and kill and and skin and butcher

821
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,120
and cook

822
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,519
um to jack rabbits um but i have a kind

823
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,799
of

824
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,919

around

841
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,360
to hunt this to be twisted together

842
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,880

intricate patterns in the map dictate

848
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,559
places for living and dying

849
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,678
breathe evenly and slowly to get a clean

850
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,600
shot

851
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,679
women tend to be better shots they don't

852
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,399
get so excited are more efficient in

853
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,399
their calm

854
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,360
that pig was the only one we found in

855
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,120
eight weeks had to settle for jackrabbit

856
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,120
you look like lara croft the tomb raider

857
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,360
he says i wonder

858
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,678
do you envision yourself as a superhero

859
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:37,279
every time you hold this semi-automatic

860
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,279
or is it just my ponytail

861
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,000
steady on the reservation kidneys are

862
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,080
tied to branches for

863
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,760
birds but here on public land we just

864
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,039
throw the warm rabbit cuts into the

865
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,000
brush

866
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:52,080
seven weeks of four am starts staring

867
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,640
and scanning out that truck window so

868
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,279
hard my eyeballs hurt

869
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,120
suddenly all qualms go out that very

870
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,799
same window i just really want to kill

871
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,719
the [ __ ] thing

872
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,200
where is a carrot when you need one

873
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,720
against regulation not fair chase

874
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,559
what a way to regulate bodies and

875
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,480
species out here in the wild or is it

876
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,039
the great american west

877
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,880
fair chase for the ethical kill you

878
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,799
can't prop your 22 on the car door for

879
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,360
stability but you can blow the beams of

880
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,039
smithereens with an ar-10

881
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,039
we have never been ambivalent towards

882
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,720
our technologies

883
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,240
just as we have always played favorite

884
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,919
with species

885
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,480
it took her less than a minute to stop

886
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,360
shaking it felt good to butcher her i've

887
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,200
never wanted to eat neck meat so badly

888
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,600
your predator instinct is coming out he

889
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,600
says

890
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,320
perhaps but that seems way too easy

891
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,559
mostly i am amazed in how quickly a life

892
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,760
turns into just another material in my

893
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,519
hands

894
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:55,039
and what if i truly had been hungry

895
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:58,159
um so yeah that's the trailer

896
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:01,360
um there's like a longer

897
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,559
slower film but with a lot less talking

898
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,639
in it um

899
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,320
but i think with regards again to

900
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,599
thinking about the theme today

901
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:12,560
of getting [ __ ]

902
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,240
getting real um [ __ ] getting real uh i

903
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,078
just wanted to show you this piece with

904
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:20,719
the voiceover

905
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:23,919
uh yeah so i wanted to learn to hunt

906
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:26,719
um and

907
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:28,719
i didn't really know how to do it uh and

908
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,158
i had never shot a gun before so i just

909
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,839
started like hanging out actually at the

910
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:36,159
hunting store in santa fe

911
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:38,960
um talking to people um

912
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,720
telling them i want to learn to to shoot

913
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,879
guns and hunt animals

914
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,158
um and just waiting around basically for

915
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,159
somebody that i felt

916
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,240
safe enough to drive into the desert

917
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:52,480
with with a bunch of guns

918
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:55,439
um and i found a it took it took a while

919
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,119
um but eventually i did find this one

920
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:02,560
man named john

921
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:05,119
um who you know

922
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,960
this was like couple this was a year

923
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,880
before trump got elected

924
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:14,560
um yeah and he was you know i was like a

925
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:17,599
artist um from new york

926
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,320
um with all of the ideas you know kind

927
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,000
of like fully

928
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,480
embodying that stereotype i think in a

929
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,400
lot of ways never touch the gun

930
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,320
um quite kind of against guns

931
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,440
politically without really knowing too

932
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,079
much about it or

933
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,079
probably thinking too hard about it and

934
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,599
he was like a republican

935
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,440
had moved to new mexico actually

936
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,160
precisely because of the liberal gun

937
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,359
laws

938
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,359
and because he loves hunting um

939
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:48,320
and so like uh yeah very politically

940
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,079
opposed people but we ended up spending

941
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,440
you know just hours and hours and hours

942
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,520
together basically driving around

943
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,480
looking for animals to kill

944
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,320
um and you know turned off like was one

945
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,440
of the most generous

946
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,320
people i've encountered and

947
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,240
anyways without like getting into all of

948
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,960
the backstories i think like some of the

949
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,078
voice over

950
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,839
alludes to the very many contradictions

951
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:17,599
um within hunting animals including like

952
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:18,880
uh it's basically hunters that have um

953
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,119
been the strongest force for

954
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,440
conservation at least in the us

955
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,640
but i think in many countries around the

956
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,440
world

957
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,920
um yeah thinking about what we what we

958
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,000
kill

959
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,320
what we are happy killing what we are

960
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,880
less happy killing the ways in which we

961
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,240
are allowed to kill so like i said um in

962
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,880
new mexico for example you're not

963
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,200
allowed to use the car door

964
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,280
to hold up the rifle because it's

965
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,078
considered like not fair chase not fair

966
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,920
to the animal

967
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,440
you're also not allowed to cover

968
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,839
yourself uh

969
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,240
and i'm so you're not allowed to use um

970
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,680
the scent of a

971
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,279
of an animal that they want to eat to

972
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,879
kind of call the animals out but you are

973
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,119
allowed to douse yourself and raccoon

974
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,800
urine so that they can't smell you

975
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:06,000
just like all of these fine fine lines

976
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:09,119
of how we legislate ethics and nature

977
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,839
and and which technologies are allowed

978
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,040
to be used

979
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,560
um yeah that that are all only possible

980
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,560
through like through going through the

981
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,680
process but i guess the biggest thing

982
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,759
that i'll say

983
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,440
um is like i said i thought i started

984
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,280
this project thinking for sure i would

985
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,320
become a vegetarian

986
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,560
um and hate shooting guns

987
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,560
and what i learned is that shooting guns

988
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,078
especially shooting big guns

989
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:37,839
um is one of the most exhilarating

990
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:41,119
feelings i've ever experienced um

991
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:45,119
and i completely understand why

992
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,320
people um are so adamantly protective of

993
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,520
their gun rights in the us

994
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,599
and believe even much much

995
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,640
more that we really need gun control

996
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,560
because

997
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,240
it's really exciting to shoot big guns

998
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,320
um

999
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,279
but also i think like the the animal

1000
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,480
part of it

1001
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,320
um like really uh so

1002
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,240
i mentioned in the video but so i had a

1003
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,000
one month art residency but in the

1004
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,879
beginning john refused to let us go

1005
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,359
hunting for rabbits because

1006
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:17,440
um that was like wasn't real hunting we

1007
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,200
had to go look for wild domesticated

1008
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,200
pigs because we couldn't shoot like

1009
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,640
rams or elk or the usual things that are

1010
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,118
hunted because you had to apply for a

1011
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,720
permit

1012
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,560
and like actually enter a lottery a year

1013
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,759
before in order to be able to do that

1014
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,078
legally

1015
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,079
so we were like we spent a month almost

1016
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,839
looking for wild domesticated pigs and

1017
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,680
couldn't find any to kill except for

1018
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:39,520
this one dead one by the

1019
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,960
road um and by the time we started

1020
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,480
hunting rabbits it turned out to be a

1021
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,839
lot harder to kill a rabbit they're

1022
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,280
pretty fast

1023
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:48,480
um and they come out at night and you're

1024
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,240
not allowed to shoot

1025
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:55,760
between dusk and dawn

1026
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,279
um and so the the artist residency

1027
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,280
actually had to extend my artist

1028
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,079
residency for another month so that i

1029
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,000
could

1030
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,599
kill something and like finish my art

1031
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,119
project so people often say

1032
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,400
you know it's okay that you were killing

1033
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,240
because you were killing for food but

1034
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,599
really i wasn't killing for food i was

1035
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,359
killing for art

1036
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:16,640
uh which is a question all in of itself

1037
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:19,440
um but yeah in the end uh i

1038
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,960
like um shot these animals skim these

1039
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,760
animals like skinned every

1040
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,760
little bit of these animals used every

1041
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,520
little bit of these animals

1042
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,400
um and was totally also amazed at how

1043
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,560
um kind of similar i guess to the

1044
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,760
cooking of human cheese

1045
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,960
it went from being you know like when i

1046
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,440
was first cutting that

1047
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,480
face off that rabbit it was a pretty

1048
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,880
hardcore

1049
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:50,160
um but slowly it's like

1050
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,359
just another sewing project kind of like

1051
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,480
a really delicate

1052
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:57,359
craft um and the animal

1053
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,920
turns into like skin and leather and

1054
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:02,078
bones

1055
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,079
and meat and i

1056
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:08,879
became you know i had been reading

1057
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,119
tons of philosophy and history

1058
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,880
around thinking through animal rights

1059
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,400
and animals eating animals and humans

1060
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,079
eating animals and humans raising

1061
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,760
animals and humans eating

1062
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:23,280
wild animals and like in that moment

1063
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,599
doing that work i just felt okay about

1064
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,240
it

1065
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,599
um i don't know what that says exactly

1066
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,450
about me as a person but like

1067
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,599
found my place in that situation um

1068
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:34,560
[Music]

1069
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,079
okay like comfortable i stopped eating

1070
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,200
uh store-bought meat for about five

1071
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,920
years after that and

1072
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,118
never like for five years didn't eat any

1073
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,839
meat that i didn't know who

1074
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,560
killed it um because it was such an

1075
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,720
intimate

1076
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,240
process that it was like quite

1077
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,640
disgusting to me to walk into a

1078
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:54,319
supermarket and see all that packaged me

1079
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:56,480
um but those things also fade uh

1080
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:58,000
so yeah through yeah just again like

1081
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,280
through doing the work

1082
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,400
um it all gets really really

1083
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,640
complicated um both yeah

1084
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,560
like the human relationships and the

1085
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,560
human human animal relationships

1086
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,319
um yeah and then i just wanted to show

1087
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,400
i think they were earlier yeah this is

1088
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,960
just like some of the sculptural works

1089
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,400
this one is called right right right

1090
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,240
like all spelled

1091
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,160
i don't have the title here but like all

1092
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,919
the three different uh

1093
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,160
ways to spell and say right like the

1094
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,280
to rights the rights and then like the

1095
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,680
rite of passage

1096
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,560
so that's just a dear hoof that a hunter

1097
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:42,640
friend gave me and an astronaut pen

1098
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:45,920
um yeah these are some other objects

1099
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:49,279
and a photograph an image um

1100
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,640
three little pigs uh

1101
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,800
i'm just looking at the time and

1102
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,279
wondering if we want to

1103
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,240
skip the third work um because that's

1104
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,240
kind of a big one

1105
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:06,000
and

1106
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,000
you guys have any questions

1107
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:16,640
okay um

1108
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,680
okay i'll just do i'll do like a real

1109
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,400
quick overview

1110
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,879
of the one of the last things that i

1111
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,880
worked on

1112
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,520
uh

1113
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,839
yeah so

1114
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:37,040
i was asked to join the mit media lab

1115
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:39,920
um a couple years ago and

1116
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,200
kind of under the like upon being asked

1117
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,720
that you know i was asked what i want to

1118
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,480
work on before we agreed

1119
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,720
if that would happen um and i said

1120
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,319
uh yes awesome i want to be a part of

1121
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,640
the future factory which is like

1122
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,240
the have the news called the media lab i

1123
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:58,078
want to also make

1124
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:01,279
make real features um and i want to work

1125
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,960
on thinking about how humans respond to

1126
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,079
sea level rise

1127
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:09,040
um uh

1128
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,359
yeah so and i'm just gonna show kind of

1129
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,720
like

1130
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:15,200
some of the thinking and partly also

1131
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,160
like my pitch within the media lab

1132
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,960
for this work and then how the work

1133
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,000
evolved

1134
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,960
through encountering um

1135
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,960
all kinds of harsh realities uh so yeah

1136
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,480
the pitch was like this is

1137
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,520
you know a hurricane from texas from a

1138
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,440
couple years ago

1139
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,200
like uh we all know what what's

1140
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,960
happening and everybody lives in cities

1141
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,759
most of them are on the coast

1142
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,640
and like still this is the primary

1143
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,359
solution that

1144
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,799
cities have almost every city around the

1145
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,078
globe other than like a little bit in

1146
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,400
holland they're doing some

1147
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,680
experimental stuff but it's literally to

1148
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,119
build a sea wall

1149
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:55,680
so like a wall against the sea um

1150
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,240
which is not only inevitably going to

1151
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,240
break

1152
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:03,439
eventually but also just a really

1153
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,520
problematic metaphor and a metaphor

1154
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,400
that's like encapsulates precisely the

1155
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,400
way we've

1156
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,560
related to nature for hundreds of years

1157
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:15,280
that have brought us to this position

1158
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:17,759
um where nature uh is

1159
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,040
causing problems for for our way of

1160
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,880
living

1161
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:25,279
um and i have been for many

1162
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,960
years thinking about uh the ways in

1163
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,560
which humans and also non-humans are

1164
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,599
agents of our own

1165
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:35,040
evolution and so

1166
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:37,920
uh my proposal

1167
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,119
at the time when i arrived was um

1168
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,200
instead of building a wall against the

1169
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,599
sea i was interested in how humans can

1170
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,439
evolve like instead of trying to change

1171
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,880
the environment to fit our needs we

1172
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,200
change ourselves to fit a changing

1173
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,240
environment so how can humans

1174
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:55,598
adapt themselves in order to live in

1175
00:44:52,240 --> 00:45:00,078
on and under the water uh

1176
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,079
as the water rises um

1177
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,680
so when i got there i wasn't i had no

1178
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,040
idea what that would look like i thought

1179
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:11,598
it would be like all kinds of like

1180
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:15,200
implants robotics crazy mit stuff

1181
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,760
um but two things happened the first was

1182
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,240
that

1183
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,839
i really realized i was doing tons of

1184
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,879
research like thinking

1185
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,520
a lot writing a lot and talking to a lot

1186
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,280
of

1187
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:30,960
a lot of engineers and scientists

1188
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:35,119
about what's possible um

1189
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:38,000
and at first um i had

1190
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,520
the idea to to kind of come up with like

1191
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,440
a compendium of all the different

1192
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,720
possible genes of different underwater

1193
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,760
creatures that we might want to think

1194
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,000
about

1195
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,280
making use of for ourselves like whether

1196
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,800
either directly in our bodies or for

1197
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,960
technologies that we would use

1198
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,040
um kind of like a shopping catalog and

1199
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,240
then i and then i realized that that

1200
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:59,599
was again like precisely the wrong

1201
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:02,000
way to approach um

1202
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,640
other species and natural environments

1203
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
in this like

1204
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:09,200
super extractivist um

1205
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,400
consumerist way um and so in order to

1206
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,118
just like get myself

1207
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,560
out of that because our environment does

1208
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,200
affect the way we think i

1209
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,319
realized that i needed to go underwater

1210
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,720
and

1211
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:22,960
so i started i took freediving classes

1212
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,959
um

1213
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,319
while at mit that was like one of the

1214
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,160
biggest um

1215
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:33,200
things i learned how to do there um and

1216
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:36,319
in doing and doing free diving um

1217
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,640
you know the first uh lesson i went

1218
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,640
from

1219
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,000
like 15 being able to hold my breath for

1220
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,759
15 seconds

1221
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,160
to two and a half minutes right in the

1222
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:51,280
first like four hour session

1223
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:54,319
um which is kind of incredible

1224
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,599
uh and then i learned that like the

1225
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,079
the world record for the human breath

1226
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,480
hold is 11 minutes and 54 seconds um

1227
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,079
well beyond what any kind of medical

1228
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,800
doctor thought was possible

1229
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:07,440
20 years ago even um and so i just

1230
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:11,119
really um began to understand

1231
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,520
um that the capacity of the human body

1232
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,319
as it is already before we start to

1233
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,079
augment

1234
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,480
and implant and all kinds of other

1235
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,720
things is really quite well beyond

1236
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,720
what we understand right so like if with

1237
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,000
breath we are able to do so much more

1238
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,200
than we realize

1239
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,119
what about all of the other um

1240
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,720
traits that we have and how do we know

1241
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,599
like which technologies we need to add

1242
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,480
on

1243
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,839
to ourselves if we don't know uh what we

1244
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,880
can already do with what we

1245
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:41,759
already have um so that

1246
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,280
was kind of a big a big thing that

1247
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,640
happened the other thing that happened

1248
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,280
is that

1249
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,400
as i was going around the media lab and

1250
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,119
you know everybody's like oh what are

1251
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,960
you working on

1252
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,880
i was like oh i want to change people so

1253
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,440
we can figure out how to live

1254
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,599
like in and under the sea and everyone

1255
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,559
was like cool like the little mermaid

1256
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,119
um and i was kind of shocked by that

1257
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,839
response

1258
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,880
and was just like no definitely not like

1259
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,319
the little mermaid

1260
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,240
but it did get me thinking about the

1261
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:09,040
little mermaid um and i watched the

1262
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,359
movie again

1263
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,680
and i realized i don't want to be a

1264
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:16,880
little mermaid like i want to be ursula

1265
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,240
in that story um which is how i started

1266
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,319
really thinking

1267
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:26,000
about octopuses um and cephalopods

1268
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:29,680
um so the project that came out of it

1269
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,160
uh is this

1270
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,200
training transhumanism program so it's a

1271
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,040
it's a project

1272
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,520
for transhumanism but we're using

1273
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,680
training as our main technology

1274
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,280
um and we are evolving the future of the

1275
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,598
human but the

1276
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,319
model for the future of the human is um

1277
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,680
not a

1278
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:49,920
machine which depends

1279
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,720
to be kind of the predominant cultural

1280
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,800
narrative

1281
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,720
but rather a cephalopod so not just

1282
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,760
octopuses are awesome but also

1283
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:00,558
cuttlefish um squid nautilus

1284
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,240
um i have this image because like i'm of

1285
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:05,280
course also interested in

1286
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,680
um human and non-human relations

1287
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,359
and and what we so it's like kind of

1288
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,480
also a bit of a play on the idea of a

1289
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,160
model species

1290
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,520
um and what are different ways that we

1291
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,799
can learn from

1292
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:19,200
other species other than um

1293
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,400
as like very efficient uh scientific

1294
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,078
testing

1295
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:27,040
uh specimens so a bit of a play like uh

1296
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:30,000
yeah this idea of the role model species

1297
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,960
and thinking about transhumanism in a

1298
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,319
bit of a different way

1299
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:38,319
um this is just like a really

1300
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:40,800
uh good image to

1301
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:41,440
again like think about how this thinking

1302
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,280
can

1303
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,880
can shift right so like we can look at

1304
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,319
this image and we can say these people

1305
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,599
are

1306
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:52,240
using underwater metaphor

1307
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,599
to train for going to space but you can

1308
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,759
also say that they're using

1309
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,280
the metaphor and dream of space to train

1310
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,319
for being underwater

1311
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:04,800
um this image i also really love

1312
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:06,960
because um you know

1313
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,319
there is a certain dominant narrative

1314
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,480
that says like one of these

1315
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:12,480
examples is somebody more advanced than

1316
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,760
somebody less advanced but in fact

1317
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,680
they're just two really different

1318
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,680
approaches to

1319
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:21,759
being able to be underwater for a very

1320
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,759
long time right and they both have their

1321
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:31,520
benefits and drawbacks um

1322
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:35,279
so i developed a training program

1323
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:38,319
um together with dancers and engineers

1324
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,280
um and after spending tons and tons of

1325
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,960
time

1326
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,880
with different cephalopods and people

1327
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,240
that raise cephalopods and study

1328
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,400
cephalopods

1329
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,359
and so there's like a training manual

1330
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,400
with a set of

1331
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:53,598
dry exercises and wet exercises

1332
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:56,800
and there's a lexicon

1333
00:50:53,599 --> 00:51:00,079
of this world and i'll just actually

1334
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:02,880
finish perfectly on time and with a

1335
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:03,839
very short excerpt of so there's like a

1336
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,520
25 minute

1337
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:08,000
film that's kind of part invitation to

1338
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,040
join this

1339
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,040
movement and part documentation of

1340
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,319
um the process through which we

1341
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,440
developed and

1342
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:21,599
and became as cephalopod as we could

1343
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:24,160
get um so i'll let that

1344
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:25,440
take us out oh and just before before i

1345
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:29,118
do that

1346
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:32,640
um just to say that there is this

1347
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:34,400
janky tumblr website um that kind of

1348
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,200
houses all the projects like

1349
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,000
including all the different parts and

1350
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,879
then i

1351
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,880
we do workshops this is like an ongoing

1352
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,640
an ongoing thing and it in

1353
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,000
if you go to urge to breathe is a lie

1354
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,480
which is a direct quote from

1355
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,720
my freediving instructor as she's like

1356
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,280
holding my face underwater

1357
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,399
underneath the pool and my chest is

1358
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,599
convulsing

1359
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:00,400
um but it did turn out that my

1360
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,440
distribution was alive uh so if you

1361
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,800
scroll all the way down and the

1362
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,359
password's octopus

1363
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,400
you can watch the whole film but here's

1364
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:19,839
just a quick

1365
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:19,839
a quick excerpt

1366
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,630
[Music]

1367
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,839
um

1368
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:47,839
[Music]

1369
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:47,839
so

1370
00:52:55,090 --> 00:53:10,010
[Music]

1371
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:17,520
[Music]

1372
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:19,520
the cephalopod has such complicated

1373
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,759
neural structures in each of its arms

1374
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:29,839
it would be for us as if our fingertips

1375
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:29,839
have brains

1376
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:33,469
[Music]

1377
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:43,839
uh

1378
00:53:54,839 --> 00:54:00,160
um

1379
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,160
cool thanks

1380
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:15,200
share it i don't have anything else

1381
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:25,839
cool

1382
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,359
um

1383
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,799
yeah uh strange

1384
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,079
i mean people have really severe

1385
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:03,920
reactions to

1386
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:06,319
a lot of the work that i do like

1387
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:10,000
especially the first two

1388
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:12,640
projects weirdly people are

1389
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,440
much more okay with human cheese than

1390
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:17,118
this

1391
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:21,119
killing rabbits um but i leave that

1392
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:22,640
in their camp

1393
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,559
but i think as far as the approach

1394
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:28,319
itself i mean uh

1395
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:30,240
the most thing that i was told by

1396
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:33,119
someone i really respect was

1397
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,520
um like really they were thinking about

1398
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,720
the

1399
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,280
work process itself i mean like i come

1400
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,720
from

1401
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:44,240
anthropology theology and between

1402
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:47,118
search methods and think in some ways

1403
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:50,799
about my practice as a rogue

1404
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:54,480
search process um but this

1405
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:57,359
one uh that i that i

1406
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,079
respect um really thinks about like the

1407
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,759
whole process

1408
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,400
as a performance and thinking about

1409
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,559
performance as research in and of itself

1410
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,079
and then so then maybe the inverse which

1411
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:09,359
is actually really interesting

1412
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:13,280
proposition that maybe then research

1413
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:13,279
is all
