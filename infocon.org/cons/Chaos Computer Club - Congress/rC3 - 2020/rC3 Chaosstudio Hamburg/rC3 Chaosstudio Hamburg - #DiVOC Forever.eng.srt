2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,520
[Applause]

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,160
so but let's go to the next talk

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,520
the next talk is called dework forever

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,520
as you have to know

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,240
rc3 is not the first event which

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,960
happened online in the chaos orbit

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,359
as a pandemic has led to a to the

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,760
cancellation of various chaos events

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,640
a series of online gatherings has been

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,280
happening during whole 2020.

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,840
debug is also known as digitally

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,760
distributed online chaos and is quite

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,039
fundamentally different from

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,239
yet another conference moved online by

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,920
necessity so in this talk you will get a

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,760
behind-the-scene review

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,120
highlighting a variety of perspectives

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,519
now we welcome our speakers who

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,399
been as representatives for the debug

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,400
organizer

22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:07,920
organization um welcome sdb

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,040

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,799
and i have a warm

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,799
virtual applause for you

26

the stream is yours thank you very much

27
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,159
sandra

28
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,600
hello uh we are dj spock

29
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,439
benjamin stb and portal that's me

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,919
and we are going to tell you the story

31
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,399
of divock the story starts

32
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,400
when kovitz started happening for many

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,600
of us in early 2020

34
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,439
and then easter hack didn't happen and

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,039
then later on the gpn

36
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:46,320
didn't happen and mrmcd didn't happen

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,640
so instead when corvid started to happen

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,720
d-box started to emerge that's digitally

39
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,680
distributed online chaos

40
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,439
and as i just said it all started from

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,159
easter egg

42
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,320
easter egg 2020 had been well ahead in

43
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,119
its planning when it became clear

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,199
that it wouldn't be happening after all

45
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,119
but there was all this energy that had

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,000
gone into preparations and there were

47
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,639
talk submitted

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,840
and accepted and there was a team ready

49
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,440
to go

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,640
so go they did with latin

51
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,040
less than four weeks of preparation and

52
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,480
they

53
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,959
invented divock that's not a substitute

54
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,200
but as

55
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:31,599
it turned out something entirely new

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:35,440
and it included many firsts

57
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,679
it included many self-organized sessions

58
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,920
which after the event officially had

59
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,280
ended seemed to just continue

60
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,879
forever hence dework forever the event

61
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,319
had proper chaos feeling

62
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:51,359
with your very own dect

63
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,720
and overall it had the excitement of

64
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,840
something new um

65
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,159
and then moving on to may um

66
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,920
the walk happened again that was the

67
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,720
party edition this time

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,679
with a music stream more self-organized

69
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,280
sessions

70
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,440
and a notable first this time the quiet

71
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,800
cube that came to the book for the first

72
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,120
time

73
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:22,000
for september 2020

74
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,000
um next slide please

75
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,720
we moved from the home launch to push to

76
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,399
talk

77
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,599
with another set of many firsts

78
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,760
for the first time um when easter egg

79
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,798
still was drawing on the cfp

80
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,359
um well when when hidden service was

81
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,040
still drawing on the cfp for easter hack

82
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:51,440
now we had a debug with its own call for

83
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:55,040
participation and

84
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,159
rc3 was starting to be on the horizon so

85
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,679
a number of

86
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,480
teams were starting to have test runs

87
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,120
for example

88
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,280
the kids space the awareness team we had

89
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,280
a heaven we had angels

90
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,400
so as a consequence of that the

91
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,120
organization team

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,480
was larger than at previous dbox the

93
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,760
communication needs

94
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,760
changed we needed active onboarding and

95
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,880
so first to get into the details here

96
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,160
benjamin is going to be telling you

97
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,120
about

98
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,040
the organization and then we move on to

99
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,120
technical solutions

100
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:38,800
with sdb benjamin please

101
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,759
hello the management aspects that i'll

102
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,919
describe now

103
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,199
mostly represent push-to-talk because

104
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,240
that was the divorce

105
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,199
most team and somewhat the most

106
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,280
professional event

107
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,440
and actually required something like

108
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,520
management

109
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,960
we use pets for almost everything to do

110
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,120
with planning

111
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,120
even the slides of this talk run on kodi

112
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,199
md

113
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,199
obviously we had a wiki but we didn't

114
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,880
use that much for the planning

115
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,039
except for some things to do with

116
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,039
speaker communication and t-shirt sizes

117
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,720
there was a meta pad and you see example

118
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,080
of that

119
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,240
on the right side of the slides now

120
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,120
um the meta pet is the central hub

121
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,039
everything

122
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,039
like every medium relevant to it was

123
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,199
listed there

124
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,639
except for the date of the next bumble

125
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,360
um which was announced in the rocket

126
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,280
chat

127
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,000
because of my obsession with single

128
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,000
source of truth

129
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,560
one might use a wiki but ultimately pets

130
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,720
are more collaborative

131
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,000
and that made the onboarding of new

132
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,759
members easier

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,919
with the simple permission structure

134
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,440
which helped i think which i think

135
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:56,159
helped to make people feel invited

136
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,160
using pet means blower influence barrier

137
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,240
next slide please

138
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,120
here roughly you see the pads of divock

139
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,680
push to torque

140
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,860
the meter pit lists all the pads and all

141
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,160
the pads linked to the meta pad

142
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,840
[Music]

143
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,759
most of the time we had mumbles once a

144
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,159
week and in the last two weeks more

145
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,960
often

146
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,680
the marble pads existed early and more

147
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,159
about that

148
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,160
later

149
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,960
the next thing we had in the meta pad

150
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,240
was a person's list he used an imaginary

151
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,359
one

152
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,360
at divorce push to talk we had 21 people

153
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,639
when someone joined a divorce meeting

154
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,919
for the first time we asked them what do

155
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,160
you want to do

156
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,719
and wrote it into the person's list

157
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,639
regardless how insignificant

158
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,479
i think it's very important to ask what

159
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,080
do you want to do and not what are you

160
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,960
good at

161
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,080
this comes with an optimistic conception

162
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,680
of hacker where

163
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,159
when someone is interested in something

164
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,120
they can learn it it invites to

165
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,960
explore and exploration makes happy also

166
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,160
we never had to babysit anybody's

167
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,239
motivation

168
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,880
because they were already doing what

169
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,880
made them happy

170
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,800
and maybe that sounds trivial and as if

171
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,919
you are already doing it

172
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,000
but you might ask yourself when are the

173
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,799
occasions where you ask

174
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,919
what should we do and you could observe

175
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,240
observe the burden

176
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,280
that develops compared to things where

177
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,400
you started from

178
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,400
what do i want to do

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,199
i feel a bit obliged to add that

180
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,720
this type of communication built on

181
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,080
voluntariness and intrinsic motivation

182
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,080
was not always perfect from the

183
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,960
beginning we actually had two teams that

184
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,199
are more

185
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,080
used to be approached like we need you

186
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,160
appear

187
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,359
and in those cases the communication was

188
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,160
a bit slow at first

189
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,000
however i'm convinced that working based

190
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,400
on interesting motivation is a must have

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
in

192
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,960
volunteer driven events and

193
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,680
i will try to continue using that that

194
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,878
way if we

195
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,360
continue dework if it grows to more than

196
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,919
3

197
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,520
30 people though i would also make a

198
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,799
team list

199
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,719
this was a bit like we might have

200
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,720
already done a team list at push to talk

201
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,560
and then the metapad was home to random

202
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,758
things and drafts for instance

203
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,399
an early stage of call for angel

204
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,360
was lingering around as a draft for a

205
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,399
couple of weeks

206
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,159
in the meta pit this is once again an

207
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,120
invitation to work together

208
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,159
i'd argue that it is better writing on

209
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,320
one pet

210
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,720
than merging things later nobody likes

211
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,720
merging

212
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,120
and then we had the marble pads this is

213
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,800
um

214
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,200
um the mammal pads existed

215
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,479
early like they existed as soon as the

216
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,480
mumble was announced

217
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,519
and here's the imaginary pad before the

218
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,519
meeting starts

219
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,720
we always had the meeting day date of

220
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,640
mumble

221
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,320
link to metapet and list of mumble

222
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,480
attendees

223
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:19,360
and before we would collect topics

224
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,200
um who wanted to discuss something were

225
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,080
invited to write it into the agenda this

226
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,640
is good for two

227
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,839
things on first of all it supports

228
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,959
single tasking which

229
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,519
makes happy and productive and the other

230
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,920
thing does

231
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,920
is that when in the beginning of the

232
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,800
meeting there's already agreement what

233
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,439
is going to be

234
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,479
discussed the meeting is much smoother

235
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,320
in fact we

236
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,839
didn't need official moderators in some

237
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,800
sense the pets

238
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,800
were the moderators

239
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,160
as soon as the need for a pet came to

240
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,200
awareness the pet was created and linked

241
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,199
to in a meta pet

242
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,480
this was also true for feedback pads

243
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,560
and doing this in my opinion is

244
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,360
important to keep everybody's mental

245
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,920
load

246
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,079
at a bearable level by promoting signal

247
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,040
tasking especially at

248
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,040
stressful times

249
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,760
the idea for the q and a pad came up at

250
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,360
10 service where we tried to

251
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,959
get a low tech way of audience

252
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,880
participation

253
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,800
the singular angel cared for the visual

254
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,640
order in the pet and the herald

255
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,040
reads the questions directly from the

256
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,120
pad and in a very rare

257
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,040
case of bad behavior on the pad the

258
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,519
single age signal angel

259
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,360
would change the writing permission on

260
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,160
the pad to team only

261
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,000
and add questions from matrix and

262
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,600
twitter

263
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,040
um and this was somehow there was

264
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,240
chaos organizing itself magically

265
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,920
on the q and a pads people wrote um

266
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,680
answers themselves and people wrote down

267
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,279
the answers from the speaker so this was

268
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,359
something that we were surprised

269
00:10:53,279 --> 00:11:01,839
of yes and now to stp for the

270
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,839
technical details

271
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,480
you are muted sdb you have to unmute

272
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,000
well somebody muted me but apparently i

273
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,839
have to unmute myself so

274
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,040
now you should be able to hear me and

275
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,040
see me so

276
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,279
before i get into the technical details

277
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,120
let me just add one thing that was

278
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:33,839
um a rather major point for me that

279
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,360
like which which made it absolutely

280
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,920
enjoyable to be part

281
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,399
of the organizational team and that was

282
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,160
that

283
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,240
we we very quickly gathered people who

284
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,839
thought oh maybe i can contribute

285
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,360
something and they appeared for the

286
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,320
first time in one of the

287
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,440
mumbles and said uh would you mind if i

288
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,600
did this or that

289
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,240
and he said by all means go ahead that's

290
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,800
a fantastic idea just do it and

291
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,279
that that was absolutely fantastic it

292
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,079
created

293
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,720
a very nice atmosphere working together

294
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,760
and

295
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,880
i think many of the things that work

296
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,519
really well

297
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,240
got to us not by some central person

298
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,720
saying hey

299
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,880
let's do this somebody has to do this we

300
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,000
need to find somebody who can do this or

301
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,240
that for us

302
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,120
but really people popping up and saying

303
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,480
is anybody

304
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,360
doing x yet and the answer usually was

305
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,200
no nobody is

306
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,639
doing that yet but it's a fantastic idea

307
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,279
do you want to do it and they did

308
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,839
so that was really that that made it

309
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,439
super

310
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,800
cool to be part of them all right

311
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,440
into the technical details um i'm going

312
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,880
to talk

313
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,959
a little bit about the live video

314
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,279
production and how we did that

315
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,599
um how the workshops and self-organized

316
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,720
sessions work on the technical level

317
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,120
um a little bit how we uh managed uh

318
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,079
some communication and community

319
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,839
interaction

320
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,160
and finally some thoughts about free

321
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,200
software and open source

322
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,800
okay so the live video production the

323
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,560
voc

324
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,839
somehow was preparing obs studio

325
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,839
as a remote controlled video switching

326
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,360
and direction thing and they were

327
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,160
playing around with that

328
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,040
and uh when uh easter egg had to be

329
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,120
cancelled

330
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,800
uh somebody from the box said uh do you

331
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,600
wanna do a virtual event

332
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,359
and some of us said yeah why not like we

333
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,000
have all this content and if you know

334
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,000
how to

335
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,680
do like a remote thing we'll be happy to

336
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,040
work on that and that's how that got

337
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,079
started

338
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,719
and at that time obs was

339
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,880
the only thing we really had available

340
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,160
so we had a central obs

341
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,000
um that uh put together the speakers and

342
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,279
heralds and everybody else who would

343
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,360
appear on camera

344
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,320
and uh the speakers and heralds were

345
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,639
using obs

346
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,760
on their own machines to produce their

347
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,880
image and mix in the slides and all that

348
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,600
um for some things we used uh jitsi or

349
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,959
bbb

350
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,360
especially if we have multiple speakers

351
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,279
and that simply worked through kind of

352
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,800
filming the browser window

353
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:12,000
like we're doing right now the second um

354
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,920
when people are using obs to produce

355
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,279
their own video signal there's a lot of

356
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,120
latency involved so

357
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,120
typically the minimum latency that you

358
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,079
can achieve with obs is about five

359
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,000
seconds

360
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,920
and of course if you have an interaction

361
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,120
between a herald

362
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,439
or two speakers five seconds is way too

363
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,199
long that creates very awkward pauses or

364
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,959
if the latency is different between the

365
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,719
different speakers then

366
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,079
people start talking over each other and

367
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,639
that doesn't work at all

368
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:41,519
so we thought okay we have a tool that

369
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,480
enables low latency audio

370
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,760
interaction and that is mumble so all of

371
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,120
the participants were

372
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,680
together in a mumble and were talking

373
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,399
through mumble with each other and then

374
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,239
the video

375
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,519
and the audio for the stream was picked

376
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,240
up by obs

377
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,240
and we synchronized the obs so they

378
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,880
would all have the same

379
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,399
amount of latency roughly at least by

380
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,199
basically adjusting the streaming

381
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,800
parameters

382
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,880
that the obs is using and that worked

383
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,760
relatively well not perfect but it

384
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,360
definitely worked

385
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:20,160
um so of course we had the power of the

386
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,440
buck behind this event or these events

387
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,719
so the voc was providing the

388
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,839
cdn and the transcoding for that

389
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,920
and uh so that worked really well we

390
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,680
also wanted to have live translation in

391
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,599
there and that is something that this

392
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,000
year we couldn't do in the d-box that

393
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,000
simply

394
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,880
until last year i thought that computer

395
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,639
audio was a solved problem

396
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,000
and i learned this year it's not it's

397
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,920
horrible

398
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,600
basically irrespective of which

399
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,439
operating system you use

400
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,839
um and it's super hard to

401
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,360
pick up and mix together audio sources

402
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,399
in just the right way

403
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,320
to embed them into a final video streams

404
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,920
with multiple audio tracks that's that's

405
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,320
a really hard problem that

406
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,319
we don't have a good solution for but uh

407
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,519
except for with professional equipment

408
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,120
but not and on

409
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,560
basically home computers with open

410
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,000
source software but

411
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,880
work is ongoing on that um

412
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,160
but we could make the interpreters heard

413
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,320
through mumble directly

414
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,639
so we communicated simply the mumble

415
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,720
server that the interpreters

416
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,759
were speaking into while listening to

417
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,079
the live stream

418
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,800
and people could pick up the interpreted

419
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,959
audio from there

420
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,880
and the fact that we couldn't get the

421
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,560
translated audio directly into the

422
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,199
stream is also the reason most of the

423
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,758
talks from

424
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,959
the dvox are not online yet on media cc

425
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,600
cde because

426
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,959
somebody still needs to sit down and do

427
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,079
the final audio mixing

428
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:54,800
and i'm hoping to help do that in the

429
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:59,680
next couple of weeks

430
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:02,880
and yet another use of pads and kodi md

431
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,159
kodi md includes a feature where

432
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,439
you can write markdown slides and uh

433
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,760
through reveal js or javascript library

434
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,280
you can produce slides the slides you're

435
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,559
looking at right now are produced

436
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,439
exactly this way

437
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,678
and you can enable auto play and so that

438
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,959
was our info beamer so again we just

439
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,839
filmed the browser

440
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,480
window um in which this pad was running

441
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,280
and

442
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,720
that was how we got the typical info

443
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,120
beamer style

444
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,840
slides onto the stream and again

445
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,439
questions and feedbacks via the pads but

446
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,439
benjamin already mentioned that

447
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,678
one thing that is more organizational

448
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,280
than necessarily technical is

449
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,360
you need to spend a lot of time

450
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,360
preparing the speakers

451
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,280
of course at the end of this year this

452
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,719
is my has become much easier but at the

453
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,120
beginning of the year

454
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,760
virtually nobody had any idea how to

455
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,799
produce

456
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,360
good video and audio from home very few

457
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,679
people

458
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,120
had done that before maybe some gamers

459
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,559
did because they're on twitch all the

460
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,000
time i have no idea

461
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,960
but most people had no idea how bad they

462
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,799
really sounded

463
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,240
or looked on video because of the

464
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,918
lighting not necessarily

465
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,679
even because of the technological

466
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,320
limitations of their systems

467
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,720
but really because the lighting was bad

468
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,480
and

469
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,760
they were trying to use the microphone

470
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,440
that was built into

471
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,000
their laptop so getting headsets to

472
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,480
everybody

473
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,440
or or similar setups was really

474
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,520
important

475
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,600
and of course we had to rehearse all

476
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,799
this like how does this work like

477
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,320
who is going to say what when um

478
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,240
when is the speaker going to start

479
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,360
speaking and when does the

480
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,480
herald come in and all that so

481
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,799
depending on the like computer savviness

482
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,640
of uh the speakers um that could take

483
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:56,240
anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours

484
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,000
and we had a couple of complicated

485
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,679
setups where we even spent more than two

486
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,880
hours and multiple sessions

487
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,120
um to get people prepared and for the

488
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,480
most part that worked well but we had

489
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,799
especially at push to talk we had one

490
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,400
thing as our opening on a friday night

491
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,240
where multiple people from all around

492
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,240
the world were trying to join a big blue

493
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,200
button and we had no time to rehearse

494
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,440
that before

495
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,120
so the technical quality unfortunately

496
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,360
was not so great

497
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,559
which is unfortunate because it was a

498
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,439
very interesting topic

499
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,320
and maybe we find time to do something

500
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,440
like that again

501
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,439
with better quality

502
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,799
if you want to do something like this

503
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,799
yourself you don't need too many people

504
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,879
but the recommendation would be you need

505
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,000
somebody doing the actual vid

506
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:47,360
live video editing a video director

507
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
you need somebody who is the sole person

508
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,520
to contact the single point of contact

509
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
so if there is a question where's the

510
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,160
speaker

511
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
or the speaker wants to know which which

512
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,600
jitsi to join or

513
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,600
uh what other url to open um

514
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,280
you need this one person that can answer

515
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,039
all these questions maybe not answer

516
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:09,039
them themselves but knows how

517
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:11,360
who to talk to to get good answers

518
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,720
it's really useful to have a herald who

519
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,520
can moderate

520
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,080
things and is available if something

521
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,120
goes

522
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,559
wrong technically so you don't have to

523
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,639
broadcast like uh like a

524
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,760
thing like where we're going to be back

525
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,000
right right

526
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,360
real soon now or something so somebody

527
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,360
who can come on screen and quickly

528
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,840
explain what's happening right now

529
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,039
and um of course when you're using pads

530
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,320
to directly

531
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:41,440
uh let the audience uh participate in

532
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,840
asking questions at least for some

533
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,080
topics it's absolutely necessary to have

534
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,439
somebody who is monitoring these pads

535
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,840
and like make sure no vandalism happens

536
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,320
or

537
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,760
or something worse so that's really

538
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,600
useful to have that and

539
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,039
some of our heralds really enjoyed

540
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,439
having signal angels

541
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,480
who sorted and prepared the questions

542
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,960
for them so

543
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,760
sorted them by topic or indicated which

544
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,919
questions were

545
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,600
asked multiple times or something like

546
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,320
that and helped structure the pad

547
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,320
basically

548
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,799
so the heralds can simply pick out the

549
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,559
questions uh one by one without having

550
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,840
to read through a long composition on

551
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,840
irc themselves for example

552
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,840
okay on to workshops and the

553
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,400
self-organized sessions

554
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,158
as benjamin mentioned we basically

555
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,400
provided a wiki page

556
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,080
where everybody could add their session

557
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,600
and people did

558
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,480
so we had to do very little

559
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,799
to entice people to start doing that and

560
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,880
they

561
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,000
they even started improving the pad

562
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,240
sorry the wiki page

563
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,559
themselves and organize it because very

564
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,520
quickly we had a lot of entries in these

565
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,960
tables

566
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,520
and they of course

567
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,120
we could not provide the infrastructure

568
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,400
to host the session

569
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,639
ourselves but already at the time

570
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,760
we had a lot of open instances of jitsi

571
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,000
big blue button

572
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,879
uh run by reputable organizations or

573
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,120
individuals

574
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,039
so we simply provided a list of free

575
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,799
servers that people could use

576
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,879
and people picked them and then simply

577
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,240
put the link into the wiki page for

578
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,679
their event so

579
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,760
they started using that quite

580
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,880
extensively and

581
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,960
we did not have to do much except make

582
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,679
sure that the wiki page

583
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,400
was not badly formatted or something

584
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,000
like that so

585
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,760
a couple of times we had to fix a couple

586
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,159
of obvious mistakes but

587
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,679
we didn't need to edit this and although

588
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:37,039
this page was open to edit to anyone

589
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:41,120
we had no vandalism knock on wood and

590
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:43,600
so as benjamin said to our big surprise

591
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,639
um the sessions didn't end when the

592
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,600
first event ended

593
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,360
and uh we we now and then there's more

594
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,360
sessions that are announced that way

595
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,400
um so apart from the community for from

596
00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:00,159
the uh self-organized sessions

597
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,720
uh we also provided basically the wiki

598
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,679
as a central point for people to find

599
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,559
information

600
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,960
and find community resources uh like

601
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,559
which

602
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,679
uh would like uh which which uh

603
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:17,039
pads to use for the the questions uh

604
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:19,919
uh for the talks or uh where to chat

605
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,280
in in matrix or irc or discord or

606
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,559
messedon or twitter

607
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,280
like which accounts to follow and

608
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,918
again that was a community effort we did

609
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,480
not run

610
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,200
our own metric server or create anything

611
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,000
there

612
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,960
especially not discord but people did

613
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,200
and they said hey

614
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,320
i set this up can you link to it and we

615
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,039
said gladly

616
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,039
uh fantastic and there were people who

617
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,879
were monitoring those channels and

618
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,559
communicating back and forth and

619
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,679
answering questions

620
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,399
so again the community stepped up and

621
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,400
did things

622
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,799
and it became a really great event

623
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,080
without much central coordination so

624
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,279
that was again

625
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,639
a very nice thing to happen

626
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:07,279
and finally except for

627
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:10,000
the in injection of the translated audio

628
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,640
into the stream for the translators

629
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,039
everything

630
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,080
worked decently well so there's a couple

631
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,879
of tools that

632
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,760
although their open source are really

633
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,520
top-notch

634
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,879
of course there's small problems

635
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,799
everywhere um

636
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,279
but you can do this without any

637
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:28,320
proprietary proprietary tools

638
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,880
so um in this year we have heard from

639
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,200
people

640
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,159
oh no you have to use zoom everything

641
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,240
else sucks

642
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,320
and that's simply not true big blue

643
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,440
button and jitsi as video conferencing

644
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,678
systems work they

645
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,880
work very decently could they work

646
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,919
better of course

647
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,080
are they lacking features of course

648
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,600
but having had to work with some

649
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,799
commercial alternatives

650
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,320
uh in my day-to-day job i can tell you

651
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,639
that the commercial tools are not

652
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,760
necessarily any better they just suck in

653
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,400
different ways

654
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,039
um so i'm very happy to be able to do

655
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:04,400
this with free software and open source

656
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:07,120
and there's no reason to think that that

657
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,320
you couldn't do it

658
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,439
and one more thing it was very

659
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,000
interesting

660
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,279
which people came together so we started

661
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,760
using big blue button

662
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,559
and the big blue button people the

663
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,679
developers

664
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,440
became aware of it and uh contacted us

665
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,000
and said hey we're doing this

666
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,039
kind of hackathon and invited a bunch of

667
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,279
people

668
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,080
to help improve the feature set of big

669
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,000
blue button

670
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,879
and so a couple of features that have

671
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,559
been introduced in the past six months

672
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,400
are kind of the result not the direct

673
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,960
result but the the the kind of

674
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,080
interaction with the wider community and

675
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,880
some of the things we've been doing

676
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,760
and i think that's wraps it up and i'll

677
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,039
hand it over

678
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,520
to dj spock who will talk about the

679
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,000
music program in two of the three events

680
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,960
yes hi so in the first um of the three

681
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,360
events we had

682
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,760
of a divorce music program but i think

683
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,879
it was only one or two concerts

684
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,279
and when it came to um gulas pogamian

685
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,159
act

686
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:10,000
it was cancelled when i heard about it

687
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,039
then i thought um yeah

688
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,200
there must be another event uh instead

689
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,720
of that and then i tried to organize

690
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,600
another divock it was

691
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,080
way too late for um for a content like

692
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,480
talks or workshop or something like this

693
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,080
so i thought um i will make musical

694
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,559
content only

695
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,279
so we had no talks we had no workshops

696
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,320
uh we had

697
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:35,279
only music and audio art but um

698
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,760
during the preparation for this event um

699
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,799
something

700
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,320
really great happened um and there were

701
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,960
people there were just things happening

702
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,000
so people

703
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,400
were creating uh self-organized sessions

704
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,840
where creating their some kind of talks

705
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,240
some kind of workshops

706
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,199
so that was not only music on this event

707
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,720
we have also

708
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,279
a lot of other things going on um

709
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,000
we streamed non-stop from wednesday

710
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,559
afternoon

711
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,159
till a sunday evening so we had no

712
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:05,039
breaks it was a non-stop

713
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,159
live stream like 90 of the content was

714
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,799
really live

715
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,360
we have some stuff that was pre-recorded

716
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,480
but

717
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,240
most of the things were live and

718
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,760
we have done it in cooperation with

719
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,559
radio darmstadt and

720
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,080
c radar c radar is a show it's a ccc

721
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:24,399
radio show which i can really

722
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:26,720
recommend it's from chaos darmstadt

723
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,918
and uh c-radar and radio darmstadt

724
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,640
supported us with

725
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,279
their infrastructure but i will talk

726
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,320
about

727
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,600
the technical features later and and we

728
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,600
also have some

729
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,600
supporters for the content from sphere

730
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,320
radio c radio is from

731
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,799
leipzig this is an online radio also all

732
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,639
fm

733
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,639
is also an online radio it's from

734
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,000
hamburg and they

735
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,240
contributed also content to our music

736
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,279
and audio art stream

737
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,720
um and then let's talk about the

738
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,159
technology

739
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,200
um so how was it broadcasted

740
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,159
we broadcasted the audio via icecast so

741
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,799
that was no

742
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,520
videos was on the audio and we used

743
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,000
icecast

744
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,600
for the internet broadcasting the radio

745
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,360
darmstadt has of course their own

746
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,320
infrastructure for broadcasting the

747
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,320
stuff over

748
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:20,320
uh fm and also dab plus so i'm i'm not

749
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,639
sure if there already have been an um

750
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,000
ccc event that was almost completely

751
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,120
broadcasted

752
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,159
via a um

753
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,639
sorry i have

754
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,440
i have heard something i guess um so

755
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,320
that uh that was also broadcasted via fm

756
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,159
and via diab

757
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,720
plus um what technology we will

758
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,880
would we used for the organization for

759
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,960
the preparation so c file was

760
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,080
um is a really a really nice tool that

761
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,159
we really liked for exchanging data

762
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,080
for exchanging files that is also

763
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,480
non-centralized and open source tool

764
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,559
that's

765
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,000
um yeah what's why we use it we didn't

766
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,240
use any like i don't know we

767
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,200
transfer or google drive or stuff like

768
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,679
this

769
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,240
and if it comes to music we have been

770
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,760
using

771
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,640
a mix a tractor and but

772
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,399
but it doesn't mean what you think it's

773
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,600
just a shortcut for

774
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,678
broadcast using this tool and this is a

775
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,959
tool that can stream stuff to an

776
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,520
ice cast server and mix and tractor

777
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,200
are actually dj software mix by the way

778
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,600
is also an open source

779
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,640
free software for mixing and i also can

780
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,039
really recommend it

781
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,399
at the beginnings like i don't know two

782
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,039
or three years ago it was

783
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,639
really not a good software um it you

784
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,720
could actually not

785
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,159
be djing with that but right now it's

786
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,320
really really great and it

787
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,360
can directly stream to an ice cast

788
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,600
server

789
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,520
and uh tractor which actually is a

790
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,520
commercial software

791
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,120
and and it's like the state of the art

792
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,559
software if it comes to digital mixing

793
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,239
the digital djing

794
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,080
and i think it's really nice that the

795
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,399
only possibility they are have

796
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,799
in their program to stream to an audio

797
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:03,279
server is to stream to an open source

798
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,480
ice cast so um yeah that's why i'm

799
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,240
mentioning this

800
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,240
um and i also would like to mention that

801
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,960
it was a really great thing that i

802
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,600
uh started to doing this musical stuff

803
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,200
and

804
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:18,879
so much other things happened also

805
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,720
without any uh um interaction from me

806
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,559
and almost all of the people also who

807
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,919
are right now here in this talk

808
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,678
uh were supporting um this um

809
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,840
this event it was really nice and we

810
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,360
also had some music and the push to talk

811
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,480
event by actually using the same

812
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,360
technology

813
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:39,679
uh yeah and i could talk uh hours about

814
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,678
this i think that was enough overview

815
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,960
thank you very much dj spock benjamin

816
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,879
stb for this

817
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:52,240
rundown of the organizational technical

818
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,399
details and the music stream so

819
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,720
let's try to pull this all together and

820
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:59,360
look at how it worked out

821
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,840
first content i previously mentioned

822
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,320
that

823
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,199
the hidden service could rely on

824
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,320
recycled

825
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,120
submissions from easter hack but by the

826
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,840
time it came to push to talk

827
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,039
we were ready to experiment some more to

828
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,720
use the advantages

829
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:20,000
of this remote feature and we had

830
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,120
our own cfp asking specifically for

831
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
remote interactive contents and even

832
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,479
though

833
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,399
perhaps it didn't turn out perfect

834
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,720
technologically

835
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,039
it did allow us to have something like a

836
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,640
multi-site transcontinental

837
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:39,760
live transmission on on

838
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,519
broadcast on live stream that's one of

839
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,200
the examples another example

840
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:48,000
was that we had an art workshop that

841
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,279
directly was engaging the remote

842
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,760
audience and

843
00:31:49,279 --> 00:32:01,039
interacting via various social media in

844
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:03,279
in real time

845
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,120
also we've we've heard this multiple

846
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,720
times but it probably cannot be

847
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:12,320
stressed enough that debug is really

848
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:15,279
an event where everyone isn't an active

849
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,000
contributor people are not just an

850
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,120
audience it's

851
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,760
it's a real community event small events

852
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,399
but definitely very much community

853
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,279
driven

854
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,080
so in that sense divock is not for

855
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,399
tourists

856
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,240
which simply means that it attracts a

857
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,479
certain type of crowd

858
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,600
that is really eager to contribute

859
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,640
themselves

860
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,279
um so an amazing level of

861
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,080
self-organization has

862
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,399
emerged we've heard this before really a

863
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,439
lot self-organized sessions happened

864
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:47,439
and kept happening and

865
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,559
various degrees of self-organization of

866
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,360
the participants

867
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:54,240
with contributed matrix channels quite a

868
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,039
pets and so on we've referred all this

869
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,840
and it's also a format that is

870
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,279
particular

871
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,760
that turned out to be particularly

872
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:05,120
suitable for communities

873
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,679
um that are distributed to start with

874
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,678
um one of the examples is the autism

875
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,399
talk with people distributed

876
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,679
all over and another traditionally

877
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,959
distributed

878
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,919
network are the hexen please do

879
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,200
ask us more about these examples in the

880
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,559
q a

881
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,799
we have data um also

882
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,600
any double evidence here i i do want to

883
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:31,360
mention this

884
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,279
um we felt that um this kind of event

885
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,439
attracted a quite diverse and

886
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,799
international crowd and that was also a

887
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,480
very welcome

888
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:42,720
side effect so trying to summarize all

889
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,720
this

890
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,919
let me say that debugs are community

891
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,039
events that can

892
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,159
bring together people that can bring

893
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,679
together

894
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,720
communities that can spawn new and

895
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,039
improbable

896
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,279
friendships and i have to say that

897
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,720
personally this is really something that

898
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:06,480
has kept me afloat through this year

899
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,919
uh debuff can be a lot of fun to

900
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,679
organize and

901
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:14,399
attend so at this point in time

902
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,760
a very very big thank you to all of you

903
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,759
who made this happen

904
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:25,279
but also um d-box are not a substitute

905
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,239
it's just not the same as real-life

906
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,280
events

907
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:31,598
uh and we all know that um and

908
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,480
it means that when you're preparing a

909
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,679
divock

910
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,800
to happen you have to invest some energy

911
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:41,760
to manage expectations

912
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,359
people's people shouldn't be exact

913
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,839
expecting

914
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,040
the same exactly the same experience

915
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:52,000
that they would have

916
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,000
in physical events

917
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,839
also

918
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:03,359
let's not kid ourselves here

919
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,920
kovit is not done with us so we are not

920
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:08,560
done

921
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:11,599
with debug and that is

922
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,599
the well more hidden and darker meaning

923
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,079
also of divock forever

924
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,680
uh debug is here to stay for for a while

925
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,599
so let's look at the details

926
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,960
of how that can happen what can we offer

927
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:28,240
what can you offer for the future of

928
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,480
debug first of all if you're new to this

929
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,799
we invite you to catch up on previous

930
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,079
t-box

931
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,640
you will find individual events on the

932
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,920
previously mentioned wiki pages that are

933
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,560
listed here

934
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,040
and as always with chaos events you'll

935
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,599
find

936
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,279
the recorded talks of past events either

937
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,480
in the temporary life

938
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:55,040
or properly published in the archive

939
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:59,680
on media cccde with the individual links

940
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:03,279
to the talks of the events given below

941
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:05,919
secondly you can join the community

942
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,119
if you haven't already done so on the

943
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,880
one hand by

944
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,800
looking if there are still any

945
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,240
self-organized sessions going on that

946
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,839
you would like to

947
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,439
become part of you can join the

948

thirdly if you want

953
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,720
to contribute yourself if you want to

954
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,720
organize a future debug or

955
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:37,520
adopt debug elements into your own event

956
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,799
we have compiled resources on how to

957
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,119
debug

958
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,400
again in a dedicated wiki page that you

959
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,800
see listed here

960
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,079
and you're very welcome to get in touch

with us

962
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,400
with the debug team at the email address

963
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,240
listed here

964
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:57,040
so at this point before we move on the q

965
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,839
to the q a and invite you to an

966
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,040
interactive workshop right after this

967
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,680
uh stb is going to be give us a sneak

968
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,200
preview

969
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,520
for 2021.

970
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,799
that sounds like uh we have prepared

971
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,560
something already

972
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,839
um no we haven't really prepared

973
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,040
anything yet but

974
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:20,480
um as we all were preparing

975
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,440
for this current event the rc3 um

976
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,400
we all had hopes that uh the the whole

977
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,200
coronavinus

978
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,560
virus situation would would somehow

979
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,200
magically

980
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,160
be less severe than it turned out to be

981
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,640
this winter

982
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,240
and at this point it's pretty clear that

983
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,279
at least in germany

984
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:43,598
we won't have any live in-person events

985
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:46,320
at least until the summer so

986
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,440
i speak for the people who are here

987
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,800
right now but i think

988
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,280
a couple more as well we really

989
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,440
think that over easter we don't want to

990
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,760
do something again

991
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,520
whatever the name might be and i think

992
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,920
we'll just continue the tradition of

993
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,839
having a divock at easter

994
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,440
or that will be the beginning of the

995
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:08,078
tradition so to speak

996
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,359
um so if you're if you don't know what

997
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,200
you want to do over easter

998
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,400
because you're stuck at home because of

999
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,480
restrictions

1000
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,240
um think about whether you want to join

1001
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,079
debug help organize it

1002
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,759
contribute some interesting content

1003
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,320
organize a cool workshop

1004
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,359
or whatever strikes your fancy really

1005
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,920
because

1006
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,720
it continues to be also an experimental

1007
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,599
format

1008
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,598
um we're not really restricted in many

1009
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,480
ways and we can do pretty much whatever

1010
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,880
you want

1011
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,520
so if you have a cool idea that you

1012
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,079
think

1013
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,880
might be worth trying please get in

1014
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,920
touch

1015
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,480
join us and then we'll see what we can

1016
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,839
do

1017
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,839
in a couple months time

1018
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,800
so i i don't know uh that i can

1019
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,078
so the the the final thing really is the

1020
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,640
q and a we we've

1021
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,640
uh finished our time slot so there's

1022
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,200
unfortunately no time for the q a right

1023
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,759
