and i'm a cryptographic researcher

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,399
mainly uh clutter but i also led the

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,480
development

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,559
of the opera of the record messaging

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,040
protocol in session four

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,800
and on my start time i also researched

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,839
about the state of the digital rights in

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,800
latin america

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,879
and specifically i research around the

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,718
usage of digital tools to enhance

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,760
gender-based violence

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,760
in latin america specifically but today

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,280
i was wanting to talk to you about

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,160
the stage of digital rights in latin

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,159
america and this is a really big topic

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,840
uh so i will try to just cover the

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,640
basics of all of it

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,119
um so don't expect that much in in depth

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,920
of

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,040
uh of the topics that i'm going to talk

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,759
about is more of an

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,840
outline so people are more aware of the

35
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,320
state of it

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,680
so let's start with one of the most uh

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,520
interesting questions we're talking

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,560
about the state of the digital rights in

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,320
latin america

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,479
to actually talk about what is latin

41
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,479
america and for some people maybe on the

42
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,039
audience this would be really simple to

43
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,640
just

44
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,240
um because people already have a

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,360
preconceived notion of what latin

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,280
american is

47
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,280
but actually to latin americans so for

48
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,200
people living in south america or

49
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,720
central america or the caribbean or the

50
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,560
south or north america

51
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,079
this is not an easy question because

52
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,000
there's a lot of um

53
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,399
questions around when actually latin

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,079
america was created as a concept

55
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,680
and what actually means of the concept

56
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,000
to be a latin america

57
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,799
does it actually mean to have uh some

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,719
certain

59
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,920
uh cultural background that is shared

60
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,000
between each other

61
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,680
what else actually does this mean and

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,159
actually in certain parts what

63
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,360
some people will actually uh think is

64
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,119
like in america

65
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,800
some people need actually don't think

66
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,480
they belong to latin america

67
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
because sometimes they're associated to

68
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,679
be part of latin america to have to have

69
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,480
a background

70
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,560
of uh being colonized by european powers

71
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,519
and i also have an indigenous background

72
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,840
and that space

73
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,520
racism in latin america as everywhere in

74
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,840
the world certain people in latin

75
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,599
america that think themselves as white

76
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,680
don't want to belong of life to latin

77
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,238
america because of the reasons

78
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,000
so speaking of nothing america from

79
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,400
sanosia is a controversial topic

80
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,160
in itself in latin america itself but on

81
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,920
this talk i'm going to speak about and

82
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,480
be referring to the latin american

83
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,640
region

84
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,799
specifically to countries belonging to

85
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,720
the to south america

86
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,959
to central america and the caribbean and

87
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,280
to the south of north america mainly

88
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,120
to mexico and when i talk about latin

89
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,200
american as a region i'm not including

90
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,760
french guiana because that's part of the

91
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,599
la jazz de otreme is part of the

92
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,079
schengen area

93
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,599
so that's the first question that now

94
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,840
have been answered at least

95
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,359
for this talk and so actually give a

96
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,760
little bit of background why i think

97
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,599
it's

98
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,280
actually important to talk about the

99
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,319
state of digital rights and latin

100
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,200
america

101
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,879
it's uh mainly one of the reasons why i

102
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,518
wanted to give this talk at

103
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,879
ccc was mainly because sometimes in this

104
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,959
kind of conferences

105
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,640
we hear a lot about the state of digital

106
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,480
rights mainly in the global north

107
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,238
but sometimes we oblivious to actually

108
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,159
what is happening in the global south

109
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,159
and it's the same kind of a state or the

110
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,519
same kind of ideas and notions that we

111
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,519
have for digital rights

112
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,799
apply the same to the global south and

113
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,799
in this case i'm just going to be

114
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,000
focusing specifically on one region of

115
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,040
the global south

116
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,599
mainly latin america but uh they will be

117
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,599
needed

118
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,359
actually more research and more actually

119
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,480
people talking about other regions of

120
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,080
the global south

121
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,920
and to give a little bit of historical

122
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,000
context why it's actually important to

123
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,238
talk about digital rights in latin

124
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,239
america i was wanting to actually uh

125
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,760
start with this specific historic

126
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,799
instance of something that happened in

127
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,079
latin america

128
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,239
and the reason why i'm going to

129
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,400
highlight this specific instance

130
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,319
is because sometimes we think that um

131
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,640
this kind of surveillance or this kind

132
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,159
of

133
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,439
um censorship of the kind of um of the

134
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,759
kind of going against

135
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,358
uh human rights only happens sometimes

136
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,959
in the global notes because we

137
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,638
sort of associated that the

138
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,639
transgression between

139
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,120
um that the transgression between um

140
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,000
between uh towards digital rights only

141
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,240
happens between

142
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,759
spies and like big countries but that's

143
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,919
not actually the case i mean this

144
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,479
historical context i'm going to

145
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,039
show you why it also happens uh sort of

146
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,120
in latin america

147
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,880
uh so what is the theme the scene right

148
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,520
now is um

149
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,360
the cold world uh the cold war and this

150
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,639
is basically this historical

151
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,639
instance in which there were two

152
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,240
superpowers basically fighting for

153
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,520
economic political

154
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,120
and even culture i would say um around

155
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,880
the world and there are two super wells

156
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,840
with soviet union and the united states

157
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,680
of america

158
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,280
during that time during the 70s and the

159
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,080
80s latin america

160
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,198
uh sort of elected certain socialists

161
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,680
and i put socialist

162
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,600
and codes socialist governments to be

163
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,360
the representatives of the people

164
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,199
and i say socialists because sometimes

165
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,240
we have an aesthetic notion of what

166
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,000
socialism is

167
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,880
but it was in a specific notion of

168
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,560
socialism in the latin american context

169
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,280
so these governments were actually

170
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,120
elected uh but certain other powers that

171
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,000
exist also in the americas didn't

172
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,000
actually liked

173
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,759
that uh these governments were elected

174
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,199
or even they didn't like what happened

175
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,039
in cuba mainly the

176
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,280
cuban revolution so in order to prevent

177
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,479
uh for all the latin american countries

178
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,479
turning completely

179
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,080
socialists what happened is that the

180
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,240
united states factor campaign of

181
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,000
political repression and state of terror

182
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,080
involving intelligence operation and

183
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,080
assassination of opponents

184
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,000
mainly in latin america and in fact the

185
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,960
deposition of many of the socialist

186
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,720
governments

187
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,120
um that were elected in latin america

188
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,840
and this uh backed campaign of political

189
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,520
risk

190
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,520
repression happened in several countries

191
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,599
in latin america mainly in argentina

192
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,198
chile uruguay paraguay bolivia brazil

193
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,400
ecuador and peru

194
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,080
and the involvement of the united states

195
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,400
was not only about backing them

196
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,758
economically but they actually provided

197
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,840
a planning military cooperation uh

198
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,680
training on torture technical support

199
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,280
and supply military aid and this

200
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,039
happened uh during various

201
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,719
administrations of the

202
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,719
of the united states mainly during the

203
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,039
administration of johnson nixon paul

204
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,319
carter and megan

205
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,240
this not only happened between

206
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,000
cooperation between these latin american

207
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,520
countries and the united states but it's

208
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,520
also happened between

209
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,198
the same latin american countries so the

210
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,359
same countries that i just mentioned

211
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,520
also cooperated between each other to

212
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,680
provide themselves with actual good

213
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,880
planning on how to efficiently torture

214
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,120
and efficiently kill

215
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,479
political opponents uh to the regimes

216
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,720
that were installed by the

217
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,199
united states against the socialist

218
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,599
governments

219
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,280
uh during the 70s and the 80s not much

220
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,039
was known actually and how actually

221
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,359
these operations would actually carry

222
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,960
out

223
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,479
of course it was known that a lot of

224
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,000
people were here and a lot of people

225
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,880
were disappeared and a lot of people

226
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,840
were tortured

227
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,039
but it was only until december of 1992

228
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,440
that martinez

229
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,080
jose agustin fernandez drove to an

230
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,000
obscure

231
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,520
dropped to an obscure police station in

232
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,720
the suburb of la madre

233
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,719
in associal in paraguay and what

234
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,319
why they drove him to this station was

235
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,120
because with the blower actually

236
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,919
schedule

237
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,039
um the plan or where this uh police

238
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,039
station was

239
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,960
so they drove to it and what they found

240
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,280
is that they found a cache of seven

241
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,638
seven hundred thousand documents

242
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,400
pioneered to the ceiling

243
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,080
or something that later was going to be

244
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,479
called the terror archive

245
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,000
los angeles delta which was a complete

246
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,758
paper database

247
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,759
of the interrogation of records of

248
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,680
integration torture and surveillance

249
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,080
that was conducted under the military

250
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,039
dictatorship of alfredo strossner which

251
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,639
was the paragon

252
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:06,000
a paraguayan dictatorship during the

253
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,919
military intervention of latin america

254
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,800
what they found out is that mainly it

255
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,039
was used uh informants telephoto cameras

256
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,199
watch apps to build this paper database

257
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,120
of everyone that was viewed as a threat

258
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,720
and i highlight here that was everyone

259
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,639
that was viewed as address

260
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,919
was not actually only people who were

261
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,919
actually deemed to be

262
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,000
actual political opponents to the

263
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,919
military regimes during those times

264
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,120
but it was mainly everyone that they

265
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,359
thought was actually

266
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,479
uh some kind of threat it could have

267
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,640
been an artist

268
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,479
uh creating art that was against the

269
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,559
regime it could have been

270
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,880
students that for some reason decided to

271
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,799
read karl marx so all of these people

272
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,480
that somehow were associated with

273
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,560
socialism or somehow were

274
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,760
deemed to be opponents of the regime in

275
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,959
that time were

276
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,720
um targeted as threats and it was not

277
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,000
only them but also the friends and their

278
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,920
associated so

279
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,040
they created a database on not only the

280
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,040
people that they think

281
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,599
they were a threat to the military

282
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,880
regime but also of any kind of friend or

283
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,200
any kind of family that they have

284
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,519
the archive was a total of 60 000

285
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,040
documents and where the photos and comp

286
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,000
and it compromised uh 593 000 microphone

287
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,160
pages

288
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,120
the restored level of this and of all of

289
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,800
the database

290
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,959
and all of all of this torturing a lot

291
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,000
of these killings was that up to 50 000

292
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,719
people were killed

293
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,160
30 000 disappeared and 400 000 were

294
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,160
arrested and in prison

295
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,000
and until this day if you go to any of

296
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,600
the countries that i have just mentioned

297
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,279
you will see several instances and

298
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,560
several families of action

299
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,640
of people um or relatives of people who

300
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,680
actually disappear and until these days

301
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,839
there's a lot of

302
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,680
countries in which a lot of people still

303
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,519
ask for the bodies of the people who

304
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,719
disappear or at least to know what

305
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,080
happened to the people

306
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,920
to disappear

307
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,760
so why i'm speaking about this the

308
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,199
reason why i'm speaking about this is

309
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,600
because we sometimes think that these

310
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,279
things

311
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,360
don't happen at this level that people

312
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,399
don't get disappeared because there is a

313
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,440
paper database

314
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,240
of you that uh that showcase yourself as

315
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,320
a threat

316
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,279
for some reason for whatever reason just

317
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,160
because you

318
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,920
somehow read some book that uh someone

319
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,040
deemed that it should be unacceptable to

320
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,800
be read during that

321
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,319
time which was what happened in latin

322
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,079
america about that time

323
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,680
and the other reason why i'm showcasing

324
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,519
this is because sometimes we think that

325
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,439
countries only surveil their own

326
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,519
citizens well this is not true it was

327
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,120
even true in the 70s and the 80s

328
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,200
that several different countries that

329
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,360
had military governments at that time

330
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,880
were surveilling the citizens of other

331
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,880
countries and these countries were

332
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,439
sharing these databases between each

333
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,560
other

334
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,399
and the other reason why i'm

335
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,760
highlighting this is because this was

336
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,920
not like a

337
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,519
stall or solitary operation that was

338
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,040
happening because these latin american

339
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,880
countries decided to do it

340
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,319
this was backed out and actually planned

341
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,000
by the united states

342
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,839
this well known and the victims of the

343
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,399
torture have actually stated several

344
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,000
times

345
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,079
that for example that they when they

346
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,120
were being tortured uh there was always

347
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,880
the presence of a

348
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,880
united states person in the room

349
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,000
actually training people on how to

350
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,000
efficiently turtle

351
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,680
training people onto how to efficiently

352
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,480
track people training people on how to

353
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,719
efficiently

354
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,800
create this database what will happen

355
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,040
today today will be that this

356
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,719
kind of paper databases that existed on

357
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,480
that time will be much more efficient

358
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,200
because people are using the digital

359
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,120
dose

360
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,560
every day and it will be the same that

361
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,560
they will be backed by

362
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,359
some um power some more powerful country

363
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,000
that will have an

364
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,720
interest in the economic and political

365
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,040
um

366
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,760
scenario of several different countries

367
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,000
so today

368
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,360
this much they will be much worse but

369
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,720
the reason why i wanted to highlight

370
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,079
this is to actually show you a

371
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,000
historical instance

372
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,199
when indeed this happened and that it

373
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,320
could indeed happen

374
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,920
in the future as well so what's the

375
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,760
theme when talking about the digital

376
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,599
rights of latin in latin american

377
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,079
countries in this talk i decided to talk

378
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,920
about

379
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,519
four main topics that i think are really

380
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,719
important with talking about digital

381
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,880
rights in a region

382
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,399
the first one is to talk about what kind

383
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,320
of privacy laws exist

384
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,240
on those countries the second one is

385
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,880
talking about the types of cohesion that

386
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,200
exist

387
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,519
in these countries by the using or by

388
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,279
the usage of digital tools

389
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,200
the third one is to talk about the state

390
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,959
of civilians of those countries and the

391
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,639
fourth one is to actually talk what kind

392
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,399
of secure communication are actually

393
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,160
provided in those countries

394
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,320
so let's start with the first one which

395
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,920
is actually the privacy laws

396
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,760
and on this um since the arrival of gdpr

397
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,560
has been like a hot topic for

398
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,600
now some years but indeed this is not

399
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,920
something that just

400
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,600
was just created by the arrival of gdpr

401
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,160
but indeed for example in the human

402
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,680
rights

403
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,519
it's actually defined privacy is

404
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,199
actually defined as a human right

405
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,800
and because of this most of latin

406
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,880
american constitutions

407
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,839
actually provide some certain kind of

408
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,680
protection

409
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,560
towards previously because it's part of

410
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,560
the human strides

411
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,320
mostly in the past the constitution have

412
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,880
was only focusing on

413
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,720
privacy as part of the non-digital world

414
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,639
but as with the arrival of the digital

415
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,000
world privacy is also applied to the

416
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,680
digital world

417
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,600
since 2010 worldwide 62 new countries

418
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,959
have enacted data protection laws and

419
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,200
every countries as

420
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,518
i have said in latin america has some

421
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,279
form of private uh data protection

422
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,720
in latin america the first country to

423
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,720
actually have a privacy law

424
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:21,279
um was chile in 1999

425
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,920
followed by uruguay mexico peru colombia

426
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,240
brazil

427
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,199
although in brazil would put an asterisk

428
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,000
asterisk

429
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,880
because even though it was created in

430
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,800
2018

431
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,360
some parts of the law still needs to be

432
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,680
debated on august 2021

433
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,519
and some parts of the law were actually

434
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,359
video by the current president

435
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,680
and there has been some pushback around

436
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,040
that law for a while now

437
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,000
other countries that have actually a

438
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,519
privacy law at barbados and panama

439
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,880
one of the questions that you can ask

440
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,800
yourself when actually talking about

441
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,800
privacy laws in that in america

442
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,560
if this is actually a phenomenon in

443
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,560
itself or it's just like something that

444
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,680
has been inspired because of the arrival

445
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,680
of gdpr

446
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,519
in most of the cases uh that we have

447
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,880
actually seen it's actually mostly

448
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,800
inspired by gdpr

449
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,399
because it's mostly what is right now in

450
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,399
fashion so to say

451
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,480
um but it actually needs to actually

452
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,240
happen still a lot of research to

453
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,079
actually say that this is a phenomenal

454
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,920
of their own or that these privacy laws

455
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,120
are actually thinking of the reality of

456
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,040
latin america

457
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,399
on their own and not just taking some

458
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,839
other privacy laws from other countries

459
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,519
so the first question that actually

460
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,480
needs to be addressed when talking about

461
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,800
privacy laws

462
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,519
in the latin american concept context

463
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,279
itself

464
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,120
is to talk about what is privacy in

465
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,199
itself and this is something that now

466
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,800
scholars and researchers are actually

467
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,120
talking much more

468
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,560
around in the sense that even though for

469
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,480
one region privacy

470
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,399
uh will mean something because of the

471
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,240
cultural background of this region

472
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,680
for another reason maybe privacy will

473
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,040
not be deserved

474
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,120
the same because of the different

475
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,480
culture meaning of privacy depending on

476
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,079
the region of the world that you're

477
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,680
talking about

478
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,519
so for example something that still

479
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,000
needs to be researched is what actually

480
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,560
means

481
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,880
uh what me what privacy actually means

482
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,479
for a latin american context what does

483
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,079
latin americans actually think of

484
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,639
privacy itself

485
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,079
the other thing that actually um gets a

486
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,040
lot of talking when you're talking about

487
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,120
privacy laws

488
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,639
is what actually applies to privacy

489
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,760
privacy it's only the contents of

490
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,399
communication

491
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,120
that gets the status of the status of

492
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,199
being private

493
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,199
or if anything for example the network

494
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,880
transmissions are actually also part

495
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,399
of privacy and this is something that

496
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,120
still um

497
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,720
been talked around the same winter when

498
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,360
talking about privacy laws in latin

499
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,519
america

500
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,680
actually thinking about what what data

501
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,839
is defined as private as i have said

502
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,959
and what about metadata or subscriber

503
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,680
data and what about

504
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,560
linked data metadata is usually what

505
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,319
they say is

506
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,399
uh they usually define it as like

507
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,279
auxiliary data that gets created during

508
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,519
for example

509
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,959
having a conversation subscriber data

510
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,560
sometimes they define it as the

511
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,279
auxiliary data that the

512
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,199
initiator actually created and linked

513
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,959
data is more about this data that can

514
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,120
actually be linked to an individual and

515
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,439
use for example for advertisement

516
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,440
several of the different laws in several

517
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,920
latin american countries have different

518
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,800
uh approach to all of this these

519
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,599
definitions

520
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,920
but most of them are mainly inspired by

521
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,000
the same gdpr definitions

522
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,000
what about anonymous data certain of the

523
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
privacy laws indeed have

524
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,160
in latin america indeed have some kind

525
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
of mention of anonymous data i think in

526
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,759
the brazilian one for example

527
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,360
they say that anonymous data should be

528
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,079
prior should be private

529
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,800
if by some reason for example you are

530
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,839
able to d

531
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,758
and the anonymize the data by using the

532
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,360
same mechanism that the service that

533
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,759
anonymize the data

534
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,680
are used you manage to de-anonymize it

535
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,320
and then the data is also considered

536
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,000
private

537
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,519
but if like for example you took the

538
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
data um

539
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,639
created by some service and you later by

540
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,639
using

541
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,920
a completely different mechanism that

542
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,480
the one provided by the

543
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,399
service you manage to de-anonymize it

544
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,440
then that that data is not private

545
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,360
anymore

546
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,360
and this is sort of mentioned a little

547
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,640
bit like in a big terms but

548
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,079
at least it's there um so i just wanted

549
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,360
to highlight these questions in the

550
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,799
sense to actually say

551
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,799
the most of the time when you read the

552
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,839
privacy uh laws of different latin

553
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,599
american countries

554
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,359
the sort of notions are sort of vaguely

555
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,520
defined or sort of vaguely

556
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,599
mentioned but not that much going in

557
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,359
depth of the different notions

558
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,359
one important thing to actually think

559
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,760
about when talking about latin american

560
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,918
privacy laws is what about the data that

561
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,760
that gets sent or transmitted to other

562
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,240
countries because one of the

563
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,400
realities of latin america is that there

564
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,200
are some services that provide

565
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,400
us that provide certain kind of services

566
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,880
in latin america that

567
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,600
are latin american itself meaning that

568
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,080
they are like

569
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,199
uh companies that were created in latin

570
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,360
american countries

571
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,360
and where the data is stored in the same

572
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,159
country but most of the time in latin

573
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,879
america

574
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,960
the consumers of applications mainly use

575
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,760
social media that is created in other

576
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,520
countries

577
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,440
and where the data goes to another

578
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,679
country or

579
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,840
communication systems that go to another

580
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,280
country most of the privacy laws in

581
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,199
latin america

582
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,480
latin america actually says that

583
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,400
actually says

584
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,240
that if the data gets transmitted to

585
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,480
another country

586
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,919
that these other country should have the

587
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,640
same level of protection

588
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,960
as the one that is uh given in the in

589
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,919
the

590
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,840
owner's country but even though this is

591
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,760
set in most of the privacy laws in

592
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,199
practice this actually does not happen

593
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,679
until this day i have not actually seen

594
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,919
anyone actually asking any of the

595
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,200
companies that we use for social media

596
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,120
or for communication

597
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,559
to actually surrender the data to say

598
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,559
that they are not applying the same

599
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,039
level of protection that latin american

600
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,120
laws

601
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,080
provide for their own data so that is

602
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,799
still

603
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,399
it gets on the law but in practice not

604
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,240
much happening

605
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,840
and another question that you should ask

606
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,600
yourself when talking about privacy laws

607
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,159
is what about the data that is already

608
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,000
stored

609
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,280
so one of the things is that even though

610
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,840
this that

611
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,000
these privacy laws exist even though

612
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,879
they existed for some long time

613
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,480
um still certain uh countries and

614
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,000
certain companies in other countries

615
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,120
have been installing this data for a

616
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,440
really long time

617
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,199
and we don't know if there will be at

618
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,080
any point any kind of request to

619
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,080
actually say

620
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,360
yes to render the data of all our

621
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,439
citizens that you have

622
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,879
a store for this amount of time that

623
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,160
doesn't have happened

624
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,440
so far now let's talk about the second

625
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,520
topic that i was uh

626
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,440
outlining in the other introduction the

627
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,679
second talking topic is the times of

628
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,440
cohesion what kind of cohesion actually

629
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,760
exists in south america

630
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,520
in latin america in regards to digital

631
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,720
rest and in regards specifically to

632
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,480
freedom of expression

633
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,799
of the current state of what happened in

634
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,679
kovite 19 and about gender-based

635
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,039
violence

636
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,640
by using uh digital tools so the thing

637
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,840
first thing about the health system and

638
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,799
kobe 19

639
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,559
so in this um this is a really complex

640
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,000
topic but i will just try to highlight

641
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,799
certain points

642
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,720
uh about instances in which uh digital

643
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,960
tools are being used to actually

644
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,919
diminish the rights that people have to

645
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,679
other things

646
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,440
specifically something digital tours

647
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,760
have been used to diminish the right

648
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,360
people to help to the health system and

649
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,280
to the education system

650
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,439
so in one instance of this happening for

651
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,080
example is by the usage of biometrics

652
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,480
which is the

653
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,960
on arise in latin america specifically

654
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,200
in chile and in brazil

655
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,240
one of the proposals for example for

656
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,480
chile was

657
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,480
to use biometrics uh during health

658
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,159
checks meaning that you will have access

659
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,000
to certain public systems

660
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,520
and some and to certain um to certain to

661
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,200
certain health checks only by

662
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,240
surrounding the surrendering

663
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,880
the the biometrics of yourself

664
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,080
and this actually doesn't apply to the

665
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,880
latin american

666
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,158
um region in the sense that for example

667
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,840
in the rural areas

668
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,360
most of the people that were asked to

669
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,120
surrender the fingerprints

670
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,479
because the work they feel or because

671
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,439
they sometimes have some kind of

672
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,280
disabilities

673
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,960
the fingerprints could not be read

674
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,399
because there was no fingerprint or

675
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,760
because the fingerprint was really

676
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,360
difficult to be read

677
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,280
what this mean is that the health system

678
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,918
became unfair in itself

679
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,918
because the people who were not able to

680
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,360
access a health system anymore because

681
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,840
they could not really surrender the

682
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,479
biometrics because the idea of biometric

683
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,439
didn't match their current reality and

684
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,120
this is

685
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,440
something that we will talk during this

686
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,039
talk quite a lot but sometimes in latin

687
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,120
american governments they take one

688
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,879
technology because they think it's cool

689
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,439
or is what other countries right now are

690
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,200
using

691
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,280
but they don't thinking of what it means

692
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,320
to actually apply this technology

693
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,280
in a latin american reality another

694
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,840
instance in which

695
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,678
biometrics are actually abused in latin

696
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,520
america and this is an abuse that is

697
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,880
happening not because of latin american

698
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,120
governments or maybe it is

699
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,240
in a way but mainly because when latin

700
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,239
americans have to

701
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,919
travel to another country for tourism or

702
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,400
for working or for whatever

703
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,240
reasons they usually have to apply for a

704
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,280
visas for the schengen area or for the

705
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,880
united states

706
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,879
and most of the times they are asked to

707
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,080
surrender the biometrics at the time of

708
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,200
applying for the visa

709
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,639
or sometimes at the time of of uh of

710
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,799
crossing the border

711
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,720
it's not really known what happens uh

712
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,760
with the biometrics of the people who

713
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,679
are are being asked to surrender them

714
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,879
for the visas or the legality of

715
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,600
actually of all of these um it's not

716
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,840
known where

717
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,840
is this distort and in some instances

718
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,199
even uh when you are surrendering your

719
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,840
application for your visas and

720
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,840
surrendering

721
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,240
your biometrics you're also asked to

722
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,720
sort of surrender your social media um

723
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,880
in the sense that most of the times uh

724
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,559
in order to be guaranteed to be given a

725
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,240
visa you have to sort of know

726
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,600
that your social media is going to be

727
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,880
examined uh

728
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,480
and it's going to be checked that you

729
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,000
don't have anything that that country

730
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,840
that you're willing to travel to

731
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,799
deems um bad but coming back to this

732
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,039
health system

733
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,639
uh sometimes in the health system for

734
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,240
example uh

735
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,799
the reason why for example latin

736
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,480
american uses social media quite a lot

737
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,000
is because sometimes the social media is

738
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,880
the only option do they have

739
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,240
and this you will see in a few slides uh

740
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,880
that i will talk about this in the

741
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,840
future

742
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,400
but sometimes because uh latin america

743
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,399
has an

744
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,919
unfairness between what kind of

745
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,120
discourse gets pushed

746
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,200
in the in the mass media what happens is

747
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,760
that minorities usually go to social

748
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,159
media

749
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,840
to actually try to put themselves in the

750
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,840
discourse or to actually

751
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,959
have support from other people or to

752
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,439
showcase what kind of

753
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,159
fairness is happening to them which is

754
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,159
um

755
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,919
which is bad in itself because this is

756
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,600
the only way that they can publish what

757
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,799
is happening to themselves

758
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,639
and at the same time they are

759
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,639
surrendering surrendering their

760
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,320
information to social media companies

761
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,919
that exist in other countries

762
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,678
so in the case of the health system for

763
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,919
example this happens quite a lot

764
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,880
uh with people who are who are hiv

765
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,480
positives

766
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,840
in the sense that because they don't

767
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,200
have a support from the local

768
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,240
governments from the local latin

769
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,240
american governments

770
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,240
they use social media to actually find

771
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,360
psychological support or to find any

772
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,080
kind of support

773
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,840
or or even to actually find any way to

774
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,639
buy the medicine that they need because

775
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,559
the woman

776
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,320
government is not providing the

777
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,559
medicines that they need what they do is

778
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,120
that they have created their own market

779
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,720
in which they can uh buy the medicines

780
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,279
that they need because the wellbeing

781
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,720
government is not providing this what in

782
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,000
reality this

783
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,799
makes is that there's some there is

784
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,360
an unregulated market for medicines and

785
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,200
there's

786
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,199
extortion and of course there's data

787
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,640
that is being stored in the social media

788
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,640
of these companies that exist

789
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,960
outside of latin america about the

790
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,000
health status of the people

791
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,679
are suffering from from this the thing

792
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,320
happened during coveted nightside

793
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,240
in which mainly all of the health system

794
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,200
of all latin american countries

795
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,720
collapsed

796
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,240
and what happened is that there was a

797
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,720
lack of medicines and

798
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,080
people started selling uh medicine again

799
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,760
through social media

800
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,279
um or oxygen tanks or other kind of ways

801
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,039
that's the only way that people could

802
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,679
actually sometimes get medicines through

803
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,919
the use of

804
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,440
usage of social media and this again

805
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,080
poses the question that this was the

806
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,760
only way

807
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,918
that people could actually access the

808
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,000
health system and at the same time they

809
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,440
were giving away the private information

810
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,840
and the health information

811
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,200
to companies that exist outside of the

812
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,360
latin american countries

813
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,039
because it was the only way in which

814
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,399
they could access some kind of

815
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,039
health checks just to give you an

816
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,400
example

817
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:24,000
in uh on a specific example and a study

818
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,039
in 2019

819
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,760
showcase that in ecuador uh 10.7 percent

820
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:32,480
of people between the ages of 15 and 49

821
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,480
as defined as digital illiterates and

822
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,720
only

823
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,120
41.4 has access to a smartphone

824
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,120
and there's more access to smartphones

825
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,760
and in general to the internet in urban

826
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,520
areas

827
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,879
and there's more access to smartphones

828
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,360
from men than from women

829
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,200
and other genders this is really

830
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,360
important to highlight especially when

831
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,520
talking about kovite 19 because one of

832
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,799
the proposals that the latin american

833
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,440
governments have had

834
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,000
is that in order to know how much people

835
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,640
have

836
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
been infected with kobe uh you should

837
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,960
install an application

838
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,720
on your phone that actually tracks uh

839
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,880
your movements and this of course has

840
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,000
privacy implications for your

841
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,679
um the data around your location but it

842
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,960
also doesn't really make sense in a

843
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,480
latin american

844
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,400
scenario because most of the people

845
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,480
don't actually have a smartphone

846
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,640
so actually asking people to install an

847
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,080
application for kovind 19 when they

848
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,640
don't have a smartphone

849
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,000
or asking people to start an application

850
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,799
uh to for example

851
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,279
schedule health checks um doesn't make

852
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:36,960
sense in that in america and just

853
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,559
makes it why the the the unfairness of

854
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,640
the health system itself

855
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,440
and this is again an example of the

856
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,039
onset of the ideas that sometimes local

857
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,360
latin american governments have that

858
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,000
they just see that other countries are

859
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,000
actually

860
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,760
um creating an application for tracking

861
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,600
the kovid 19

862
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,600
but it doesn't really make sense into a

863
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,678
latin american reality and

864
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,918
so yeah and another topic sort of

865
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,159
related to creation and unfairness

866
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,520
is gender-based violence so when a study

867
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,440
of the world health organization in 2002

868
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,200
showcased that gender-based violence is

869
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,679
the main cause of death of women in the

870
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,400
world

871
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,080
and the 23 of women or women worldwide

872
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,840
have reported some kind of digital

873
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,678
gender balance

874
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,600
for an example in the latin america

875
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,559
conflicts itself in ecuador

876
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,879
every 71 hours some woman is killed and

877
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,879
if

878
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,720
this women don't get killed in a quarter

879
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,720
it's not because someone for example was

880
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,240
trying to steal something from them

881
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,000
but they were killed because they were

882
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,600
women so this is often

883
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,760
a times called a femicide latin american

884
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,120
countries are

885
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,440
pretty much sexist um so

886
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,279
as i said most of the minorities in

887
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,440
latin america don't have a way to

888
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,240
express their struggles or to gather

889
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,240
support

890
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,080
through mass media or through the or

891
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,600
through the discourse or to the

892
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,600
main discourse that happens in the

893
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,039
countries so what they do is that they

894
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,600
switch to social media

895
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,240
or any other kind of digital to sort of

896
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,320
empower

897
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,679
the struggle that they are living but

898
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,000
what happens is that

899
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,080
um because they have been using social

900
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,799
media or they have been using digital

901
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,960
tools

902
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,918
some other groups have actually targeted

903
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,679
them uh

904
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,240
through the internet and actually

905
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,600
surveilled their usage of social media

906
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,720
they have

907
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,360
they have created um strategies for hate

908
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,520
speech

909
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,678
unauthorized discrimination of intimate

910
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,120
images cyber sexual harassment

911
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,720
trafficking inspiration of their

912
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,199
identity and censorship

913
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,360
so if you talk to any person or activist

914
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,520
who's actually working on gender-based

915
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:42,000
um activism or in lgbtai

916
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,200
plus activism you will see that they are

917
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,360
always targeted

918
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,559
uh by the usage of social media and

919
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,399
there's actually uh

920
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,720
on some instance that i talked to some

921
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,120
activists there was actually a showcase

922
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,159
that

923
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,799
um right-wing uh parties and right-wing

924
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,440
people

925
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,600
actually create trainings on how to uh

926
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,320
how to actually harass

927
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,918
activists uh by using social media one

928
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,080
important case to highlight here

929
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,080
and it's again from ecuador is the case

930
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,279
of juliana campo verde which is a woman

931
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,559
that was killed

932
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:14,559
by an uh christian pastor

933
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,000
and what this christian pastor did was

934
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,559
that he hacked

935
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
into the social media of this woman to

936
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,720
actually try to convince

937
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,200
the family that she was not disappeared

938
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
um

939
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,559
and this was actually at the beginning

940
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,200
not even taking into account by the

941
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,799
court but

942
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,960
later by um but actually

943
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,279
by pressuring it it was actually taken

944
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,600
into account

945
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,080
as i stated mainly uh the people the

946
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:43,439
minorities who actually try to uh

947
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:46,080
be actively um actively

948
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,559
fight for the rights of women or lgbta

949
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,199
plus

950
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,279
a i latin america get a lot of hate

951
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,960
speech they always get the fresh sharing

952
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,600
of their photography

953
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,000
monetary commenting reporting every post

954
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,879
they send them masturbation videos of

955
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,960
men

956
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,919
uh and what also happens and in one

957
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,559
instance that i was

958
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,480
um helping one woman for example all of

959
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,520
their photographies were taken from the

960
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,919
social media

961
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,720
and it's a specific men created art

962
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,080
based on them

963
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,960
and that was a sexual uh of sexual

964
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,120
nature of these uh photographies that uh

965
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,120
this person took uh from her

966
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,120
account and that happens all the time

967
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,158
and most of the time when

968
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,080
women or other groups actually try to

969
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,840
publicly say that this is what is

970
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,520
happening to them or they go into the

971
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,520
judicial system to say that this is

972
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,240
happening to them and that is unfair and

973
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,320
illegal

974
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,600
most of the time they are diminished

975
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,120
because they say that this

976
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,840
is just hysteria of women in the cases

977
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,399
of grooming

978
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,559
um this specifically happens in latin

979
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,559
america for teenagers and for children

980
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,399
and what this research has shown is that

981
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,678
this happens through the usage of social

982
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,320
media for teenagers

983
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,159
and the usage of games are for children

984
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,559
one important thing to note here is that

985
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,559
in most

986
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,000
global north countries uh it has been

987
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,120
said that one of the reasons why we

988
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,440
should break end-to-end

989
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,039
encryption of certain secure messaging

990
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,679
application is because they're trying to

991
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,399
find

992
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,840
child predators they have uh or child

993
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,678
sexual harassments

994
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,279
uh that operate at a level that

995
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,799
sometimes is international

996
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,200
and while it's true that sometimes they

997
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,918
find the sexual predators

998
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,399
um what happens is that this person gets

999
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,200
locked

1000
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,320
or something similar but not really a

1001
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,559
reparation for the

1002
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,439
people who were harassed in global south

1003
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,360
countries

1004
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,480
so yeah and as i said um there's massive

1005
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,959
attacks against uh people uh fighting

1006
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,600
for

1007
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,279
rights specific to gender uh in one

1008
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,519
instance for example we know that they

1009
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,799
were even giving like training sessions

1010
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,840
for how to censor

1011
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,720
uh people activists that were working in

1012
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,600
gender

1013
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,600
based uh rights for example there was

1014
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,840
one instance in which they were

1015
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,000
given seminars on how to efficiently

1016
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:00,080
target and how to efficiently

1017
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,399
um send like memes and create sexual

1018
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,519
imagery of this person so they will

1019
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:08,320
silence themselves in their activist

1020
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,519
plans so the goal is always the silence

1021
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,439
and intimidation

1022
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,799
in the specific context of domestic

1023
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,720
gender-based violence

1024
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,480
it doesn't happen as it is often

1025
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,799
highlighted in a global note that it

1026
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,480
happens often by installing for example

1027
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,840
more way in the cell phones or in the

1028
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,840
devices of the victims

1029
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,000
that doesn't happen a lot what happens

1030
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,399
most of the times is that the past would

1031
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,440
get the stolens by either by cohesion or

1032
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,559
either because

1033
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,360
the person sort of guessed um

1034
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:37,519
or what also happens is that most of the

1035
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,120
time in domestic abuse cases what

1036
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,200
happens is that the perpetrator

1037
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,158
perpetrator will take away the devices

1038
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,159
of the victim

1039
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,159
they will take up away their computer or

1040
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,799
their smartphones or whatever they have

1041
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,840
um instead of to isolate the big thing

1042
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,240
so it's not

1043
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,120
much more about installing malware as it

1044
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,799
is in global north countries

1045
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,320
but in this case there's a lot that is

1046
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,279
actually missing and there's a lot of

1047
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,120
research that is

1048
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,399
needed around the topic there's a lot of

1049
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,799
research to actually call

1050
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,320
these acidities this is actually

1051
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,080
targeted surveillance uh

1052
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,678
even though some people have actually

1053
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,360
not called it that way

1054
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,440
because they say that this is just uh

1055
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,199
this is just activists being targeted

1056
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,120
or this is just activists that are

1057
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,960
complaining too much or this is you know

1058
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,518
the state of the world in which

1059
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,159
um obviously if you're a feminist you

1060
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,000
will get all of this targeted

1061
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,200
targeted harassment but that's not true

1062
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,880
this is actually

1063
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,480
what the research has actually shown in

1064
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,559
latin america is that this is

1065
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,000
actually targeted harassment around

1066
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,918
groups so there are seminars who

1067
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,559
actually train to how to efficiently do

1068
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,960
this

1069
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,080
there are facebook groups and private

1070
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,200
what what's a group

1071
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,600
with in which the social media of uh

1072
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,840
of activists they share and people are

1073
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,559
encouraged to sexually harass or harass

1074
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,399
in any way these people

1075
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,000
um it's something that is missing that

1076
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,600
is an interesting research to actually

1077
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,240
do is to actually find out how the

1078
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,959
campaign

1079
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,480
of the the homosexualization clinics

1080
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,080
happening in latin america

1081
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,840
they are usually happening in over

1082
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,720
social media what uh what is the

1083
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,719
homosexualization clinics is basically

1084
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,720
some clinics that exist in latin america

1085
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,839
that they say there are clinics for

1086
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,520
uh drug uh drug related issues so you do

1087
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,119
recover your drug addiction but in

1088
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,440
reality what they are is that there are

1089
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,200
clinics in which

1090
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,000
lgbtia plus uh people are actually

1091
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,638
kidnapped

1092
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,520
and tortured until they become straight

1093
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,200
what actually

1094
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,440
means we commenstrate i don't know but

1095
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,199
they are actually torture in many cases

1096
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,399
they are raped and this happens all over

1097
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,598
latin america

1098
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:38,078
and the way that uh these uh clinics are

1099
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,760
showcased or advertised is to the usage

1100
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,879
of social media so it will be really

1101
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,879
interesting to show

1102
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,719
to have a research around how what

1103
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,199
actually are the strategies that these

1104
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,078
people

1105
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,719
are uh making by the usage of digital

1106
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,560
tools

1107
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,638
and the same for abortion clinics and i

1108
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,199
put abortion clinics in quotes because

1109
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,040
abortion is mostly legal illegal in

1110
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:01,359
latin america with deception

1111
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,520
uruguay and since yesterday in argentina

1112
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,319
but what they do is that sometimes in

1113
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,240
university forums uh in social media

1114
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,000
they advertise this abortion clinics

1115
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,118
which are not really abortion clinics

1116
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,079
but i like just

1117
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,440
um places where women go to think to

1118
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,880
have a safe abortion

1119
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,280
but it's actually places where they

1120
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,960
either convince women to not abort or

1121
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,000
like try to kidnap them so they don't

1122
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,000
report

1123
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,359
um this will be an interesting research

1124
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,800
to actually do

1125
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,560
and if you want to know more details

1126
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,000
about gender-based violence and how it's

1127
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,640
actually executed in latin

1128
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,920
america have an upcoming upcoming

1129
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,200
talking enigma around

1130
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,040
specifically this but let's move on uh

1131
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,399
to another topic and the topic is for

1132
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,040
billions as i said

1133
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,440
uh when talking about activist women's

1134
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:49,040
activist an lgbt ai

1135
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,839
an lgbt i a class activist and

1136
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,520
um uncertain over difficult different

1137
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,040
activists i have already said that this

1138
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,920
kind of minorities

1139
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,440
get all the time targeted civilians even

1140
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,520
if people don't want to call it

1141
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,960
uh surveillance itself it is in itself

1142
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,839
surveillance of these groups

1143
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,680
and targeted harassment of them but uh

1144
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,040
to the most classical civilians that

1145
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,720
people have in their mind

1146
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,480
the surveillance that is either mass

1147
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,078
civilians who target the civilians or

1148
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,800
political opponents

1149
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,240
and uh human rights activists let's talk

1150
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,160
it now in this point

1151
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,520
so already surveillance is also a

1152
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,359
question that has been asked when

1153
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,400
talking about privacy laws in latin

1154
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,480
america

1155
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,920
and one of the interesting debates that

1156
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,720
happened around the time was

1157
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,240
what is civilians if it's only like um

1158
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,919
if you have the data of someone and

1159
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,759
you're reading it as a human

1160
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,200
is the surveillance or that also

1161
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,760
includes like for example if there's

1162
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,160
machine reading meaning that if it's

1163
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,960
gathering your information and later

1164
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,118
creating

1165
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,880
advertisement based on it is that

1166
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,800
surveillance or not and there's still

1167
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,520
some ongoing debate around that

1168
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,040
i really like the definition made by eff

1169
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,800
in this report which is really

1170
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,720
good so you should read it if you are

1171
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,400
interested in which there is not

1172
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,839
surveillance not only about private

1173
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,760
communication reading private

1174
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,680
communication for another human being

1175
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,680
but also collecting monitoring

1176
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,960
intercepting analysing it

1177
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,598
using preserving it and retaining it

1178
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,440
so and what i like about this definition

1179
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,079
is also that it says past essential

1180
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,920
future

1181
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,920
because surveillance is not only about

1182
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,599
what is right now happening but also how

1183
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:24,000
much it has happened in the past

1184
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,760
in latin american legality itself latin

1185
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,160
american governments oftentimes allow

1186
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,800
some form of white harpinos civilians in

1187
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,160
the face of

1188
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,800
uh crime in many of the definitions that

1189
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,279
i have

1190
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,040
found um they allow in the face of crime

1191
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,520
if this is a serious crime

1192
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,720
if it's terrorism or is it to aid an

1193
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,800
investigation

1194
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,240
what exactly is a serious crime is not

1195
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,359
actually defined

1196
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,319
or when does a crime become serious what

1197
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,400
actually

1198
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,160
defines terrorism itself sometimes it's

1199
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,560
not actually properly defined

1200
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,640
or when to add an invade in aid an

1201
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,560
investigation is actually a good case

1202
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,279
for actually having white happiness

1203
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,359
actually also not really defined

1204
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,040
measure for the means of civilians is

1205
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,640
not really there

1206
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,079
so for example there's not really an

1207
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,319
instance in when they say

1208
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,160
that more when installation is allowed

1209
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,200
but in practice as you will see in a few

1210
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,040
slides that actually

1211
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,879
occurs and most of the times when there

1212
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,839
is more weather than it's been installed

1213
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,760
to target

1214
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,160
political opponents or human rights

1215
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,920
activists it's oftentimes more on

1216
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,279
software that is solved by global north

1217
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,320
companies which

1218
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,920
opens up many questions that i will

1219
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,000
cover in a few minutes in the case of

1220
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,440
location tracking also some kind of

1221
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,960
access is provided depending on the

1222
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,880
latin american country

1223
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,359
in colombia for example just to give an

1224
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,000
example it is required that

1225
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:44,880
telecommunications services

1226
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,119
um the two main ones in colombia claro

1227
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,760
and movistad and that will provide us

1228
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,280
hangover location data authorities in

1229
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,160
ecuador it's actually really

1230
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,079
easy to get location data about someone

1231
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,680
it was an incident for example if you go

1232
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,720
to the police and you say that someone

1233
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,319
is disappeared

1234
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,000
they will actually turn location

1235
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,640
tracking for that person in order to

1236
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,200
find it

1237
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,200
pretty easily but something that is

1238
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,160
oftentimes found in most of the

1239
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,399
laws of latin america is that well it

1240
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,879
says that authorities are

1241
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,480
can get access to location tracking

1242
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,400
there's no clear distinction around

1243
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,839
which authorities actually have access

1244
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,920
to this location tracking

1245
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,920
or even more is the authorities share

1246
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,520
between other authorities how is the

1247
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,280
sharing actually happening

1248
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:32,400
that's not really defined

1249
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,800
in the case of brazil colombia

1250
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,920
honduras they all have data retention

1251
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,240
obligation

1252
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,480
which uh requires that they lock vast

1253
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,959
amounts of data about the users and

1254
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,040
provide low informants access to it if

1255
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,880
they need it in the case for example of

1256
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,079
uh to aid an investigation of

1257
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,960
of or of a serious crime

1258
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,880
um in practice um this is really

1259
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,960
oblivious and opaque to the user

1260
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,880
sometimes there's sometimes

1261
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,440
some kind of notification that says that

1262
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,960
we're using a service this data is not

1263
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,319
but most of the time the user don't

1264
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,040
really know that this is indeed

1265
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,040
happening

1266
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,800
and if you ask an everyday person in

1267
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,200
latin america if they know that

1268
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,160
their data could be potentially used

1269
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,480
later for

1270
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,160
to aid an investigation or that it could

1271
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,880
be given the authorities most of the

1272
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,560
people will

1273
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,000
not really actually know that that's

1274
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,119
indeed what is happening

1275
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,880
and again there's no clearing

1276
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,240
distinction around which authorities

1277
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,720
have actually access to it

1278
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,160
so let's talk about in general about the

1279
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,680
question of civilians if there's

1280
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,200
actually master billions in latin

1281
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,960
america

1282
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,480
what it has been shown that in contrast

1283
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,359
to the global no there's not this

1284
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,119
traditional

1285
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,799
instance of mass civilians in the sense

1286
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,240
that they have not been really that much

1287
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,839
leaked documents that showcase that

1288
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,839
there's a plan from the government to

1289
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:48,560
actually surveil all the citizens

1290
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,839
at this scale um but there has been very

1291
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,880
much instances of

1292
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:56,240
uh targeted civilians um

1293
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,920
it could be and it's it's mainly

1294
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,560
reasonable to say that they could be

1295
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,720
massive billions but at least some

1296
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,839
so far we have not have that much of the

1297
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,919
examples of it

1298
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,759
so notable examples will actually target

1299
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,280
the civilian cell the software uh

1300
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,240
installed by colombia that's called

1301
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,599
esperanza

1302
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,520
and the other one that was sold by

1303
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:16,640
bering system that is called puma

1304
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,280
and this was on spy software um for

1305
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,000
telecom

1306
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,680
community telephone communication uh and

1307
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,520
it was targeted towards journalists

1308
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,399
political observation parties human

1309
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,480
rights activists

1310
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,440
and this was all done during the alvaro

1311
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,000
us government

1312
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,720
um in colombia most of the times they

1313
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,200
took way

1314
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,640
or the reason why they tried to justify

1315
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,960
that they bought this more when they

1316
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,279
bought this always because they tried to

1317
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,280
help anti-kidnapping operation and the

1318
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,319
extortion operation anti-terrorism

1319
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,079
anti-drug trade

1320
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,520
and this is a common thing all over the

1321
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,200
world that the reason why they say that

1322
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,079
the break-in to end encryption or that

1323
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,160
they need to buy

1324
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:53,839
more it's because they're trying to a

1325
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,759
criminal investigation of some kind

1326
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,839
citizen lab from the canada center for

1327
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,960
global security studies monkey school of

1328
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,799
global affairs

1329
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,880
actually rebuild existence of command

1330
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,560
and control servers from fiend spy

1331
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,880
the gama international team features

1332
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,880
remote nutrition civilian software

1333
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,960
in mexico panama and venezuela and

1334
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,480
paraguay and of course the spyware was

1335
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,280
developed by a german

1336
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,960
based company and the same happened in

1337
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,960
with the hacking team in other countries

1338
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,400
mainly in brazil colombia chile ecuador

1339
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,720
honduras

1340
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,800
panama and it was the same it was mainly

1341
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,640
targeted to political opponents it was

1342
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,760
targeted to human rights activities they

1343
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,720
were targeted

1344
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,400
for journalists um how it was bought

1345
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,839
that raises a lot of questions so why

1346
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,000
the global north countries and these

1347
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:38,640
companies were actually selling this

1348
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
market to governments in the legality of

1349
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,879
it these companies

1350
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,240
couldn't actually solid uh as it is um

1351
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,920
so they tried to find a

1352
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,000
legal way to actually sell it the way

1353
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,119
that they found it by using uh

1354
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,880
intermediate entire intermediaries

1355
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,160
um mainly for example in the case of

1356
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,640
ecuador there was

1357
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,160
a company a colombian-based company that

1358
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,279
was the one that was

1359
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,640
uh buying the software from the from the

1360
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,880
global north companies

1361
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,759
and then reselling it to colombia and

1362
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,920
ecuador

1363
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,839
another question is if it was safe to

1364
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,960
use in the sense to assist this more

1365
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:15,440
we're really doing

1366
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,119
only spying on the political opposition

1367
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,440
or whatever they wanted to spy and it

1368
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,839
was not backfiring and also logging

1369
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,000
data of the latin american government or

1370
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:26,720
the of the people that were inspired

1371
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,560
as we know now it was also doing that so

1372
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,200
there was not even a notion of the

1373
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,040
government's

1374
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,759
abortions of what actually they were

1375
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,160
buying and what about superiority what

1376
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,960
about

1377
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,118
actually buying another software uh from

1378
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,079
another country to actually fire you on

1379
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,680
your citizens

1380
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:46,240
um that raises a lot of questions

1381
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,040
in the case of secure messaging um what

1382
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,720
we have found

1383
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,800
is that there's not a lot of usage of

1384
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,480
actual security messaging in the sense

1385
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,240
of traditional secure messaging

1386
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,880
application that exists today

1387
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,439
in the case of signal in the case of why

1388
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,599
um

1389
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,520
many people in latin america use social

1390
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,520
media if they're activists they mostly

1391
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,000
use social media because that's the only

1392
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,400
way

1393
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,480
as they don't have access to mass media

1394
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,200
the social media gives them a way to

1395
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,839
access

1396
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,480
um to have a way to publish what they

1397
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,960
are doing

1398
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,480
in some kind of way and the the way that

1399
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,880
for example they operate

1400
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,640
how they are going to create meetings of

1401
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,480
what kind of a strategy they are

1402
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,598
developing is through the usage of

1403
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,520
whatsapp groups

1404
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,440
there's not much useful such signal that

1405
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,240
i have no no no no because

1406
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,880
it's not so known because it's too slow

1407
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,399
um

1408
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,000
specifically when i have spoken with

1409
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,280
journalists in latin america that

1410
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,520
sometimes has told me that they don't

1411
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,200
use it because it's too slow because

1412
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,560
people cannot really send documents

1413
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,359
through signal because they will take

1414
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,799
forever

1415
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,960
because it's too difficult to use some

1416
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,800
people say it and mostly because

1417
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,880
contacts do not use it so most of the

1418
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,960
people don't really use signal and

1419
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,480
so therefore they don't really use it if

1420
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,040
your family or your friends don't use it

1421
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,319
then you

1422
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:58,480
will not use it often something that is

1423
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,400
really used is telegram um because they

1424
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:03,599
have sort of a marketing campaign

1425
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,280
for um latin american activists so most

1426
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,240
of latin american groups actually use

1427
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,000
telegram

1428
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,000
all of the key messaging communication

1429
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,680
systems are highly used you hardly see

1430
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,440
people actually using otr

1431
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,879
or pgp because they are much more

1432
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,240
difficult to install

1433
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,760
so not really that much use um and what

1434
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,118
often happens is specifically we are

1435
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,680
talking activities about

1436
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,960
that uh fight for indigenous right is

1437
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,440
that they often don't have

1438
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,560
uh enough economic uh advantage to

1439
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,720
actually buy lots of

1440
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,560
smartphones and put signal into it or

1441
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,720
buy a lot of computers what they do is

1442
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,560
that oftentimes they have one desktop

1443
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,000
computer and they share it between each

1444
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,200
other because that's

1445
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,040
what they can um so in this case

1446
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,118
there's another really good solution for

1447
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,720
secure messaging for them

1448
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,280
there's one instance in which you can

1449
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,520
actually say that um

1450
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,240
there's a country who has actually asked

1451
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:57,119
um whatsapp to actually surrender

1452
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:59,680
uh encrypted data of someone to aid an

1453
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:03,119
investigation in this case it was brazil

1454
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:05,839
between 2015 and 2016 and because

1455
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,800
whata refused to provide this data it

1456
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,200
was blocked

1457
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,079
during that time which to this day

1458
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,919
there's still

1459
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,880
some debate about the legality of

1460
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,720
actually blocking it or not

1461
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,480
so as i'm running a lot of time let's go

1462
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,399
uh directly to some

1463
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,319
conclusions so in conclusion does it

1464
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,319
still need a lot to actually think of a

1465
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:25,920
lot in america in terms of the digital

1466
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,920
tools and the privacy of them and the

1467
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,400
civilians that you can actually make of

1468
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,839
them

1469
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,079
and that needs to actually be thinking

1470
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:34,160
of a latino american context and what

1471
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,280
means privacy to the region itself

1472
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,960
instead of just

1473
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,560
just thinking that we need a law so

1474
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,079
we're just going to just you know copy

1475
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,920
some of the same concepts and put the

1476
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,400
same into the latin american concept and

1477
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,400
all will

1478
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,240
work the same the same in the context of

1479
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,240
kovit that even though it's nice idea

1480
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,759
maybe to have tracking applications for

1481
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,520
kovid19

1482
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,040
if there are privacies preserving of

1483
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,119
course um

1484
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,960
but maybe in the latin american concept

1485
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,640
it will not make sense because not a lot

1486
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,160
of people have actually access to one

1487
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:04,078
smartphone that they carry around

1488
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,598
all day it's still a need to think about

1489
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,160
the data that's consumed by other

1490
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,560
countries

1491
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,399
um so mainly because the most of the

1492
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,078
people in latin america are using social

1493
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,200
media that is developed by other

1494
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,960
countries and

1495
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,560
mainly they're using facebook and what's

1496
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,040
up what actually means that

1497
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,558
the data gets a story in another country

1498
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,240
we need to think about the more we

1499
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,160
market and why certain

1500
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,399
companies from global north countries

1501
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:29,359
that actually sell in this malware and

1502
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,040
what does it mean and like what legality

1503
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:34,000
has that actually

1504
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,520
um what we know is that malwa is mainly

1505
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,839
used for targeted civilians

1506
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,599
specifically uh for journalists but it's

1507
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:40,240
highly used for digital gender-based

1508
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,599
violence

1509
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,279
i know that there's a lot of studies

1510
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,960
from the global notes for how malware is

1511
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,680
actually installed for sparse ware and

1512
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,079
other kind of

1513
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,919
things but it's not that much used for

1514
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,520
gender-based violence in latin america

1515
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,240
in latin america it's mostly about

1516
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,800
hacking

1517
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,399
social media accounts or like

1518
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,599
restricting the access

1519
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,359
to the device we need to do more

1520
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,000
research to actually know how digital

1521
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,640
tools in

1522
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,640
uh how harassment our digital tools

1523
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:10,319
actually impact the minorities

1524
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:13,920
what actually means for example for um

1525
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:15,839
women's rights activists or lgbt ai plus

1526
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,839
activists to actually be ha uh be

1527
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,558
harassed all the time and monitor all

1528
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,720
the time

1529
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,599
uh their activities uh through digital

1530
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,439
tools

1531
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,200
and we also need to think if there is a

1532
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,559
secure messaging solution that actually

1533
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,160
works in latin america

1534
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,640
for activists that sometimes don't have

1535
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,480
the same level of access to technology

1536
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,720
as they do have in the global north or

1537
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,240
the same access to the to the internet

1538
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,799
in general the connection of the

1539
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,598
internet

1540
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,200
as in the global north uh more details

1541
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,720
around all of this will be discussed

1542
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,319
actually at the panel that i will be

1543
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,160
inviting you now all

1544
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,599
um to happen maybe in january and

1545
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,759
february and to actually talk to people

1546
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:52,160
who have been doing all of this research

1547
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,920
um around what actually of the findings

1548
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,279
are and what we can actually do to

1549
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,200
actually think about

1550
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,119
and a specific way to create secure

1551
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,640
messaging solution or to think about

1552
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:04,240
privacy in a latin american context

1553
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,839
and just some time of reference if you

1554
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,520
want to read about privacy laws and

1555
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:08,799
putting some links here the same for

1556
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,800
surveillance

1557
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,640
um the same for cohesion when a stake

1558
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,440
occasion is covet

1559
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,640
domestic abuse um hater speech

1560
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,079
gender-based violence

1561
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,558
and all this um with that thank you very

1562
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,280
much

1563
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:26,640
and i don't know how the questions were

1564
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,640
but yeah thank you very much

1565
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,680
thanks a lot for that really interesting

1566
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,879
presentation

1567
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:48,240
um there is still time for uh for

1568
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:51,839
some questions here use our rc chat

1569
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:54,319
it's linked in the chat tab below

1570
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,880
in your video browser here and you can

1571

go to twitter and master on rc3

1573
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:06,319
iphone csh would be

1574
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:09,440
the hashtag

1575
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:12,800
so far let me quickly see

1576
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:15,760
yes no questions but i have a couple of

1577
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,839
questions so in the meanwhile folks if

1578
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,520
you're interested send us your questions

1579
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,520
they will be collected and forwarded by

1580
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:25,359
me in the meanwhile i

1581
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:28,800
have a couple of questions let's say

1582
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:32,078
to you until the others

1583
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:35,200
come up with their questions you said

1584
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:38,079
um that police treats

1585
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,200
females which have been harassed when

1586
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:42,240
they go actually

1587
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,279
to to indicate that there's something

1588
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,759
really going wrong

1589
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,400
as historical beings so the question is

1590
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,920
for me

1591
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,040
um that's a typical say male reaction so

1592
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,720
what's the

1593
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,520
the distribution between males and

1594
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,558
females in police in jurisdiction like

1595
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:00,319
for example

1596
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,119
um judges lawyers and so on and so forth

1597
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:04,640
so

1598
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:08,480
i suppose there is a certain in

1599
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:11,598
this equilibrium disequilibrium

1600
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:14,559
yes there is not a balance between

1601
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,200
the number of women in the police and in

1602
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,319
general

1603
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,960
in the judicial system in latin american

1604
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,800
countries

1605
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,880
even as far as going like for example

1606
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,839
women presidents in latin america

1607
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,839
are hardly a thing i can't think of an

1608
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:29,440
instance in argentina and chile and

1609
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,880
brazil

1610
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,640
in my country have not been an

1611
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,559
encouragement president although

1612
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,960
it should have happened because there

1613
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,800
was actually an ecuadorian woman who

1614
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,319
could have been the president but they

1615
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,960
didn't allow her

1616
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:44,880
any help but yeah there's always a

1617
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,559
disadvantage about it which actually

1618
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,480
asked the question if there will be

1619
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,160
women more women in the police or in

1620
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,040
legal authorities to actually believe

1621
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,799
women

1622
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,640
that could certainly be the case but it

1623
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,160
could also be certainly the case that

1624
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,040
even though there were women sometimes

1625
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,759
for women

1626
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,040
join mostly male dominated fields what

1627
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,319
happens is that they

1628
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:07,520
um integrate into the same uh

1629
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:10,720
pattern of thinking so they get more

1630
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:13,119
so they get more easily uh

1631
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,240
more easily so they feel more is it is

1632
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,640
that comfort

1633
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,919
uh on the work that they are doing so

1634
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,598
that could also be that

1635
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,760
even there are women that will be still

1636
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,319
treating other women reporting vats

1637
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,640
because

1638
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:25,839
um they have integrated into the same

1639
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,520
male thinking

1640
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:32,960
just to preserve the job okay

1641
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:34,160
well that's that's a sad story obviously

1642
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,119
i mean that's exactly the way it

1643
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:39,359
shouldn't work okay we have some uh

1644
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,800
questions flowing in so the first one is

1645
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,680
what is the reason for people not

1646
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,720
thinking

1647
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:47,200
about their own privacy what do you

1648
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,959
think about so in general i think that

1649
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,640
in latin america there's still in

1650
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,319
digital tools there's still not this

1651
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,000
notion that you are actually being

1652
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:55,759
surveilled and that the data that you

1653
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,119
are given to companies actually have

1654
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,160
some kind of

1655
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:03,040
um cost or that it has some kind of

1656
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,319
uh yeah that it has some kind of cost so

1657
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,240
what people think is that they

1658
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:08,079
only use social media as they will be

1659
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,319
using casual conversation

1660
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,440
they think they corporate uh social

1661
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,880
media with that like

1662
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,800
for example social media is the same

1663
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,440
with having a cultural conversation with

1664
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,520
someone

1665
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,280
meaning that after i finish this casual

1666
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,559
conversation it will go to the air and

1667
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,319
there's no record of it

1668
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,920
so there's this notion of that there's

1669
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:26,160
still some need

1670
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,720
to actually say no this actually is

1671
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,558
almost us writing something into a paper

1672
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,959
because it has the same level of

1673
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,559
storage it's it's not like only talking

1674
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,559
it's it's the same so that

1675
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:38,880
still needs to be actually pushed into

1676
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,480
the agenda maybe in the same education

1677
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,880
system to actually say

1678
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,000
the usage of social media or the usage

1679
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,240
of digital tools has

1680
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,920
indeed these actual implications and

1681
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,319
this this needs to happen i don't know

1682
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,319
if it's

1683
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:52,000
specific to latin america certainly in

1684
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,839
latin america happens but i think it's

1685
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
also in the world that people treat

1686
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:57,759
the usage of specifically social media

1687
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,920
and what's up as if it was like

1688
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,960
you know casual conversations but it's

1689
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,960
not actually the case

1690
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,359
great thanks for that elaborate answer

1691
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,520
um

1692
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,640
oh wow no it's good it's going on that's

1693
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,119
good we are

1694
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,319
having the questions now um can

1695
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,760
activists operate

1696
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:20,000
properly uh under the circumstances

1697
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,400
that they actually know that they're

1698
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,400
being spied on

1699
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,880
there has been some instances in which

1700
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,280
um activists have been actually targeted

1701
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,040
and

1702
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,720
sort of been aware of this there's a lot

1703
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:32,960
of journalists who actually been

1704
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,480
aware of this and in ecuador for example

1705
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,240
what they started doing is that they

1706
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,520
were started collecting the malware that

1707
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,279
they were sent

1708
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,799
um so there's like a little collection

1709
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,280
of the moment that was

1710
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:43,920
sent to them and they sort of realized

1711
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,079
this

1712
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,280
but there was no way for example they

1713
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:50,559
they sort of

1714
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,000
figure out this later um at the time

1715
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:54,160
they were already targeted

1716
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,920
because most of the time people don't

1717
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,759
have access in latin america to

1718
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,599
anti-virus software

1719
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,280
vs it's really expensive and your

1720
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,359
company will not pay for it

1721
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,760
or sometimes you install your antivirus

1722
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:08,319
software from up

1723
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,839
buying it in an illegal way the license

1724
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,200
in a legal way that happens a lot in

1725
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:13,790
latin america

1726
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:16,960
um so there's no way

1727
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:18,640
[Laughter]

1728
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,319
in the case it's also sometimes when

1729
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:24,078
governments actually targets

1730
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:26,000
um political opposition or activists

1731
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,920
they sometimes they don't know exactly

1732
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,799
how to target so there was one instance

1733
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,200
in one there was

1734
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:33,200
one judge in argentina who got killed

1735
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,960
and when people analyzed his phone

1736
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,480
they found out that he had more weight

1737
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,559
installed but the more we was not

1738
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,240
functioning because um

1739
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,079
because the mower was only to be used

1740
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,520
for a computer for a desktop computer

1741
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:46,720
but not for the phone

1742
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:48,640
so even the government sent this more to

1743
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,640
try to target him but it was not

1744
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,078
efficient because it was not for the

1745
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,920
purpose that they were wanted so

1746
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,040
sometimes even when governments buy this

1747
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,640
malware

1748
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,640
they don't know exactly how it works so

1749
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,078
they just only send it

1750
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,078
is there a way that they can keep

1751
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:03,200
working there's some ways that they can

1752
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,040
still work but

1753
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,200
most of the time what activists in latin

1754
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,640
america use is mostly they use social

1755
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,799
media and what's up

1756
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,240
and they get infiltrated quite heavily

1757
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:14,400
in the school groups um

1758
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,240
so they can try most of the times what

1759
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,319
they do is that they have uh

1760
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:20,399
have now created like a strategies on

1761
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:22,240
how to efficiently use social media and

1762
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,079
how to efficiently use what's up

1763
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,520
and if they actually need to come up

1764
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:27,760
with certain important

1765
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,440
decisions or certain important meetings

1766
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,440
what they do is that they

1767
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,440
gather themselves in person rather than

1768
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,799
using any kind of digital tools so

1769
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,200
that's like a common thing that they

1770
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:40,799
prefer to meet in person rather than

1771
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:44,879
using any digital tool okay

1772
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:47,359
yeah okay um there's a question actually

1773
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,680
about this panel you've mentioned um

1774
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:51,920
folks out there are not quite sure where

1775
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:54,240
how to find it so basically if you

1776
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,079
can comment on that that would be cool

1777
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,240
yeah so i'm still thinking of

1778
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,079
exactly what is going to happen uh

1779
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,319
there's yes to having people from

1780
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,440
the uh from article 19 from charisma

1781
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:06,240
from eff

1782
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:08,160
i did something similar uh on an event

1783
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,839
about secure messaging but that was with

1784
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,680
activists from hong kong and she did and

1785
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:12,960
this one is going to only be focusing

1786
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,720
like in america

1787
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,559
um i will put on my twitter because

1788
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,879
that's the way i bought it

1789
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,799
um i usually send it also to mailing

1790
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,920
lists last time i also send it at all

1791
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:24,079
mailing lists

1792
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,839
um but people have an idea for what are

1793
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,160
the mailing lists i can advertise this

1794
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:28,400
too

1795
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,078
i can also send it along it's very it's

1796
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,000
very in a hacky way in the sense that

1797
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:33,599
it's very self-created

1798
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,359
nothing like advertised by these

1799
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:38,319
companies so yeah

1800
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:38,319
you want to know about it

1801
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,240
just tell us your twitter my twitter is

1802
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,440
uh claus

1803
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:48,479
says wait uh yeah okay

1804
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:52,160
just tell us yeah there it is

1805
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,160
perfect that's the one we need

1806
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:58,400
very good um

1807
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,559
okay let me see we still have a little

1808
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:04,559
bit of time left now

1809
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:06,880
um maybe another question

1810
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:10,720
you were talking about data retention in

1811
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,720
several countries of south america

1812
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:14,000
are they usually then requested by

1813
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,480
judges or do you have

1814
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,839
some some information that this actually

1815
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:22,640
flows

1816
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:24,640
by some other weird let's say channels

1817
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,960
it flows by a lot of weird channels

1818
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:28,000
specifically sometimes police itself has

1819
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,359
access to this

1820
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,880
data that gets stored if it's important

1821
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:35,279
for a crime

1822
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,240
um i don't know how much resampling

1823
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,040
companies

1824
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:40,959
and that's a question to us in itself in

1825
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,799
for example in the companies who have

1826
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,839
access to the data that's been stored by

1827
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:48,079
the same companies

1828
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:50,078
if there's like some kind of internal um

1829
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:51,760
internal guidelines of how actually who

1830
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:53,680
has access probably not

1831
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,520
uh but usually the police is the one who

1832
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,759
has access or the

1833
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:59,359
or if it's in a serious crime and a

1834
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,400
crime when i say serious crime i mean

1835
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,400
something that it has

1836
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,000
it gets more like public attention or

1837
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,640
mass media attention

1838
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,520
um usually it's the prosecution usually

1839
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,839
is the judge

1840
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,799
those are the ones who have access okay

1841
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:12,640
okay

1842
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:14,640
um yeah we also got some some tech

1843
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,558
comments here basically so

1844
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,480
one person is saying what would it be

1845
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:22,000
what a cheap disposable live

1846
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:24,480
usb os uh be of help

1847
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,839
for for activists over there for people

1848
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,400
like tails ninja

1849
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:30,400
os or something like that it will

1850
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,000
definitely be your help um there has

1851
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,799
been some instances in for example

1852
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,520
the tool project actually um trying to

1853
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:38,160
reach out

1854
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,759
certain southern latin american uh

1855
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,680
activists and actually helping them and

1856
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:44,240
i know they have been doing lots of

1857
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,520
good work around that area we taste it's

1858
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,839
a little bit less because

1859
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,280
installing tails for people it's still a

1860
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:51,520
little bit scary

1861
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,119
um and sometimes they don't really know

1862
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,040
why they need to install tails

1863
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:57,280
and most of this operative systems that

1864
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:59,040
i have seen been used by activists

1865
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,799
specifically indigenous activists in

1866
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:04,079
latin america's windows

1867
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:06,480
um so yeah

1868
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:08,160
yeah yeah that's not the way but the

1869
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,280
other operating systems they're a little

1870
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,520
bit tougher to

1871
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,559
use and plus you said people are very

1872
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:15,200
very

1873
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:16,559
um let's call it illiterate when it

1874
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,720
comes to digital uh

1875
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:20,640
communication i mean they are using uh

1876
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,520
their phones and just think it vanishes

1877
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,879
in the air

1878
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,040
so i think it's really hard to

1879
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:28,240
communicate yeah

1880
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,720
use of those operating systems i mean

1881
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,959
there is

1882
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,839
also one i mean digital rights yes

1883
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,280
that's also

1884
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:37,200
part of the of the topic somebody's uh

1885
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:40,400
wondering if there are

1886
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:42,399
uh hints that manipulations were done on

1887
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,160
the level of

1888
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,520
elections do you know anything about

1889
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:48,000
that

1890
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,599
yes specifically in brazil there's a

1891
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,480
really interesting cryptography

1892
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,880
by the name of diego rana who actually

1893
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,040
made

1894
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,160
a huge research about brazilian

1895
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:59,040
elections

1896
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:00,480
um in terms of copies actually this is

1897
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,000
an interesting really interesting

1898
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,680
question because some governments have

1899
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,680
actually been proposing to do

1900
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:10,240
digital um ways to actually elect

1901
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,919
uh presidents to uh day they haven't

1902
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,919
come with a good proposal

1903
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,200
in terms of fiscal elections there's

1904
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,960
always manipulation

1905
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,640
in latin america in my country in

1906
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,119
ecuador there has been lots of

1907
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,400
scandals of actually fiscal manipulation

1908
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,440
of elections

1909
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,720
when they create uh for forge uh values

1910
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,680
when they

1911
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:31,520
toss out from like big containers of

1912
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,440
balance that they don't want

1913
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:35,359
so even in the physical sense there's

1914
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:38,799
still lots of effects around that

1915
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:40,160
okay sophia again lots of things for

1916
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:42,960
this

1917
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:44,000
interesting hour with you uh in the name

1918
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,839
of the audience in

1919
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,839
my name which is gracias

1920
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,839

1921
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,079
contacts
