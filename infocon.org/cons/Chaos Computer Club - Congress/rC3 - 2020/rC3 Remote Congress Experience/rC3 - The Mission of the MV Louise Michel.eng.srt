87
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,720
already heard

88
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,720
um this ship is a

89
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,840
search and rescue ship um and was bought

90
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,720
nearly one year ago it all started

91
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,560
with banksy writing an email to pierre

92
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,478
clem

93
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,840
offering a ship and then

94
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,719
after a few discussions the ship was

95
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,080
bought

96
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,199
and a group of a few people um

97
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,198
put many work many effort in it to

98
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:38,240
prepare a former navy french navy ship

99
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,040
into a certain rescue vessel the

100
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,440
preparation

101
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,720
when nearly all of them were done in

102
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,520
france in france

103
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,040
and the ship was brought then to boreana

104
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,240
in spain

105
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:54,320
and it's yeah turned

106
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:58,000
from a french navy boat into a

107
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:01,280
pink disaster and it's now

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,520
um again in briana spain um

109
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,880
we left for our first mission on the

110
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,440
fifth on the 18th

111
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,360
of august uh went to the central

112
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,479
mediterranean sea in front of the libyan

113
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,000
coast

114
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:17,360
and were involved of

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,400
rescuing almost 300 people

116
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,560
and after returning

117
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,080
to spain the ship didn't get detained or

118
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,000
didn't get seized

119
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:33,120
what we kindly or we were expecting this

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,639
so we are detained but the ship is

121
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,320
blocked

122
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,160
and now after the first mission a group

123
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,039
of people decided to keep the ship

124
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,320
to get the ship ready again for next

125
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,479
mission

126
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,759
um and that's basically what we are

127
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,320
working on right now

128
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,240
like getting a new registration because

129
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,440
luis michel was registered

130
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,240
as a so-called pleasure craft as a motor

131
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,240
yard

132
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,160
which was no problem at all because it's

133
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,880
obviously a pleasure craft and a motor

134
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,440
yard

135
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,080
so as long as authorities well they

136
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,160
didn't know

137
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,240
that we were supposed to do search and

138
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,360
rescue it was no problem at all

139
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,600
but after they found out that

140
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,639
we are doing search and rescue we lost

141
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,400
our registration

142
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,520
registration and are now

143
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,599
working on getting a new one and to be

144
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,880
able to sail again

145
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,080
and yeah so we are now in harbor doing

146
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,440
shipyard time

147
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,639
that means preparing the ship working

148
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,479
on problems stuff

149
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,919
that needs to be fixed on a ship which

150
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,639
is quite a lot

151
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,440
and yeah also doing a lot of paperwork

152
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,960
um

153
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,080
because as many of you also may know um

154
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,479
search and rescue is very political and

155
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,880
there are many political

156
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,240
issues let's call it like this that

157
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,440
needs to be fixed

158
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,919
many stones are they

159
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,719
put in our way and yeah that's what

160
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:06,400
we're working on right now

161
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,240
uh in the short description was already

162
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,758
said that we don't understand

163
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,160
s a r that normally stands for

164
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,039
search and rescue that we understand

165
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,440
this s s-a-r-s

166
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:24,080
solidarity and resistance um

167
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,960
that means what we are trying to say

168
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,719
with this

169
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,960
is that we are understanding our

170
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,160
activism or our acting not as a

171
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,638
humanitarian

172
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:38,319
thing but as political and

173
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:41,039
this is inspired by the central critic

174
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,759
that humanitarian work which is just to

175
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,440
say this

176
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,919
kind of in short uh the other metal

177
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,080
or the other side of the same metal so

178
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,000
humanitarian work tries to milder what

179
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,039
capitalism patriarchy

180
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,199
or racism do to

181
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,520
and with the world and

182
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,120
it makes it makes the that's going

183
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,560
on looking better

184
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,960
um but it's

185
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,840
it's making invisible what all these

186
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,840
structures of power

187
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
um

188
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:21,680
cause see this is racism this is death

189
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:24,799
this is uh yeah

190
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:28,319
this is they make the structures of

191
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,400
inequality and power invisible

192
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,640
and this is kind of what also our

193
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,919
project is about not

194
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:39,439
only going to see saving lives because

195
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,199
the obviously the eu is not willing or

196
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,560
i mean they are definitely they would be

197
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,680
able to do it but they are not willing

198
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,839
to save lives

199
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:50,800
or to um stop people from drowning

200
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,920
so we are definitely this is part of our

201
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,319
project but

202
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,079
um part of our project or the main part

203
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,279
of our project is definitely

204
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,760
to put some effort in changing the whole

205
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,320
system

206
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,839
because as hannah already said like

207
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,519
capitalism and

208
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,080
definitely racism they cause the death

209
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,160
that we can see at our borders

210
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,440
especially in the mediterranean sea

211
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,600
so without capitalism without racism

212
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,480
and also without the patriarchy there

213
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,320
would

214
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,080
be not such a problem like there

215
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,959
wouldn't be so many people drowning at

216
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,680
sea

217
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,640
and this is that's what we mainly

218
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,839
understand

219
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,920
what we should do like

220
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,760
say bringing effort and changing the

221
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,040
system

222
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:41,120
and that also means

223
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:45,279
that our our actions

224
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:48,480
have to be followed by the doubts

225
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,320
and have to be reflected

226
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,760
so we have to reflect on what we are

227
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,760
doing and

228
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,600
uh not get caught by the stupid game or

229
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,080
this disgusting game that is played by

230
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,360
national states by the european union

231
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,240
or by all those authorities who

232
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,440
trying to force us to work on stupid

233
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,880
registrations

234
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,399
so what the main situation is um for us

235
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,360
and also for all other

236
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,959
rescue ships is that we are blocked that

237
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,200
we are hindered

238
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,719
um that the european union stopped all

239
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,360
the rescue programs

240
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,920
they had um the

241
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,680
the the central mediterranean is still

242
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,000
the most deadly border in the world but

243
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,640
it's not

244
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,839
the only dead deadly border in the world

245
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,680
borders at all

246
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:43,279
are killing and causing death

247
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:46,399
and torture and suffering

248
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:49,439
and borders are

249
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,959
imaginary lines or boundaries are

250
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,600
imaginary lines

251
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:58,160
that have been set up at some point and

252
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,200
it makes the people believe that there

253
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,839
is something

254
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,000
that has to be protected um

255
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,480
[Music]

256
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
but it's the national borders or the the

257
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,720
borders of states are not the only

258
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,519
borders

259
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,440
we are struggling with and there are

260
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,000
also borders

261
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,040
between or boundaries that we have to

262
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,920
cross

263
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,439
like gender like racism like capitalism

264
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,800
like inequality

265
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:28,079
uh maybe i can hand over

266
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,160
yeah like what hannah already said

267
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,359
like the boundaries not only exist

268
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,240
between countries

269
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,880
and states or even continents but also

270
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,320
between

271
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:41,360
human beings between people and this is

272
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,399
something we also seen like a lot on

273
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,480
ships

274
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,600
all of us worked on different kind of

275
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,240
ships

276
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,360
and we've seen a lot of borders a lot of

277
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,000
boundaries

278
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,720
whether they were quite visible or most

279
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,240
of them were

280
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,760
more invisible between people

281
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,600
and the reason for that or the reasons

282
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,079
for those boundaries i think you said

283
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,920
them already uh mostly

284
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,560
gender uh the color of of the skin of

285
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,319
people

286
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:15,760
um the level of education people have

287
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,800
and all this stuff is causing boundaries

288
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,920
between people

289
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,399
and borders between people and we

290
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,760
as a political project not we are not

291
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,800
only trying to fight

292
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:30,160
the borders between countries

293
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:33,279
and helping or we're trying to

294
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,279
put effort in helping

295
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,120
people across those borders between

296
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,320
countries but also

297
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,839
helping people and forcing or

298
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:47,279
um not only forcing bits

299
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:50,480
challenging ourselves to cross those

300
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,120
borders that society teached us

301
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,880
to to live within so we're also trying

302
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,360
to

303
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,800
yeah as i said help people but also

304
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,040
challenging ourselves to cross

305
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,839
those borders that exists in our head

306
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,800
and that

307
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,399
are very invisible from time to time but

308
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,560
when you work as a crew

309
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,959
they get you can feel them you can't see

310
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,199
them but you can feel them

311
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,518
and this is maybe something that we can

312
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,800
say as one of our main understandings so

313
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,200
we don't see

314
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,359
when we talk about migration or when

315
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,200
when we talk about people on the move so

316
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,279
migration is everything it's also

317
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,000
migration when i move from berlin to

318
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,839
spain because i think i like

319
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,040
the beautiful or the warm weather more

320
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,560
this is awesome

321
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,160
there's nothing like this and i mean the

322
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,279
weather is quite nice we are in spain

323
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,439
right now and it's

324
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,800
it's just wonderful to be here to be

325
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,519
honest

326
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,479
um but this is also migration migration

327
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,199
is also when you

328
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,000
move from from the landscape or from the

329
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,079
land side

330
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,360
to the city but it's not framed as

331
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,279
migration

332
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,279
and i think

333
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,720
there it's it's always a difficulty to

334
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,160
go somewhere else

335
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,160
and people who are crossing the borders

336
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,800
of the european union

337
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,600
we don't understand this as as fleeing

338
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,920
people who need

339
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,880
our urgent help and support but we

340
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,240
understand

341
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,079
this movement there's a kind of

342
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,120
challenging borders

343
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,760
so because i don't accept these

344
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,160
imaginary lines that they were told that

345
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,560
they are not allowed to cross

346
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,719
freedom of movement is a is a basic

347
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,319
rights of human beings and should be

348
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,839
like this and this is something that we

349
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,079
should stand for

350
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,880
and so then the people always say like

351
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,479
okay

352
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:40,160
there's eg an institution like forentex

353
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:43,440
that is a policy

354
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:47,680
uh military organization and

355
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,800
in 2011 they were told to accept a new

356
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,000
rule that means

357
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,560
they are not allowed to do pushbacks

358
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,240
because they do push backs but what else

359
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,239
do we expect do we have

360
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,839
someone who is controlling bodies and we

361
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,680
expect that these people controlling

362
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,399
bodies will say to someone who wants to

363
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,319
cross it

364
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,920
oh you're not allowed and they expect

365
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,399
that the opposite will say

366
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,760
ah yeah cool i will go home again that's

367
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,839
not how it works

368
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,760
and this leads to a situation of

369
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,880
violence because as soon as this

370
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,600
border is not accepted uh and someone

371
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,320
crosses

372
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,240
anyway it will have an effect and that's

373
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,020
what we are facing at the moment

374
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,380
and at the very moment where um

375
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,380
[Music]

376
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,959
sorry i need a second i lost my point

377
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,040
we were talking about the moment that

378
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,279
people cross borders without

379
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,770
having the permission to cross them yeah

380
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:50,720
but the loss is just gone

381
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:54,079
[Music]

382
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,680
so maybe i can jump in until hannah

383
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,359
finds her point and i think her point

384
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,479
was pretty good

385
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,440
so i would love her to get back to that

386
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,800
but when we were preparing this talk we

387
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,759
also talked about

388
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,319
um who was even able to to draw the

389
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,199
lines

390
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,839
as borders like for example frontex is

391
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,639
protect

392
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,600
protecting the border between for

393
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,880
example

394
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,839
african states and european states

395
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,639
um and but there are so many other

396
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,360
borders

397
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,839
and we figured out in our heads that

398
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,240
it's

399
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,360
always the most powerful position who is

400
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,639
able to draw those

401
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,240
lines as borders and when it comes to

402
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,759
borders or boundaries between

403
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,480
people that it's also again the most

404
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,560
powerful

405
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,320
powerful position that is drawing this

406
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,439
line and this

407
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,480
should be should be changed

408
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,120
so it should not be this powerful

409
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,199
person's

410
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,720
deciding where the boundaries or the

411
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,279
borders are

412
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,320
um and who is allowed to live within

413
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,480
which border

414
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:03,680
like for example

415
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,559
this man decides this is the border

416
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,039
between

417
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,559
uh a male and a female person who's

418
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,720
deciding this this is just

419
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,319
stupid and same for borders between

420
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,120
countries like

421
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,159
uh european state is deciding so this is

422
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,559
the line and

423
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,760
i'm a european person so i'm allowed to

424
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,240
live within this line

425
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,919
and all of you should just off and

426
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,039
stay outside

427
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,160
and you can just put this into many many

428
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,440
different situations

429
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:36,240
i think borders are

430
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:39,200
a matter of distinction and it separates

431
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,760
uh people from each other so while it is

432
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,320
saying

433
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,320
you're different than me because you are

434
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,918
a male and this is a female or because

435
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,240
you're white and it's black and that's

436
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,440
your passport and that's your passport

437
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:56,160
and maybe you don't even have a passport

438
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,160
and we

439
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:05,120
we are mostly talking

440
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,200
in our crew about uh gender borders

441
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,639
about and this is something that makes

442
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:14,080
that makes sense when we

443
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:17,360
are when we understand a ship as

444
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,480
as a place or as a space of hierarchy of

445
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,199
patriarchy

446
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,960
that is it brings bad luck when you have

447
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,640
a woman on board that's a story that's

448
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,960
told

449
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,880
and we had this talk also yesterday that

450
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,400
we have a funny fireball

451
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,960
that you can throw into the fire when

452
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,520
there is a fire and i will explode

453
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,480
and there's a picture on it and you see

454
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,559
a male

455
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,000
who is throwing like very nice and

456
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,080
slightly into

457
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,520
into a fire he's definitely the hero of

458
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,799
the situation

459
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,000
as this and there is a fault there's

460
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,120
also a pictogram

461
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,480
of a woman and she's putting this

462
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:59,760
ball from the top into

463
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:03,120
burning oil very nicely very nicely

464
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,720
she's smiling and this stands for

465
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,159
something that we are facing

466
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,520
when we as nazis males enter

467
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,080
a space like a ship we notice

468
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,840
every day that's we are kind of in the

469
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,000
wrong place

470
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,799
we notice that it's different when you

471
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,520
go alone through a part

472
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,000
uh we have all these visible things that

473
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,440
we can talk

474
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,880
about so when you have a male chief

475
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,799
engineer it's a male chief engineer you

476
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,880
can say this is a powerful position

477
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,639
but there are so many things that you

478
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,360
can't that you can't see

479
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,360
that clearly

480
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,080
um yeah so there are this

481
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,080
visible boundaries but also like

482
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,120
invisible boundaries so we were also

483
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,480
talking about

484
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:51,280
what what what is changing when you

485
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,240
have uh for example this man coming on

486
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,520
board the ship

487
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,840
what does this create like what feelings

488
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,320
change and how feelings change and how

489
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,080
behavior also changes

490
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,360
and what does it make with the whole

491
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:09,760
crew and maybe all of you also have

492
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:12,719
situations in mind when you were only

493
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,280
for example this female or flint persons

494
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,799
in a

495
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,480
project or in a room and how this was

496
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,360
how you were working together how you

497
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,520
were living together and as soon as

498
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,479
as this man is entering the room the

499
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,559
project

500
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,600
how this is changing and this is also

501
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,080
about

502
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,840
boundaries between people i think and

503
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,720
it's challenging us a lot so

504
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,320
always when we try to grow mostly flint

505
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,840
people so we try to

506
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:43,039
to turn the usual um

507
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,360
what is anomalous yeah the usual normal

508
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,960
fat

509
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,459
long sorry for the english speaking

510
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,840
presence i have no idea um

511
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,679
[Music]

512
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,600
so usually these rooms are structured

513
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,799
that if you have women on boards

514
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,240
or flint people on board uh when you

515
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,520
have like one or two

516
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,640
and the rest that's his meds and maybe

517
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,320
also saying that

518
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,200
on many many ships the flynn person

519
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,879
is doing the crew care or the for ngo

520
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,919
ships it's the guest care

521
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,520
positions like many medical departments

522
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,559
are made of

523
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,000
we can say like a woman and guest care

524
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,720
and crew care is

525
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,280
like are mostly female positions but

526
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,679
when it comes to engineers or captain or

527
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:32,080
officer positions this is

528
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:34,080
mainly just my positions no those are me

529
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,240
and that was what i was about to say so

530
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,399
we are doing crewing for the ship and we

531
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,760
try to prove mostly flint's

532
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,080
persons and that also means that we can

533
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,919
open the doors

534
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,000
or that we are kind of the door keepers

535
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:52,880
and we can open the doors for

536
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:56,159
um for those people who

537
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,600
usually have much

538
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,919
uh more difficult to enter such a

539
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,600
project or to enter such positions

540
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,520
that they can take over when they are

541
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,520
entering luis michel but of course it's

542
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:12,559
a story about

543
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:14,799
being exclusive and um

544
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,200
we have we are struggling a lot with the

545
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:20,960
fact that we are still

546
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:24,240
uh working in a surrounding that is

547
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,679
uh super masculine

548
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,159
dominated so always when when we are

549
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,520
looking

550
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,440
for people who can take over uh the

551
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,240
the powerful positions like being a

552
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:40,720
captain an officer a chief engineer

553
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:43,840
um we are we're

554
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:48,400
having a wide range

555
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:51,439
of cis men's who offer their support

556
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,159
but on the other side there's no one

557
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,640
and this is something that is really a

558
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,760
problem and it takes as much time

559
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,440
um to deal with the situation because we

560
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,158
want we really want to stick to this

561
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,520
idea

562
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:08,480
of creating a kind of uh as

563
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,440
possible that could be a kind of safe

564
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,280
space

565
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,559
and

566
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:15,039
[Music]

567
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,280
because we experienced that the

568
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:21,039
surrounding and the climate on the ship

569
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:24,399
is definitely another one when you have

570
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:27,360
uh a most flint crew so

571
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,200
there's more space you can give for

572
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,399
trust because people come

573
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,080
and say when they don't trust themselves

574
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,520
to do something or when they don't feel

575
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,960
comfortable with something there's much

576
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,158
more talking there's much more

577
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,279
reflecting

578
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,080
um it's super easy to hand over

579
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:46,640
jobs when you have a climate that allows

580
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,760
not to know

581
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,159
when you have a climate that allows you

582
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,679
to be weak because this is a ship and

583
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,039
when it goes out and there's a problem

584
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,640
that nobody said like oh i made a

585
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,600
mistake but maybe i just cover it with

586
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,799
something

587
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,918
um no no no no no don't do it

588
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,039
and then it's important that someone

589
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,440
comes and says i don't know how to do it

590
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,440
and

591
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,919
maybe this is or this is at least what

592
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,918
we

593
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,919
have seen during the last month when we

594
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,320
were working together

595
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,840
on this ship as a new crew and with many

596
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,360
different people coming from

597
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,199
different countries from different

598
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,279
different environments

599
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,480
that or at least it's my experience i

600
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:30,880
don't know what about you

601
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:34,240
that it was many times it was

602
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,520
what were women asking for help

603
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,640
or being less self-confident

604
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,279
and trying to like double check when it

605
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,880
was

606
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,960
on the other hand like men always

607
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,080
jumping in like being much more

608
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,840
self-confident and

609
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,840
maybe it's for reasons and it's totally

610
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,399
fine but i think this is

611
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,120
how we grew up how we got educated and

612
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,320
what

613
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,879
society teached us how we should be like

614
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,600
women always being or many times being

615
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,480
very

616
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,320
or less self-confident than men are and

617
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,919
this is something we try to challenge on

618
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,158
this ship like empowering

619
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:12,840
women to be at least as self-confident

620
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,159
as the men are or as the men trying to

621
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,720
go

622
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,960
try to be um

623
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,039
[Music]

624
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,480
maybe we should come to an answer i

625
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,760
think now we're at the point where we

626
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,640
can talk

627
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,520
like a lot more about all these little

628
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,919
lines

629
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,520
that we are crossing every day and it's

630
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,200
not just about dishwashing

631
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:37,120
and uh taking care of the engine room

632
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,799
we can take talk about a lot about the

633
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,479
engine because our chief engineer has

634
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:44,080
his day off so he's not here

635
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,240
and we can't say a lot about him

636
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,279
and

637
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,400
[Music]

638
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:53,840
but i think

639
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:57,600
for for all kinds of

640
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:01,120
political action uh the main thing is

641
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,719
that we we have to

642
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,959
um we have to stay and maybe sometimes

643
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,960
we also have to improve it

644
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:13,440
uh the enmity with the circumstances

645
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,320
and by keeping the friendship to the

646
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,039
world or with the world

647
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,000
and so we are trying to create a kind of

648
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,720
an open space

649
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,679
by never accepting any kind of

650
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,440
water that is

651
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:29,279
dropping or crossing our ways so we are

652
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,760
we have to reflect we have to force

653
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,720
ourselves to step about this so to cross

654
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,200
these birds

655
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:40,960
to step over it and to not getting

656
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,279
getting lost or desperated or frustrated

657
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,520
and this is what we can be so we can

658
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,679
create a space where even when we are

659
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,320
blocked and it always feels kind of

660
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,799
senseless

661
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,399
to get these second parts sitting around

662
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,000
don't know what you're doing

663
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,600
because while we are sitting here and

664
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,039
everyone's talking about this lovely

665
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,320
pink little ship

666
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:03,039
uh that's tries to challenge

667
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,399
european bodies we are in the end we

668
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,000
have to say we are blocked

669
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,679
but somehow we also have to deal with

670
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,760
this frustration we have to go on so

671
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,159
there's no possibility to say like okay

672
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,200
they forbid us to do this so we can't

673
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,440
accept that

674
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,159
but at the same time we have same time

675
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,399
we always have to challenge ourselves

676
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,360
and we always have to support ourselves

677
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,360
and

678
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,799
we have to we have to understand

679
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,678
ourselves as

680
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,679
part of social media movements and this

681
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,039
is why we really appreciate to get some

682
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,559
questions

683
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:37,840
um from the audience to get some

684
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:40,480
something more than this limited space

685
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,120
we are living in here yeah maybe as a

686
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,080
conclusion we can say that we are not

687
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,080
only fighting or dreaming of a world

688
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,600
without borders between countries but

689
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,320
also

690
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,120
for a world or we have this vision of a

691
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,439
world without

692
00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:00,080
borders between humans and in any kind

693
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,080
in any way

694
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,459
[Music]

695
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,320
virtual applause you're getting from the

696
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,158
audiences you can

697
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:25,120
sadly cannot hear that but uh i am sure

698
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,799
that uh there's a massive feeling of

699
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,360
gratitude and thank you

700
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,000
uh from all of those who are watching

701
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,360
and i've

702
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,799
uh got some questions for you

703
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,039
from the audience and uh if we've

704
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,799
still got some minutes left so when you

705
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,840
have an additional question

706
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:46,480
use the irc

707
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:50,360
below the video or use twitter or the

708
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,720
fetiverse using the hashtag

709
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:56,320
rc31 in letters so

710
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:59,679
hashtag rc number three

711
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,639
letters o n e

712
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,799
then our signal angel will uh put that

713
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,799
down in the pad so i can

714
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,480
ask the question and the first question

715
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:12,080
uh coming into you

716
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,799
um uh for you is have you had any

717
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,000
direct confrontation or other experience

718
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,520
with frontex

719
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:23,120
officers or boats

720
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:26,158
um maybe i can answer the question

721
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:29,840
um so

722
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:33,360
yes uh definitely yes when you go

723
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:36,639
in to the mediterranean sea when you go

724
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,760
um yeah in front of the coast of libya

725
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,279
for example

726
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:44,000
um you can basically

727
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,360
nearly every day see frontex airplanes

728
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,960
um

729
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,439
crossing like uh searching for boats

730
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,960
uh searching for ngos what the hell are

731
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,799
they doing there

732
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:59,520
and yeah so it's from what

733
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,399
i experienced during the missions um i

734
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,720
went on

735
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,879
it was mainly airplanes that were

736
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,120
searching for

737
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,480
um for example boats and distress or

738
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,080
people on the move

739
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,000
and giving this information

740
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,039
unfortunately not

741
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,520
to ngo ships for example or

742
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,158
informing coast guards in in the way

743
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,320
like okay

744
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,120
those people need help but informing for

745
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,158
example the so-called libyan coast guard

746
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,039
to go there to push the people back and

747
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,799
that's

748
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:34,000
definitely one of the main experience

749
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:37,360
i made with frontex like

750
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,720
organizing illegal pushbacks

751
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:44,559
okay so most of uh

752
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:48,000
of it was plane sightings and not direct

753
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:51,200
contact with personnel or or

754
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,399
ships and touching distance

755
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,519
okay so the the next question is uh

756
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:59,120
more of a technical side i think the

757
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,399
core of the question

758
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:05,600
uh was about uh how to uh

759
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,080
great situations but i uh trying to read

760
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,719
that

761
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,639
uh to read that out i think some

762
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,480
something is lost in the translation you

763
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,679
i hope you see what that means but take

764
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,880
it in a

765
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,279
a good manned spirit

766
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,799
uh how do you define a maritime

767
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,840
emergency

768
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:26,799
dash or slash ship

769
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,439
wreckage do you already take action for

770
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,360
a dinghy with a working motor

771
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,720
and rescue them or is it only about

772
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,320
situations where

773
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:39,600
people's life is crucially endangered

774
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,320
where is there some guideline that you

775
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,360
can

776
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,360
yes oh

777
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:53,919
great what's happened total ask her this

778
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,919
question what yes

779
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:59,099
[Music]

780
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:14,640
no i think it's not our internet i think

781
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:17,679
it's just the audience

782
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,679
[Music]

783
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:28,170
i just saw the chat explode with all the

784
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:33,969
technical stuff

785
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:33,970
[Music]

786
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:43,840
what's up

787
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:53,940
[Music]

788
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:59,700
i have so many good questions

789
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,320
i would like to ask but uh yeah

790
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,559
[Music]

791
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,918
technicalities are the great dictator

792
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,480
and we are allowed to go

793
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:13,840
four minutes over right

794
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,159
i'm preparing to go four minutes over

795
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,158
okay

796
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:27,130
when we'll ever be back

797
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:33,319
it's good

798
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:33,319
[Music]

799
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:41,689
i'm freezing

800
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,689
[Music]

801
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:53,840
all right

802
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,069
[Music]

803
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:21,839
[Music]

804
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,839
give me a go and then i start

805
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,190
[Music]

806
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,839
so second question um maybe something is

807
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,359
lost in the

808
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,960
uh trans uh uh translation but uh take

809
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,918
it in a good spirit

810
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:49,119
um this is about technicalities how do

811
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:52,239
you define a maritime emergency

812
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,399
ship wreckage do you already take action

813
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,199
for a dinghy with a working motor and

814
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,359
rescue them

815
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,720
or is it only about situations where

816
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,480
people's life

817
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,799
is crucially endangered

818
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,520
as soon as you enter the central

819
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,640
mediterranean sea and try to

820
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,880
make it from eg libya to italy

821
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,598
with a dinghy with a small engine even

822
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:19,040
if it's working it's a distress case

823
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,520
yeah okay yeah and to be honest it's not

824
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,440
only

825
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,839
if the engine is broken down or if

826
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,000
there's already water coming in but

827
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,359
those dinghies are normally super

828
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,920
crowded

829
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,799
and you never know about the weather

830
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,440
coming up

831
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,960
because me personally i always had this

832
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,800
idea of the beautiful center

833
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,160
central mediterranean sea with nice

834
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,200
weather and no waste at all

835
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:44,720
but that's definitely not the case so

836
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,200
um yeah i think it's not always about

837
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,560
this

838
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:51,200
super dramatic scenes but the santa said

839
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,240
as soon as you enter those boats this is

840
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,799
not a good idea

841
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,759
and and it's it's quite a distance and

842
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,320
it will take

843
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,920
several days to get there right so it is

844
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,480
it is not a

845
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,520
pleasure cruise or something no i would

846
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,440
not say so

847
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:10,400
not in general okay next question

848
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,960
uh is the crew also trying to overcome

849
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,040
hierarchies on board

850
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,599
means are they trying to find structures

851
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:21,119
that work without classical captains

852
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:25,040
uh etc yes

853
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:27,680
yes and yes i'm sorry go ahead

854
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,880
so there is there is a legal side of the

855
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,919
things

856
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,119
and when the ship is on the sea and one

857
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,040
is operating

858
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,760
the person who is responsible is always

859
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,160
the captain so the person who's facing

860
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,440
all the legal consequences are those in

861
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,640
powerful positions

862
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,520
and this is something that we have to

863
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,920
keep in mind but um

864
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,720
for all decisions that are made on the

865
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,440
ship

866
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,000
it's not up to the captain or the louis

867
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,200
louis

868
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,359
who's the coordination on the mission or

869
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:02,799
to the uh few

870
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:06,078
powerful positions we have um the

871
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,800
decisions get made by all and we are

872
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,000
trying to

873
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:13,440
keep it as as flat as possible and

874
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,520
of course everyone's allowed also to say

875
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:20,640
um his or her opinion

876
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,720
his or her opinion and it's going to be

877
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,920
acknowledged but we have to be honest

878
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,959
about that we

879
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:30,079
have to challenge ourselves to to

880
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,200
make this running to work like with this

881
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,520
flat hierarchy we yeah

882
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,520
we are on it we are far from perfect but

883
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,520
we are trying to improve ourselves every

884
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,560
day

885
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:45,599
good okay from uh

886
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,240
again uh from the nice people of the

887
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,599
signal angel crowd uh have written me

888
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,759
down another question

889
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,440
have there been other attempts to

890
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,000
sabotage your work

891
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,880
except the legal challenges of the ship

892
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,960
license

893
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,720
maybe attempts to distract you from

894
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,760
complicated work maybe

895
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,640
even algorithmic driven behavior

896
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,240
recognition

897
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,830
or something this is more of a technical

898
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,459
question yeah

899
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:10,460
[Music]

900
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,200
i think i didn't really got the question

901
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,800
but to be honest this legal

902
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,040
this legal side of the things is quite

903
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,040
effective so there was once the question

904
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,359
if we can't just leave as a pirate

905
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,480
ship without a flag without a flag and

906
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,920
if we do so

907
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:33,359
uh that's an invitation for all forced

908
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:36,400
uh power of all what is it

909
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:39,359
armed forces to enter our ship and

910
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,200
uh this is quite effective and i think

911
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,920
the main problem is with all kinds of

912
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,000
repression

913
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,560
and that's how police work also works

914
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,480
is that it is not just trying to block

915
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,920
you or to

916
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,599
sanction you but it's also about

917
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,000
destroying structures and this is what

918
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,079
we

919
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,200
have to work on in all the structures we

920
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,240
are organizing

921
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:02,240
to not let them destroy our

922
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,520
our networks our connections our

923
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,520
relations and everything else

924
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,119
okay so the this legal action works

925
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,839
really

926
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,240
really well so the uh of uh i've given

927
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,359
some

928
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,040
uh uh context uh for this

929
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,400
do you think that you're constantly

930
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,160
surveyed by

931
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:25,760
others so that they can throw sticks

932
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,759
into the spinning wheels

933
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,720
we definitely have to keep this in mind

934
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:33,279
like all the time we would not

935
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,839
talk about very sensitive stuff or we're

936
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,400
trying

937
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:42,240
really hard to protect our data and

938
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,920
yeah so but i mean we are not sure about

939
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,160
this but we have to keep this in mind

940
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,800
are we keeping this in mind

941
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,200
um and there's another uh question about

942
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,320
uh

943
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,720
about the hierarchy on board um more

944
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,160
specific what decision making processes

945
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,919
do you use on board

946
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,359
do you want to give us some insight on

947
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,160
that

948
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,839
yes of course uh we do have we are

949
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,359
organized with a small crew

950
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:09,520
like a car crew who's coordinating

951
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,279
and is also kind of decision making this

952
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,520
is sometimes a problem but

953
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,880
the ship always works independently of

954
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,839
this crew

955
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,760
or this core crew and the crew who is on

956
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,240
board is organizing themselves so they

957
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,319
can

958
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,680
organize themselves as having a very

959
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,800
structured day like

960
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,720
everyday morning meetings or try to

961
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,400
find other ways to at the moment the

962
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,000
situation with the current

963
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,599
crew is that we have our construction

964
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,720
sites that we are working on but

965
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,079
everyone is free to

966
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,078
organize themselves so if they want to

967
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,680
work up to 11 in the evening they are

968
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,400
more than welcome but we will stop them

969
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,279
at some point because we don't want

970
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,720
we have an anti-burnout policy so then

971
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,720
they also have to start later

972
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,079
so no we don't have we don't really have

973
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,920
a plan but we are trying to

974
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:01,839
um to give the communication

975
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,440
to those of the organization to those

976
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,920
who are doing it

977
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,119
that means the ship organizes itself and

978
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,000
this core crew

979
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:12,000
uh is trying to to to care about the

980
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,880
organizational sides of the things that

981
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
means

982
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,839
uh caring about money about uh

983
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,079
registrations the legal perspectives the

984
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:23,680
legal

985
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,160
aspects um but at least we are always

986
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,799
giving

987
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,399
a big thing or a big part of our

988
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,359
responsibilities that we have as a core

989
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,640
crew at the moment

990
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,799
leonard near part of the car crew and

991
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,480
the ship crew is doing their own

992
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,800
organization together with us

993
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:44,240
so yeah yeah

994
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,640
um for information for uh the studio

995
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,078
i'm planning to go four minutes over and

996
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,118
i'm already one over

997
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:55,040
so there's room for two more questions

998
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,720
um uh after having rescued people do you

999
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,599
social distance

1000
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,118
them because of their unknown health

1001
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,319
status

1002
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:06,319
this is a corona related one

1003
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:08,400
uh yeah lovely i'm so happy to talk

1004
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:11,520
about this

1005
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,880
aren't we all yeah great um

1006
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:18,720
finally so um yeah after

1007
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,760
uh the rescue we um tried to

1008
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:25,118
put like to wear masks and um

1009
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,760
to hand over masks to our guests

1010
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,760
and for sure the guests they had to it

1011
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,000
was mandatory for them to karentine when

1012
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,440
they

1013
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,359
came on land in italy and

1014
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,560
we try to make everything possible to

1015
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,640
keep

1016
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,880
the guests healthy like protecting them

1017
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,279
from our possible infection

1018
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,800
but also trying to protect the crew from

1019
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,800
getting infected

1020
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,319
so this is a small boat we have to be

1021
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,960
realistic it's not

1022
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,240
possible to like social distance like

1023
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,880
two meters just like

1024
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,078
there's no way but we do everything

1025
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,520
possible to

1026
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:02,480
yeah contact us and protect other people

1027
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,119
and i think we have to add to this uh

1028
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,319
that

1029
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,440
this corona thing is used from the

1030
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:10,960
authorities

1031
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,640
to stop us because they say it's not

1032
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,119
possible at

1033
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,759
some ngo ships to keep the social

1034
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,040
distance

1035
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:23,520
to um ban the

1036
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:25,599
pandemic and to be honest

1037
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,720
when you look at the situation on the

1038
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,839
mediterranean sea

1039
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,240
when you have the question about

1040
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:32,560
drowning or spreading corona

1041
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,680
i would prefer spreading corona yeah so

1042
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,078
we

1043
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,359
we think corona should not be an excuse

1044
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,560
to close harbors

1045
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:43,920
or to block ships because

1046
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,799
as um yeah as you all know treat first

1047
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,520
what kills first

1048
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,560
and drowning kills you first and kobuna

1049
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,520
is quite a bad thing

1050
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:54,799
and very serious but it should not be an

1051
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:57,920
excuse to close our borders

1052
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:01,839
yeah and uh follow up on that

1053
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,160
how do you you said uh in your talk that

1054
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,839
the

1055
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:08,799
luis michel is a safe space

1056
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:09,119
do you advertise or announce this is uh

1057
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,240
in

1058
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,280
any way when you uh rescues

1059
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,520
somebody do you have a uh do you have a

1060
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,560
standard uh procedure where you say

1061
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,640
listen this is

1062
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,000
a little bit different as other ships or

1063
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,359
something like that or

1064
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,839
how do you approach those uh you you are

1065
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:29,279
rescuing and inform them about that i

1066
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,920
think it's not the first step

1067
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,040
but how do you uh do this kind of

1068
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,319
information

1069
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,480
i would just say first that we are not a

1070
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:41,599
safe space but we are trying to get as

1071
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,040
close okay um

1072
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,760
and the rest i have to hand over to

1073
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,920
leona we are definitely talking

1074
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,079
to our guests about this telling them

1075
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,240
that we are living

1076
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,280
all on a very clear close or a very

1077
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,959
small space

1078
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,160
and that yeah this is a safe space so

1079
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,359
there's no place for

1080
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:03,520
racism or any kind of discrimination

1081
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,279
weapons drugs whatsoever so this is

1082
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:09,040
definitely a topic

1083
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:12,000
and it works at least what i experienced

1084
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,279
it's it wasn't a problem at all so there

1085
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,319
was a huge respect

1086
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,119
from the people on the move and from the

1087
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:21,040
crew

1088
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:24,160
