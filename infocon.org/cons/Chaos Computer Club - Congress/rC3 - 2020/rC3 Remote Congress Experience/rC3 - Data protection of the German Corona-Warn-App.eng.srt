1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,798
yeah hey and welcome back

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:10,400
to the sea bass channel and uh it's

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,160
once more about corona but this time

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,440
it's about the corona apps

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,039
and the data protection in decentralized

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,640
corona apps

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,680
and kirsten reiner will do a talk about

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,840
looking beyond the code as always you

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,480
can ask questions in the chat which we

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,480
will

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:34,000
answer later on and now have a

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:38,160
fun and lots of information with uh

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,160
heiner and kirsten go ahead thanks a lot

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,839
so welcome to our talk data protection

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,919
of decentralized corona apps looking

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,680
beyond the code

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,440
this is talk specifically about data

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,200
protection and not so much about ic

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,399
security as we have heard

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:58,640
a lot of interesting talks before and

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:01:02,320
um yes so

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,120
this is the schedule for today um

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,120
and so

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,680
and we will start

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,360
with the introduction of us and kirsten

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,560
maybe can say a few words

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,400
about yourself thank you thank you so

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,479
much for having us today

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,720
um my name is kirsten i'm a data

30
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,679
protection expert and i work for

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,679
german dpa i have a legal background i

32
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,920
tweet under privacy de

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,680
and i was part of the team for a german

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,159
exposure notification

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,119
app data protection impact assessment

36
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,400
draft in

37
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,759
april and today i will present my

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,799
private opinion

39
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,479
thank you my name is

40
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,799
reiner rehack i have a background in

41
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,039
computer science and philosophy

42
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,200
um i am a researcher at the weitzman

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,360
institute for the networked society

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,640
i'm active at the forum computer

45
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,399
professionals for peace and social

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,840
responsibility

47
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,439
and my fields of interest are data

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,840
protection and i.t security

49
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,679
as well as government hacking and i was

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,840
part of the team together with

51
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,640
kirsten to create the data protection

52
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,160
impact assessment in april

53
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,160
and now we will have a short overview

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,040
about the talk

55
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,480
yes um first we will start with with

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,120
what is data protection

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,640
quite important question when when

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,720
talking about data protection to

59
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,559
understand the basic subject

60
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,080
and then we will learn some details

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,560
about the german corona

62
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,000
app which is actually exposure

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,480
notification app

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,480
we will learn a bit about what is a data

65
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,518
protection impact assessment

66
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,238
our findings and what was missing in the

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,720
official

68
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,800
data protection impact assessment and

69
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,840
finally we will have some time for open

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,239
questions

71
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,120
but first let us start with what is data

72
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,519
protection

73
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,519
right now

74
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,239
so first we would like to differentiate

75
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,080
with the question what is data

76
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,120
protection between data protection

77
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,480
data protection law and i.t security

78
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,040
data protection itself is a research

79
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,000
area in social science the idea there or

80
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,480
the goal is

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,239
to avoid unwanted consequences of data

82
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,720
processing

83
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,239
data protection law is the legal field

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,159
that tries to implement that

85
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,680
but it's the legal form of it and we all

86
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,120
know sometimes

87
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,799
the laws don't really protect what

88
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,000
they're intended to protect so there's a

89
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,680
difference between data protection and

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,360
data protection law

91
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,360
and the third thing that needs to be

92
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,720
differentiated is i.t security which is

93
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,280
in a research area

94
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,879
in computer science which is mainly

95
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,120
about confidentiality integrity and

96
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:45,840
availability of data and services

97
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,599
and we see here there's already um

98
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,319
there's already a differentiation

99
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,399
because

100
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,760
um the data protection itself uh

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,920
protects the people

102
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,000
that are subject to data processing

103
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,958
whereas i.t security protects the data

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,439
and systems

105
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,879
of the people operating the systems so

106
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,120
we already see there's the first

107
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,120
there's the first difference and

108
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,599
the current data protection law

109
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,879
is the ugdpr the general data protection

110
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,959
regulation

111
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,918
and it protects the fundamental rights

112
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,880
of people

113
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,039
see article 1. i've put it out there the

114
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,040
regulation lays down rules relate

115
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,360
relating to the protection of natural

116
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,960
persons and it protects the fundamental

117
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,160
rights and freedoms

118
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,359
of natural persons um and

119
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,080
generally in in the

120
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,280
data protection law in the gdpr the main

121
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,400
questions are

122
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,000
um the processing itself the purpose

123
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,080
the risks involved and who's the

124
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,120
controller so who's responsible

125
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,359
um and such things

126
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,400
um and one thing that needs to be

127
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,120
mentioned especially

128
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,000
when we talk about the the any kind of

129
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,320
processing

130
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,160
is questions of proportionality

131
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,120
suitability and necessity

132
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,360
so for all data protection processes

133
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,120
it's important to ask

134
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,360
is is this data processing

135
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,720
suitable to reach the aim so is there a

136
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,639
causal relationship

137
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,240
we all know that there are certain

138
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,160
applications where that

139
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,400
are intended to reach a certain goal but

140
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,479
we maybe as tech people

141
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,638
or tech people might not all be tech

142
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,800
people listening or watching here

143
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,560
sometimes it's just not suitable so from

144
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,479
the perspective or data protection

145
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,400
this would then not be illegal

146
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,800
processing if it doesn't causally

147
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,280
relate to the aim the necessity is

148
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,800
is there any less intrusive measure to

149
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,000
reach the same goal

150
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,960
then the proposed one is not uh is not

151
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,320
allowed because

152
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,638
less infringing one or less intrusive

153
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,840
one

154
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,160
would be available and finally the

155
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,638
proportionality

156
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,759
so the goals that can be reached

157
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,479
compared to the

158
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,560
rights infringed that needs to be put in

159
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,599
in context and in relation

160
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,199
and um this is this kind of

161
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,960
understanding or this kind of evaluation

162
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,720
has to be done for all processing

163
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,400
so right now we see that's the first

164
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,400
problem with the corona

165
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,318
with exposure notification being done by

166
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,479
the corona one apps

167
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,360
we don't really know how well it

168
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,479
actually works

169
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:25,360
which in effect makes it difficult to

170
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:28,159
make this kind of evaluation um

171
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,759
but if we leave this a little bit away

172
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,800
it's still very interesting and this is

173
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,039
what we will

174
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,120
continue to do now is to evaluate the

175
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:39,360
risk of the actual usage

176
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,919
um but um and there's also a specific

177
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,600
tool

178
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,960
so we it's not like people sitting

179
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:49,840
around the table and just thinking about

180
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,840
the risks

181
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
oh

182
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:22,240
oh beautiful all right

183
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,120
oh oh oh

184
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,360
is that okay again all right so i feel a

185
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,840
bit like an airplane that has been

186
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,840
refueled in mid-flight

187
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,520
okay so should i

188
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:47,280
okay should i continue or

189
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,280
okay maybe

190
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,639
we'll probably

191
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,680
we'll skip this probably in the

192
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,559
recording then so right now i could sing

193
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:13,840
the

194
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:13,840
jeopardy melody

195
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:20,099
[Music]

196
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:40,959
there we are okay wow this was

197
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:44,080
quick should i continue now

198
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:46,239
okay all right so um

199
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,279
as i said it's necessary to analyze all

200
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,680
this processing

201
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,399
and for this kind of analysis analysis

202
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,120
there's a specific tool in the gdpr

203
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,000
um which we will hear about later by

204
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,720
kirsten

205
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,279
but first before we talk about the tool

206
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,200
um

207
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,399
we want to talk about the corona app

208
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,000
itself just to

209
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,120
outline the general functionality for

210
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,640
everyone who's not

211
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,120
familiar this will be rather quick

212
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,680
but it's important for people who are

213
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,760
not

214
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,359
constantly dealing with a topic so

215
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,920
what's the corona warn app it's a

216
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,880
voluntary transnational

217
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,399
bluetooth low energy approximate

218
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,120
proximity tracing

219
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,720
um it's the same technology or that's

220
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,360
being used by for example the app in

221
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,839
ireland in japan or in italy

222
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,959
etc the purpose of this app is to break

223
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,560
infection chains

224
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:41,199
by warning possible infectious exposures

225
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,000
so it tries to trace contacts between

226
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,839
people

227
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,839
and if one of the persons

228
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,480
is tested positively then the second one

229
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,399
so the contact can be warned

230
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,720
uh for self um quarantining

231
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,320
um the whole system although we are

232
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,560
always talking about the corona app it

233
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,279
consists of an app and a server which is

234
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,760
important

235
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,760
looking at it from the data protection

236
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,079
beta protection perspective

237
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,000
and there are more things but because of

238
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,279
time we're not focusing on this

239
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,120
um within the app there are two buckets

240
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:19,360
like two let's say storages um

241
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,600
one bucket is for the bluetooth beacons

242
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,440
that are being sent by each app

243
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,240
and one of the buckets is for the

244
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,600
bluetooth beacons received by other apps

245
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,200
those bluetooth beacons are let's say

246
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,720
pseudorandom and they change

247
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,839
but this should not be the topic right

248
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,839
now and

249
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,440
the interesting the interesting aspect

250
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,560
is upon a positive test

251
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,360
of one person the bluetooth beacons that

252
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,920
have been

253
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,440
sent in this one bucket are uploaded to

254
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,760
the server

255
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,120
and then all the other apps are

256
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,839
regularly downloading

257
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,040
all those beacons from the server and

258
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,959
they can check

259
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,199
with their second bucket if they have

260
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,719
seen any of the infected buckets so

261
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,040
that's kind of the idea

262
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:08,399
so the warning um is um

263
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,640
is being calculated uh decentrally

264
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,519
on them on the apps on the mobile phones

265
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,959
themselves

266
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,560
and if there's a warning so if it

267
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,399
detects you have been close to someone

268
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,599
who has been later tested positive then

269
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,680
you should solve quality

270
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:24,480
that's the basic idea um

271
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,319
and as we see this is a let's say a

272
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,760
transnational

273
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,560
effort for contact tracing this is a new

274
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,680
technology

275
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,079
and it's just uh difficult to assess

276
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,040
this

277
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,760
and as i've mentioned before um there is

278
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,640
a tool

279
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,319
to do this in a structured way so now

280
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,959
custom will tell us what

281
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,680
a data protection impact assessment is

282
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,079
and what we can do with this

283
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,519
thank you um the data protection impact

284
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,638
assessment is a legal

285
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,880
requirement resulting from article 35

286
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,839
of the general data protection

287
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,040
regulation

288
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,279
which describes in which situation

289
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,560
data protection impact assessment must

290
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,439
be conducted

291
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,959
and also the obligations a controller

292
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,360
has to comply

293
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,079
with whenever a data protection impact

294
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,160
assessment becomes necessary

295
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,680
and needs to be conducted prior to

296
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,000
processing

297
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,319
to assess the impact of fundamental

298
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,600
rights of new types of processing

299
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,079
technologies

300
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,440
large amount of data or processing on a

301
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,920
large scale

302
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,680
of special categories like health data

303
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,360
as collected via the

304
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:39,040
the um exposure notification apps

305
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:42,320
the the aim of a dpr

306
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:46,000
what we call it as an abbreviation is to

307
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,720
aim to detect problematic collection

308
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,680
and linkage of information and to

309
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,240
prevent them

310
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,638
by implementing appropriate measures or

311
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,519
to prevent the processing as such

312
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,079
if it bears the risk of resulting in

313
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,480
profiling and other high risks

314
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,920
for fundamental rights of natural

315
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,320
persons

316
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,279
so profiling and its consequences

317
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,000
constitutes

318
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,959
grim infringement or fundamental rights

319
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,320
and

320
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:18,239
therefore it is quite important

321
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:21,360
to to find all kinds of processing that

322
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,920
may lead to such a profiling and to such

323
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,600
risks

324
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,319
of course um and to allocate these risks

325
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,600
properly it

326
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,160
is important not only to focus

327
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,440
on the app but to focus on the whole

328
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,639
process

329
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,279
so including

330
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,079
the interfaces of course that an app

331
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,199
uses

332
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:46,880
but uh also

333
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:48,719
the the the processing operations that

334
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,000
are very closely connected and

335
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,600
that only gives sense to having

336
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,399
such a notification app at

337
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,920
all and the problem with the main

338
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,399
problem with the official

339
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,040
german data protection impact assessment

340
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,079
was

341
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:10,000
that it it basically focuses

342
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:13,279
on the app and the server and leaves out

343
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,800
very important aspects of the processing

344
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,120
and that for example

345
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,439
is the google echo apple exposure

346
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,720
notification

347
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,480
and we still up to this day don't know

348
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,279
exactly what is going on

349
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,760
uh when when this feature is being

350
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,160
included and used

351
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,730
in the app so this is this is quite a

352
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,199
shortcoming

353
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,240
[Music]

354
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:42,240
another main focus of a data protection

355
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:45,279
impact assessment is that a controller

356
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,160
may also be the main attacker

357
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,079
and not not only third persons or

358
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,439
external persons that may

359
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:56,239
attack the processing operation

360
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,600
so when you conduct a data protection

361
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,639
impact assessment you

362
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,720
always have to focus on you know does

363
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,800
the controller actually need this kind

364
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,959
of data is it necessary

365
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,839
and does he have in place the

366
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,160
appropriate

367
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,800
technical and organizational measures to

368
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,240
ensure that he's only processing

369
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:19,519
what he's actually uh needs to

370
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,000
to um to to to follow

371
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,839
and uh to conclude the the main

372
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,680
objectives of the processing

373
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,920
um actually

374
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,399
there are not many uh data protection

375
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:36,240
impact assessments around so far

376
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,959
um and uh as a consequence

377
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,800
in germany um there was or i don't know

378
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,880
if it was a consequence but

379
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:47,519
at as shortly before um the corona

380
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,320
app was being published it was clear

381
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,560
that um

382
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,920
there was no public data protection

383
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,239
impact assessment

384
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,560
and that data subject had not been

385
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,880
included in the process of the

386
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,000
assessment which is a prerequisite

387
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:07,360
from article 35 so we

388
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,320
decided in april to

389
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,120
go on and analyze what was known at that

390
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,160
time

391
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,440
uh about the about the app uh and

392
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,560
provide what you might call a draft of

393
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,600
a a data protection impact assessment

394
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,719
and which then actually is served as a

395
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,720
background for the official

396
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,800
impact assessment done by by the

397
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,920
government as being the controller

398
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:38,560
of the whole processing um our

399
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:42,079
findings in that in that data protection

400
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:45,839
assessment was that um there is quite

401
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:48,800
a difference um

402
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,600
in terms of voluntariness when you

403
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,160
consider

404
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:57,279
you know voluntary using an app

405
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,839
and uh um and

406
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,439
and and in different uh uh under

407
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,880
different preconditions

408
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,600
and um also uh

409
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,559
the question of voluntariness in terms

410
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,520
of the legal

411
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,760
basis because voluntarily voluntary

412
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,799
doesn't necessarily mean consent as a

413
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,879
legal basis

414
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,959
which is one of the legal basis that is

415
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,919
provided by the gdpr

416
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,039
and um which which could be used but

417
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,720
there's also

418
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,439
the option of a voluntary use based on a

419
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,880
specific

420
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:35,360
law and this would have a

421
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:38,160
a number of positive consequences

422
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,280
as opposed to constant being the legal

423
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,200
basis

424
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,879
because according to a data protection

425
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,799
law a legal basis

426
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,720
which is always required when you

427
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,918
process personal data

428
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,559
um we found that constant is not

429
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,600
an appropriate legal basis because it

430
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,720
requires you

431
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,678
to be able to to to take to take

432
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,400
to or to consent freely in an informed

433
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,320
way

434
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,360
uh and uh that were that were conditions

435
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,000
requirements

436
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,559
that would have to be uh still have to

437
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,280
be met

438
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,000
by each and every individual user in

439
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,360
order

440
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,720
um to to be a legally valid

441
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:22,000
uh consent and this as you

442
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:25,039
can guess is is quite quite uh a

443
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,320
difficult uh task uh to to

444
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:31,520
to make sure that every user of the app

445
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,799
actually chooses to use it freely uh and

446
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,760
informed um so it would have much

447
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,520
much been much better uh if the

448
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,200
government would have decided

449
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,480
to provide a specific law

450
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:50,240
for the voluntary use and also

451
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,600
to put down the purposes

452
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,960
specify the purposes and center them on

453
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,080
contact tracing

454
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,640
exclusively and to preclude other

455
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,678
uses such as you know using the app as

456
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,240
an intern

457
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,960
entrance token for supermarkets for

458
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,080
example concerts workplaces

459
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,360
um and so on and actually today we see

460
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,360
the same discussion

461
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:18,799
um now uh uh concerning um

462
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:22,479
the vessel assassination um where

463
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:26,000
also we find that you know being being

464
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,960
or having already received the vaccine

465
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,760
may be used as an entrance token and

466
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,559
therefore

467
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,120
um we believe also for the corona warn

468
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,799
up that

469
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,239
an app that sorry um that a law should

470
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,440
have been in place

471
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,720
to govern this it also

472
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,720
could have actually

473
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:52,240
also worked for

474
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:55,679
excuse me much higher acceptance

475
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,880
uh and proper usage of the app

476
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,520
um well and another uh

477
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,280
one of our big findings and and this is

478
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,039
something that has always been

479
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,960
uh discussed in public also and

480
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,240
is whether the question whether the app

481
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,760
is working

482
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,880
on an anonymous basis and in our

483
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,840
data protection impact assessment we

484
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,960
show

485
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,080
that the the the app indeed

486
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,799
processes personal health data and this

487
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,039
uh that generally no data on a personal

488
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,240
uh personally used smartphone is

489
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,640
anonymous

490
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,640
so uh we always have to deal with data

491
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,240
protection issues in this regard and we

492
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,880
shouldn't be talking about

493
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:43,360
an anonymous use of the app

494
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,480
and that's basically why in data

495
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,959
protection

496
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:51,440
we cannot only look at the code used

497
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,080
for such a processing but we have to

498
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:58,000
take the whole process in context

499
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,840
into consideration um

500
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,960
and well uh rhino how about

501
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,080
anonymization yes i will take

502
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:09,280
on the last two points um

503
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,760
um that we now have seen that um the app

504
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,520
itself

505
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,840
is not anonymous it doesn't mean that

506
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,918
parts of the data at par

507
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,039
within parts of the processing can be

508
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,200
anonymous

509
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:23,679
anonymized so the whole idea here is

510
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,799
once as long as the data is on the

511
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,919
mobile phones

512
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,320
it is personal data well you can imagine

513
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,960
if i

514
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,280
if i can read out all those tokens and

515
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,360
then i can compare them with the

516
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,760
um with those tokens maybe saved on the

517
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,840
server i could theoretically

518
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,799
make a combination and then say who's if

519
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,959
the phone

520
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,480
i took from someone if that person is

521
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,919
actually infected or not

522
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,880
so that shows that it's that the data

523
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,440
connection is there um but this doesn't

524
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,240
mean that

525
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,039
on the way of uploading those those uh

526
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,880
bluetooth

527
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,400
beacons to the server it would not be

528
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,559
possible to anonymize that

529
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,520
but this is a difficult process it is

530
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,158
possible

531
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,600
that those personal data on the phones

532
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,440
is being uploaded and

533
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,000
goes through an anonymization process

534
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,840
and then is anonymous on the server

535
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
so this is exactly the data protection

536
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,399
view um where you would say

537
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,400
there is a part of the process where the

538
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,320
same data which is personal data on the

539
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,799
phone it is anonymous data

540
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,520
when it's on the server but the process

541
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:28,799
how it gets there is very very important

542
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:32,000
um as you might

543
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,840
think now well if you upload those

544
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,200
well after you have a positive test and

545
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,360
then you upload um

546
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,240
via the app your bluetooth beacons to

547
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,678
the server

548
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,840
of course the server receives and has

549
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,159
your ip address so

550
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,080
by this point it's of course possible to

551
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,799
connect via ip address

552
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,720
um an ip address is personal data those

553
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,200
uploaded beacons to

554
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,760
an individual so what does what does

555
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,360
telecom and srp say at this point

556
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,520
um and what they say in the data

557
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,158
protection impact assessment is

558
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,960
yeah for an indefinitely small amount of

559
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:07,600
time we do have this connection but we

560
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,400
actually don't save it trust us we don't

561
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,280
save it

562
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,720
and here we see again uh there's the the

563
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,320
main difference if you see the

564
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,080
controller is the attacker

565
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,840
then of course you should not trust the

566
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:22,399
attacker saying well

567
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:24,959
of course i'm not saving this um so

568
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,679
that's that's the main problem um but of

569
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,320
course this

570
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,520
uh this risk can be mitigated but it

571
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,918
should be mitigated

572
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,600
um one way we are suggesting in the data

573
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,159
protection impact assessment would be to

574
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,480
say

575
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,720
well maybe you have this uh the server

576
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,120
who stores it it is within a network

577
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,960
but the entrance node to the network is

578
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,918
operated by a different organization

579
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,360
and all this all the main tasks this

580
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,760
other organization has

581
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,000
is to strip the it ip addresses and then

582
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,960
forward the data to the servers of

583
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,320
let's say the archie so this would be an

584
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,320
organizational solution

585
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,360
this is not a technical solution but it

586
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,840
still

587
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,279
is a protection for the data subjects

588
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,600
and that's why

589
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,799
hence the talk this you can't really see

590
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,959
this in the code because

591
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,918
this would be part of the network design

592
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,520
and there we see we

593
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,240
always have to look at the at the whole

594
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,799
processing um

595
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,720
and at the same time it would be nice

596
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,440
for example as a protection measure to

597
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,640
have a law

598
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,919
that forbids um law enforcement or

599
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,080
intelligence agencies

600
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,840
going to those organizations to say well

601
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,120
could you just keep those logs on for a

602
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,639
short time because we need this

603
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,399
information for whatever reason

604
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,880
so it would be good idea to have a law

605
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,159
that prohibits this kind of

606
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,320
change of purpose so there we see that

607
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,919
it is possible to do anonymization of

608
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,720
those bluetooth beacons while they're

609
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,480
uploaded

610
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,480
but it has to be done properly and

611
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,080
should not be as in the official data

612
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,760
protection impact assessment

613
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,240
brushed away by saying well we just

614
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,879
don't save this information

615
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,159
you know we all know mistakes happen

616
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,440
that's

617
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,080
that's the least dangerous scenario we

618
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,559
can see

619
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,439
uh mal intent will be something else and

620
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,320
the last point

621
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,200
um that we found is uh as kirsten

622
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,520
already uh

623
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,039
mentioned a little bit um the exposure

624
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,200
notification framework

625
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,559
uh and the relation to apple on google

626
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,440
of course we would know

627
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,840
that's a really really crucial aspect

628
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,000
and

629
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,959
we would not say you should not use it

630
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,440
but it's

631
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,080
it should be honestly stated that there

632
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,240
is a risk

633
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,520
and this risk has to be mitigated the

634
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,000
official data protection impact

635
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,000
assessment

636
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,200
says well we can't access the source

637
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,919
code so it should not

638
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,039
so that because it's not solvable it's

639
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,880
not a problem

640
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:41,200
no the the task of an impact assessment

641
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,240
would be to say there is a risk and

642
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,720
because of

643
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,679
close source code at this point it's not

644
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,799
possible

645
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,320
to mitigate this risk so it's okay if

646
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,080
this cannot be solved but it should be

647
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,799
stated as that and that's that's a big

648
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,960
problem

649
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,480
um if we just say yeah everything is

650
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,000
like it is and so we can't change it and

651
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,480
so everything is all right then why do

652
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,919
we do

653
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:05,200
data protection right um

654
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,960
and um um

655
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,880
yeah and it would be certainly possible

656
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,880
to ask maybe data protection

657
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,120
agencies should audit should be able to

658
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,559
audit the code of apple and google

659
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,120
or maybe it would be possible to

660
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,600
to find other ways and since we spent

661
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,239
several

662
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,918
um 10 millions on this app it's

663
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,760
frankly quite surprising that the team

664
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,440
about the micro g project

665
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,840
presented a free implementation of the

666
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,400
enf at least for

667
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,918
android and suddenly people without any

668
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,880
google connection can use it on their

669
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,480
android phones

670
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,799
and i was just thinking okay if this is

671
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,679
one if they would understand how crucial

672
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,520
this role is

673
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,720
at least you could rescue the android

674
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,480
users you know

675
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,799
in in this aspect but there are many

676
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,640
other ways as well how to how to do it

677
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,158
um but this would be a consequence if

678
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,760
you would take data protection really

679
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,080
seriously

680
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,840
and this is not this is not some some

681
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,279
fancy magic

682
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,360
this is just data protection done

683
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:05,279
seriously

684
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:07,678
um right okay

685
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,039
so this is um so maybe at this point

686
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,120
props to the micro g

687
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,400
project and maybe apart from our data

688
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,799
protection impact assessment

689
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,520
don't donate to those guys to actually

690
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,760
make this app

691
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,639
better and more usable and more broadly

692
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,559
usable

693
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,559
to people okay

694
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,520
so now kirsten will continue with some

695
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,720
of the open questions

696
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:33,679
yes thanks well apart from technological

697
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,159
issues proportionality of processing

698
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,039
we believe should still or again be

699
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,080
discussed

700
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:43,039
you know what what is the added value of

701
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,678
the app for contract tracing we don't

702
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,200
know

703
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,399
up to this point um it seems still an

704
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,399
experiment

705
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:53,439
we if we look at other countries

706
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:56,479
especially in the asia pacific area

707
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,039
we see that contract tracing by an app

708
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,240
has

709
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:03,360
actually not been a major

710
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,799
uh a tool to

711
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:09,120
to fight the pandemic um we should

712
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,200
take a closer look at the side effects

713
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,158
of civilians habituation of the

714
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,520
populations to a surveillance tool

715
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:20,399
i i believe this is a real big problem

716
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,960
um which hasn't been considered at all

717
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:25,918
you know using a a smartphone

718
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,720
to to being you know traced and and to

719
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,159
have

720
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,840
uh uh uh you know to to to know that

721
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,159
somebody's looking over your shoulder

722
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,879
and

723
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,919
who whom you are meeting even though uh

724
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,520
it seems to be

725
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,559
uh uh on a on a beacon uh in a beacon

726
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,520
kind of way

727
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,960
um it's it's still something that

728
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,799
affects your brain

729
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,279
um and the fact uh that other smartphone

730
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,760
apps

731
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:54,080
you know this is always an argument or

732
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,000
or something that's brought forward

733
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,960
uh that that smartphone apps illegally

734
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,919
spy on users does not justify

735
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,600
that this app does for for the purpose

736
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,799
of contract pricing

737
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,600
um it's not a no go but

738
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,000
we believe that proportionality has to

739
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,719
be

740
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,440
carefully very carefully considered and

741
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,679
that is

742
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,679
it has not been done properly so far

743
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:24,080
well this is from my side um

744
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,720
yes and i'll i'll just take on the next

745
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,799
point um

746
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,080
um maybe just one comment right when we

747
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,120
refer to the uh

748
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,360
to um uh the corona

749
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,479
approach in countries like taiwan which

750
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,479
is not the

751
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,240
the mega civilian state it's a

752
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,039
democratic country so

753
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,000
um um they don't even have an app right

754
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,320
so this is uh

755
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,279
such a upkeep but coming back so and

756
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,600
even if we

757
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,120
now we have the app and now we um we all

758
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,360
want to see it to flourish

759
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,158
the question is why is the development

760
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,120
still so

761
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,799
deficitary or so deficit where is the

762
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,678
functionality about the crowd

763
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,279
notifier uh this the the draft is

764
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,720
already there the source code is

765
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:10,159
nearly written so to have another

766
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,600
data field which is a crowd so whenever

767
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,600
you go to a restaurant you could maybe

768
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,959
scan a qr code there's a possible way of

769
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,639
actually implementing this in a data

770
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,159
protection friendly way

771
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,880
um why is the micro g approach not

772
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,600
gotten part of the official app so once

773
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,120
it finds

774
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,520
you don't have google or anything

775
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,678
installed then it will be using this

776
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,760
uh um this functionality

777
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,720
so uh you know where did all the

778
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,480
millions go

779
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,240
and the other point is still as

780
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,200
mentioned before where are the anonymous

781
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,360
uploads why is

782
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,960
isn't that done properly if it's if it

783
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,760
could be solved or at least

784
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,240
mitigated by some more or less simple

785
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,559
network

786
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,919
configuration and finally where is the

787
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,918
law

788
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,960
again that prohibits any other use of

789
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,640
the data

790
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,600
and finally we would like to close

791
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,440
with the mentioning that this exposure

792
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,080
notification

793
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,279
is can also be seen by attack-based

794
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,320
distraction from those

795
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:10,320
societal problems that lie a lie below

796
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,000
we have too little testing we lack staff

797
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,399
and health agencies in hospitals

798
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,240
we have bad political rules so if people

799
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,799
stick to the rules that are being given

800
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,480
out

801
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,000
then we're still in the catastrophe and

802
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,039
the result right now is

803
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,919
let's say the um the head of our of

804
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,960
uh um the uh robert koch institute just

805
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,799
um

806
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,080
praying to people they should do other

807
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,158
things and i'm just asking

808
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,678
what well if people stick to the rules

809
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,760
and it's still

810
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,279
all going into the catastrophe then the

811
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,440
rules are just bad

812
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,880
um praying shouldn't be part of a

813
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,600
political strategy

814
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,000
um the reporting infrastructure is still

815
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,719
not

816
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,480
fully in place we have a check lack of

817
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,880
checks for quarantined people

818
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,080
after traveling or during quarantine so

819
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,640
all those things

820
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,158
i think have to be kept in mind um

821
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,559
especially when the discussion comes

822
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,320
again

823
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,158
when some people who know nothing about

824
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,918
data protection start screaming that we

825
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,760
should lose in data protection

826
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,279
um first they don't understand anything

827
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,879
about the data protection and second

828
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,399
they obviously don't understand anything

829
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,440
about the problem we're trying to solve

830
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,000
here and the

831
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,200
societal and political background so

832
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,240
this is usually

833
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,640
the point we'd like to close with if you

834
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,559
want

835
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,159
to use technology with your for your

836
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,678
societal problems you have not

837
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,519
understood technology and you have not

838
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,559
understood society

839
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,440
okay thanks a lot and now we're

840
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,840
here for questions and maybe remarks if

841
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,840
you want

842
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,279
some links

843
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,440
yeah first of all thank you very much

844
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,439
kirsten reiner for this talk

845
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,209
yeah i guess the corona app will uh

846
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,120
follow us through the next year

847
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:52,640
[Laughter]

848
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:55,120
will certainly follow me so you think

849
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,960
there'll be major changes made or you

850
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,158
think there's only small adjustments to

851
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,399
be made

852
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,640
what's your yeah what's what's your

853
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,678
guess what's your

854
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,799
wish what's your shout out to the

855
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,880
programmers and the users

856
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,840
um kristen maybe you want to answer

857
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,960
first

858
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,760
well uh i i think it's awfully quiet

859
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,080
around

860
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:22,480
at least the german notification app

861
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,199
i would have supposed that they would

862
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,399
have put

863
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,919
much more uh efforts into

864
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:33,120
making this app a more usable

865
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,640
user more user-friendly uh solving some

866
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,239
of the irritation

867
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:41,440
that pop up uh occasionally

868
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,240
and uh also look into the privacy issues

869
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,799
a bit more

870
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,519
to to gain more trust and to gain more

871
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,519
acceptance

872
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,960
uh how about you reina yeah well i think

873
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,760
i would expect to see only small steps

874
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,720
because um to me it seems that actually

875
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,720
telecom and srp

876
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,639
took the chance and i don't know

877
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,240
if the people who negotiated those deals

878
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,280
if they did not put in

879
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,079
any more developments so i guess

880
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,520
in a normal economic thinking it would

881
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,679
be normal that

882
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,520
telecom and sap now just say well if you

883
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,040
want more functions well you have to

884
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,159
take another contract and we know how

885
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,639
much you need it

886
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,159
so i think we only see small steps i

887
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,399
mean the revolution that has been

888
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,679
rolled out right now is a diary where

889
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,638
you can write down

890
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,720
when you have met someone i don't know

891
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,119
so i think

892
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,839
i think we see small steps but i think

893
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,639
um

894
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,078
there are many good ideas already

895
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,480
floating around

896
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,359
um and i hope to see them there i don't

897
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,520
know maybe you

898
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,199
again we have to rely on the open source

899
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,480
and free software community to maybe to

900
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,078
implement that i don't know maybe there

901
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,280
will be a fork

902
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:56,480
no no idea all right this

903
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,359
there's no questions in the uh in the

904
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,119
chat right now

905
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:04,480
but yeah anything else you want to

906
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:08,720
say to our viewers uh

907
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:10,640
um yeah first uh

908
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,839
everyone should stay as healthy as

909
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,040
possible um

910
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:16,400
i would probably say um when we discuss

911
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,680
about those apps and about those

912
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,880
technical solutions

913
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,319
i think um it's always important to see

914
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,520
that you can

915
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,960
um criticize something without being

916
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,680
totally against it

917
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,440
so um even within our group of the six

918
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,200
uh let's say researchers who built this

919
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,040
data protection impact assessment

920
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,480
we were not we didn't have the same

921
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,880
opinion about all those things

922
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,880
so i can say the app should be much

923
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,119
better and there are major deficits

924
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,560
still going on and i'm still using it so

925
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,960
i think it's not impossible to have

926
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,799
exactly this opinion maybe other people

927
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,079
might criticize it and not use it so i

928
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,760
think it's a

929
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,599
this differentiated approach i think is

930
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,320
very important because many of the

931
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,320
problems

932
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,079
that we're trying to solve right now uh

933
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,680
lis the lacking staff in the health

934
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:04,000
um um um environment or in the in the

935
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,520
health agencies or in the hospitals this

936
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,119
is nothing we can solve within

937
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,440
two months now so maybe the app can be

938
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,160
one

939
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,000
small part and it is possible to be

940
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,520
to say in this emergency moment it might

941
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,359
be an okay idea

942
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,800
and not forgetting that we still have to

943
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,560
do a lot of homework

944
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,160
so this kind of differentiation i think

945
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,920
is at least for me

946
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,399
quite important maine we're from the

947
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,839
dystopian future society

948
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:38,240
so the question is for the next

949
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:39,520
big thing that comes for the next virus

950
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,839
you think this is a good base we're

951
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,079
working on with where we're only little

952
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,759
details like i mean i'm just talking

953
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,000
about the app of course right

954
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,119
master all the rest of the has to

955
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,359
be done

956
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,160
no question about that but maybe the

957
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,279
next virus

958
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,799
works a little different and do we have

959
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,839
an open source

960
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,160
base to to build the app for the for the

961
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:05,359
next plague

962
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,680
well i think we're well equipped now

963
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,560
but i think it's also important to to

964
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,160
see

965
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,599
um i don't know kristin if you want to

966
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,839
say something just

967
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:18,000
just maybe three sentences from me uh

968
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,759
i think it's still not too late to try

969
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,440
to avoid the next plague

970
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:25,280
so maybe we intrude into less areas of

971
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,200
animals which we have not before

972
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,280
always always the best thing to get rid

973
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,399
of exactly not even start them yes

974
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,480
exactly so maybe we treat our resources

975
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,320
more fairly and we treat them like we

976
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,119
need them because we actually do need

977
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,920
them

978
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,520
so i think those big pictures which i

979
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,240
mean right now everyone is in emergency

980
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,640
mode with

981
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,359
thousands of people dying uh but you

982
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,560
know

983
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,720
i think there's quite a connection

984
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,119
between the the climate breakdown global

985
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,959
warning question

986
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,560
and those pandemic things and i think

987
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,640
this is so

988
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,759
um yeah but maybe because you want to

989
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,200
say something as well

990
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,599
to this well i think it's always

991
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,000
important to take a step back and look

992
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,960
at the broader picture

993
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,359
and with with such an app and maybe a

994
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:15,680
next pandemic

995
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:17,839
on the horizon um which we all hope

996
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,279
is not the scenario that we will be

997
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,560
facing um

998
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,839
but is is to to make sure um

999
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,680
that that if if we use our technical

1000
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:30,320
tools for contract tracing

1001
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,200
that then we go away after the pandemic

1002
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,760
that we have

1003
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,439
measures in place to make them actually

1004
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:40,079
go away

1005
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:42,160
and also in the meantime to prepare

1006
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,440
to prepare to have so technical

1007
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,879
solutions

1008
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,520
um in a privacy friendly way

1009
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,000
uh in a way that uh that doesn't

1010
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:55,119
infringe into fundamental rights

1011
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,800
um and that are uh

1012
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:01,839
that that may not be misused uh

1013
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,839
even though maybe if there is a change

1014
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:07,040
in government for example

1015
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:10,240
um so it should be something

1016
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,279
that you you you can maybe the user

1017
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,319
himself can switch off or at least

1018
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,200
cannot be easily

1019
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,640
uh implemented again not updated not be

1020
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,118
mandatory

1021
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,560
uh i think this is this is these are

1022
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,839
quite important uh

1023
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,200
questions and um i think in our talk we

1024
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,240
have mentioned a couple of

1025
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,000
issues of societal issues

1026

future with

1028
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,960
pandemic or without the questions of

1029
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,000

1030
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:45,520
our questions that that

1031
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:49,359

1032
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:52,720
discussed in a in a free or in a society

1033
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:54,880
