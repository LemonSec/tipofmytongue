00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:10,520
[Music]

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,520
[Applause]

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,119
it is

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,320
uh with much pleasure that and i can now

5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,198
introduce our next speaker so it's uh

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,400
just started raining outside but uh this

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,199
heavy rain is

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,400
not at all probably the extreme weather

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,000
effects that we

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,199
will hear about right now um the weather

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,640
uh the the talk

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,120
uh that's uh we are being presented um

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,920
next uh will deal with extreme weather

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,680
effects

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,000
and how they are linked with climate

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,360
change and how we even know about that

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,680
our speaker today is freddie otto

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,440
she's associated director of the

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,879
environmental change institute of the

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,360
university of oxford

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,440
and she's also the lead author of the

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,640
upcoming ipcc

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,920
assessment report ar6 and

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,760
without with no further ado i give you

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,200
the stage ready

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,600
please okay thank you yeah

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,320
hi um it stopped raining here in oxford

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,559
just about

29
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,240
but it's definitely flooded so that

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,520
might actually be something um to come

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,439
back to um

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,200
and talk about with respect to climate

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:26,080
change um

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:29,439
so whenever we hear or whenever

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:33,039
today an extreme weather event happens

36
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:36,158
we hear about hurricanes wildfires

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:40,400
droughts etc the question that

38
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:43,280
is immediately asked is was this

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,920
what is the role of climate change and

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,159
uh

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,360
to answer that for quite a long time

42
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,240
scientists gave an answer um

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,360
that we cannot attribute individual

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,500
weather events

45
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,000
to climate change but um

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,119
[Music]

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,119
sorry okay

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,720
but this because the first the one

49
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,080
answer that people were giving

50
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,080
uh were that well

51
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,319
you can't attribute individual weather

52
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,280
events or they were saying

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,560
in uh yeah in a world where climate

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,560
change happens of course

55
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,239
every extreme weather event is somewhat

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,480
affected by climate change

57
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,760
and the latter is tributed to but that

58
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,720
does not

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,200
obviously provide much information

60
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,120
because

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,040
it doesn't say anything about whether

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,000
the event was made more likely or less

63
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,040
likely or

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,160
or what the role of climate change was

65
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,599
and the first uh answer that you can't

66
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,040
attribute individual events

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,760
is not true any longer and

68
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,239
this is and and why that has changed and

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,040
how that has changed uh and what we can

70
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,840
say

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,879
is uh what the content of this talk will

72
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,319
be

73
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:03,359
so ultimately every

74
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,599
weathervan extreme or not is

75
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,720
if you absolutely boil down to it is

76
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,319
unique

77
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,359
and they all have many different causes

78
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,079
so there is always a role of um

79
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,599
just the natural chaotic variability of

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,680
the climate system and climate and

81
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,119
weather system that plays a role

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,159
it there's always um a causal factor in

83
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,440
whether the um where the event happens

84
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,840
whether it's over land

85
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,480
over um over a desert over city over

86
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,000
forest

87
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:39,679
but also man-made climate change

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,200
can have an influence on the likelihood

89
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,319
and intensity of

90
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,440
extreme weather events to occur and so

91
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,640
what we can say now and what we mean

92
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,040
when we talk about

93
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,079
attribution of extreme weather events to

94
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,679
climate change

95
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,959
is how the magnitude

96
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,680
and likelihood of an event to occur

97
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,799
has changed because of man-made climate

98
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,400
change

99
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:12,640
and in order to do that we first of all

100
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:16,079
need to know what is possible weather

101
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,358
in the world we live in today so

102
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,519
say we have a flooding event in oxford

103
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,080
and the question is well is this climate

104
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,199
change or not so the first question is

105
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,719
um we need to find out what type

106
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,000
or what kind of event is um the rate the

107
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,560
heavy rainfall event

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,320
that leads to the flooding so is it a

109
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,919
one and ten year event is it a one in a

110
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,479
hundred year event

111
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,599
um and in order to do that you can't

112
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,599
just look at

113
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,880
the observed weather records because

114
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,479
that will tell you

115
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,840
what the actual weather that occurred is

116
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,000
but it doesn't tell you what the

117
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,719
possible weather under the same

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
current climate conditions are and so we

119
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,120
need to find out what

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,919
is possible weather and to do that we

121
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,960
use

122
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,960
different climate models so we simulate

123
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,799
under this the same climate conditions

124
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,320
that we have today

125
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,199
possible rainfall events in december in

126
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,240
uh in oxford and we might find out that

127
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,919
the event that

128
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,440
we have observed today is a one and ten

129
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,479
year event

130
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,479
and so if you then um if you do this

131
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,719
look at all the possible weather events

132
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,639
you get a distribution of possible

133
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,039
weather under certain conditions which

134
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,120
is

135
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,320
uh shown in the schematic on the slide

136
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,680
here in this

137
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,880
in in the red curve and then you know

138
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,080
that when it rains above say 30

139
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,479
millimeters a day

140
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,520
in oxford then you have a real problem

141
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,120
with flooding

142
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,198
so you define that this is your

143
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,440
threshold from when you speak about an

144
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,560
extreme event and so you have

145
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:56,479
a probability of this event to

146
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,960
occur in the world we live in today

147
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,479
of course that does not tell you um the

148
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,799
role of climate change

149
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,199
because in order to know that you would

150
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,680
also you will also need to know

151
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,240
what would the likelihood of this event

152
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,880
to occur

153
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,000
have been without man-made climate

154
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,919
change

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,360
and so but because we know very well

156
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,159
how many greenhouse gases have been

157
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,280
introduced in to the atmosphere since

158
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,400
the beginning of the industrial

159
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,840
revolution

160
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,520
we can actually remove these additional

161
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,638
greenhouse gases

162
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,440
from the climate models atmospheres that

163
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,280
we use

164
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,479
and simulate a world that would have

165
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,440
been exactly

166
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,039
as it is today but without the

167
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,080
greenhouse gases

168
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,599
from the burning of fossil fuels and in

169
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,479
that world we can then

170
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,120
also ask the question what's what are

171
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,919
possible

172
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,960
heavy rainfall events in december in

173
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,240
oxford

174
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,280
and we might find that the event um that

175
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,319
we are interested in

176
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,479
is in that world not a one and ten year

177
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,840
event but a one 120-year event

178
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,560
and because everything else is held the

179
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,960
same

180
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,720
we can then attribute the difference

181
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,680
between these two

182
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,560
likelihoods of occurrence of the extreme

183
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,319
event

184
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,800
in question um to man-made climate

185
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,840
change

186
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,560
and so with this fake example that i've

187
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,840
just

188
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,639
used we would then say climate change

189
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,000
has doubled the likelihood of the event

190
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,240
to occur because one

191
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,720
that was a one and twenty year event is

192
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,400
now one in ten years

193
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:42,560
so that is basically

194
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,039
the whole theoretical idea behind

195
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,599
attributing extreme events and this

196
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,560
method can be used and so for example

197
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,878
with our um initiative that's called

198
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,160
world weather attribution we have looked

199
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,720
this year at the extreme heat

200
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,360
in uh in siberia at the beginning of

201
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,960
this

202
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,680
year that uh amongst other

203
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,000
things led to temperatures above 38

204
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,639
degrees in the city of virgins

205
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,120
but also led to permafrost throwing and

206
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,479
large

207
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,919
wildfires and that event uh

208
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,960
was made so much more likely

209
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,198
because of climate change um that it's

210
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,479
it's almost would have been impossible

211
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,960
without climate change

212
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,120
so when we did the experiments and the

213
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,478
you the models it's a

214
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,000
180 million year event in a world

215
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,760
without climate change

216
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,279
and it's still a relatively extreme

217
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,000
event in today's world

218
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,679
but it is possible so this is the type

219
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,279
of event where climate change

220
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:48,319
really is a game changer another event

221
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:51,760
um that that we have looked at um

222
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:55,440
is hurricane harvey that hits

223
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:59,200
the houston and texas in 2017

224
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:03,279
and caused huge amounts of damage with

225
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:06,000
the rainfall amounts it brought and

226
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,080
several attribution studies doing

227
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,600
exactly what i've just described

228
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,080
found that this type of so this

229
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,600
extreme rainfall associated with the

230
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,160
hurricane like harvey

231
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,160
has been made three times more likely

232
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,880
because of climate change

233
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,519
and colleagues of mine dave frame and

234
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,800
his team

235
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,440
have then used this studies um

236
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,399
to figure out how much of the economic

237
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,120
costs

238
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,160
with this hurricane can be attributed to

239
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,399
climate change

240
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,880
and found that of the 90 billion us

241
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,000
dollars that were associated

242
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:46,320
um that that were associated with

243
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,360
the flood damage from harvard 67 billion

244
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,839
can be attributed to climate change

245
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,880
which is in particular interesting when

246
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,399
you compare that

247
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,200
to the state-of-the-art

248
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,560
economic cost estimations of climate

249
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,000
change in general

250
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,000
which had uh own had estimated only 20

251
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,560
billion us dollars for 2020 uh for 2017

252
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,120
in the us from climate change and of

253
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,439
course

254
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,519
not every year is an event like harvey

255
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,360
but it shows that when you look

256
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,200
at um at the impact of climate change in

257
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,680
a more bottom-up approach so

258
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,959
looking at the extreme events which are

259
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,000
how climate change

260
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,719
manifests and affect people you get very

261
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,760
different

262
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,880
uh numbers as if you just look at scale

263
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,200
changes in in temperature and

264
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,720
precipitation

265
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:44,000
but of course not every extreme event

266
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,320
that occurs today has been made worse

267
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,360
because of climate change so this is an

268
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,320
example of

269
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,680
um a drought in southeast brazil that

270
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,720
happened in 2014 2015

271
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:00,079
where we found that climate change

272
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,519
did not uh change the likelihood of this

273
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,560
drought to occur

274
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:08,320
so it was a one and ten year event

275
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,040
in 2014 2015 and also without climate

276
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,079
change

277
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,120
it has this very similar likelihood of

278
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,040
occurrence however what we did find when

279
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,320
we looked at okay what else has changed

280
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,120
why has this drought

281
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,320
that has um occurred in a very similar

282
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,440
way earlier in the

283
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,959
2000s and also

284
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,440
in the 1970s with much less impacts

285
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,319
we looked at other factors and found

286
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,640
that the population has increased

287
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,399
a lot over the last or over the

288
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,760
beginning of the 21st century

289
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,160
but in particular the water consumption

290
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,040
uh

291
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,800
in in the area and the water usage has

292
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,120
increased almost exponentially

293
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,680
and that explained why the impacts were

294
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,680
so large

295
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,638
so this is um what i've just said is

296
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,839
sort of basically

297
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:03,120
the the very basic idea and and and

298
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:07,600
uh how in theory these studies work and

299
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:11,360
and how uh and some results that we find

300
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,200
in practice um it is usually

301
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,200
not quite as straightforward because

302
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,320
well the idea is is still the same we

303
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,040
need to

304
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,839
use climate models and statistical

305
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,719
models

306
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,800
for observational data to simulate

307
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,320
possible weather in the world we live in

308
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,639
and possible whether in the world that

309
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,480
might have been

310
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,440
that is in theory straightforward and

311
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,639
practice it's often relatively difficult

312
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,160
and what you see here is how the results

313
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,440
of these studies

314
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,360
look when you don't use schematic and if

315
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,040
you're not a hydrologist this might be a

316
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,040
bit of an unfriendly

317
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:52,079
uh plot but it's it's basically the same

318
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:55,599
as the schematic that i've showed in

319
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,319
at the beginning but just uh plotted in

320
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,680
a way

321
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,480
that you can see the tails of the

322
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,120
distribution

323
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,000
particularly well so where the extreme

324
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
events are

325
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,760
so on the x-axis we have the return time

326
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,720
of the event in years on a logarithmic

327
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,839
scale

328
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,560
and on the y-axis you see um the

329
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,760
magnitude

330
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,599
of the event um and and

331
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,800
that defines um what what our extreme

332
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,320
event is and this is

333
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:30,880
actually a real example uh from

334
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:33,920
uh heavy rainfall in the south of the uk

335
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:37,279
and you can see here in red

336
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,680
each of these red dots

337
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,639
that that you see on the red curve is a

338
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,760
simulation of

339
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:47,279
one possible rainfall event

340
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,279
in the south of the uk in the year 2015

341
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,279
in the world we live in today with

342
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,320
climate change and the dashed line

343
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:58,399
indicates um the threshold

344
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:01,440
that led to um that led to flooding in

345
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,240
in that year and

346
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,000
on the x-axis when you go down from the

347
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,399
dashed line you can then see that this

348
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,839
is roughly a one in 20-year event

349
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,240
um in the world we live in today

350
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,160
and all the blue dots on the blue curve

351
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,120
are simulations of possible heavy

352
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,120
rainfall

353
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,199
in the south of the uk in 2015

354
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,199
in a world without man-made climate

355
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,240
change and you can see

356
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,000
that these two curves are different and

357
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,399
significantly different

358
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
but they are still relatively close

359
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,920
together and so the event

360
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,480
in the world without climate change

361
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,519
would have been uh a bit less likely

362
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,560
so we have roughly 40 increase in the

363
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,920
likelihood

364
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,800
but still um other factors

365
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,760
like um yeah just the chaotic

366
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,240
variability

367
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,000
of the weather and also of course then

368
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,240
other factors on the ground

369
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,199
where our houses build and flood plains

370
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,240
and so on

371
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,240
play an important role so

372
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,560
this is this is the actual attribution

373
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,479
step so when we find out what the role

374
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,880
of climate change is

375
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,320
but of course in order to do that there

376
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,760
are few steps

377
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:22,240
before that are crucially important

378
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:25,120
and absolutely determine the outcome

379
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,320
and the first step the first thing to

380
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,079
find out is

381
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,360
what has actually happened because

382
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,040
usually

383
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,959
when we read about extreme weather

384
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,880
events or when we hear about extreme

385
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,599
weather events

386
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,639
you see pictures and newspapers of

387
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,240
flooded

388
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:45,440
parts of the world um and so

389
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,000
you don't usually have um observed

390
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,120
weather recordings reported in the media

391
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,839
and the same actually is is true for us

392
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,040
so when we are um so we work a lot with

393
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,160
red cross

394
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,719
and uh they ask us okay we have

395
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,839
um this large flooding event can you do

396
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,680
an attribution

397
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,199
study can you tell us what the role of

398
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,519
climate change is

399
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,519
then we also just know okay there is

400
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,199
flooding and so the first step is

401
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,800
we need to find out what is the weather

402
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,479
event that actually caused

403
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,479
that flooding and that is not always

404
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,279
that straightforward and this is what

405
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,839
you see here on on this map

406
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:29,040
on this slide isn't a relatively sharp

407
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,800
example but not an untypical so

408
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,880
it's of an extreme rainfall event on the

409
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,680
10th of november 2018

410
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,399
in kenya and on the left hand side is

411
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,199
one

412
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,040
data product of observational data of

413
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,839
observational rainfall data that is

414
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,680
available

415
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,360
and on the right hand side is another

416
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,638
project showing this is

417
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:52,880
the same event and the

418
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:55,279
yeah the scale which i've failed um

419
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,959
to sell say on the slide is in

420
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,600
millimeters per day

421
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,160
um and so on the left hand side you have

422
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,800
uh

423
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,519
extreme rainfall of above 50 millimeters

424
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,799
per day

425
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:10,480
which is considering that for example in

426
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:13,520
uh in my hometown town of kiel and

427
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,799
holstein um there is about 700

428
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,760
millimeters

429
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,280
of rainfall per year you can see that 50

430
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,400
millimeter in a single day

431
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,959
is very heavy rainfall whereas in the

432
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,880
other

433
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,919
um data product you don't see

434
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,640
um as much rain you still see large rain

435
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,240
but it's

436
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,160
not quite not in the same magnitude

437
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,360
and it's also not exactly in the same

438
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,760
place and so

439
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,678
given that most countries in the world

440
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,280
do not have an open data policy

441
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:50,000
so you can't actually get access to

442
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,879
the observed station data but you have

443
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,440
to use

444
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,440
available publicly available products

445
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,240
like that you have shown here

446
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,640
you have to know and you have to work

447
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,000
with

448
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,120
experts in in the region to actually

449
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,600
know

450
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,039
who hopefully have access to the data to

451
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,320
actually find out what has happened in

452
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,480
the first place

453
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,918
but of course if you don't know that or

454
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,840
there is not always

455
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,840
a perfect answer

456
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,960
it's very difficult to do an attribution

457
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,080
study

458
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,280
assuming though you have found um a data

459
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,639
product that you trust

460
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,678
um the next question then is

461
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,960
what is actually the right threshold to

462
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,360
use for the event

463
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,640
so if it's if you have flooding that was

464
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,719
pretty obviously

465
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,400
caused by a one day extreme rainfall

466
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,400
event then that would be

467
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,640
your definition of the event but it

468
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,080
could also be that the flooding has been

469
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,360
caused by

470
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,918
um a very soggy rainy season so

471
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,439
actually the the really the real event

472
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,320
you would want to look at is

473
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,360
a much over a much longer time scale or

474
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,520
if

475
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,159
the flooding occurred mainly because of

476
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,879
some water management in the rivers and

477
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,160
has actually

478
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,320
flooded further upstream your spatial

479
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,200
definition of the event would be very

480
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,360
different

481
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,400
and so and what you see here on this

482
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,080
plot is

483
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:19,280
um an example of a heat wave in

484
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,760
in europe in 2019 and there

485
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,520
what usually makes the headlines is the

486
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,240
maximum daily temperature

487
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,200
so the if records are broken so you

488
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,600
could use that

489
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,880
as a definition of the event that you're

490
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,918
interested in

491
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,200
but of course what really causes the the

492
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,240
losses and damages

493
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,880
from extreme events is not necessarily

494
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,880
the one day maximum temperature but it

495
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,080
is when heatwaves last for longer

496
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,240
and especially when the night

497
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,918
temperatures are also high in not just

498
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,600
the daytime temperatures

499
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,760
so you might want to look at an event

500
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,719
over five day period instead of just

501
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,919
maximum

502
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,480
daily temperatures or and this is sort

503
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,240
of

504
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,840
why i've shown the um the pressure plot

505
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,559
on on the right hand side which is

506
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,399
really just

507
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,918
an illustration it's not terribly

508
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,760
important what's on there

509
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,120
but there are of course different

510
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,559
weather systems

511
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,879
that can cause uh heat waves especially

512
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,120
in

513
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,320
in the area here in the south of france

514
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,918
it could be

515
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:25,520
a relatively short-lived um

516
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:27,760
high pressure system bringing bringing

517
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,000
hot air from the mediterranean or it

518
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,280
could be something that is caused from

519
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,919
a long time stationary high pressure

520
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,240
system overhaul of europe

521
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,679
you if you want to take that into

522
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,799
account obviously also

523
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,240
your event is different and there is no

524
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,520
right or wrong

525
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,679
way to define the event because

526
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,879
there are legitimate interests in the

527
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,039
maximum one

528
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,640
daily temperatures legitimate interest

529
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,840
in just a specific

530
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:01,840
type of of pressure system

531
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,399
and interest in what actually causes

532
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,799
more

533
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,320
excess mortality on people would be the

534
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,918
three day or longer

535
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:13,039
type of heat waves but whichever

536
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:16,799
definition you choose it will determine

537
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:20,559
the outcome of the study

538
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:23,600
and here are some typical results

539
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:27,360
of attribution studies

540
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,559
when you look at them in a slightly more

541
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,399
scientific way and slightly less just

542
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,918
the hat line ways the ones that i've

543
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,640
shown earlier

544
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,240
because of course what also is important

545
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,280
is not only how you define the

546
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,799
um the event depending on the impacts

547
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,039
and depending on what what you're

548
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,879
interested in the extreme event

549
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,879
and what observational data you have

550
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,919
available but of course there's also

551
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,480
then the question of

552
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,559
what models what climate models do we

553
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,799
have available and there's always

554
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,480
some trade-off between what exactly

555
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,679
caused the event and what we can

556
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,720
meaningfully

557
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,559
simulate in a climate model

558
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,559
and then all climate models are good for

559
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,760
something and bad for other things

560
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,559
so there always need to be um a model

561
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,879
evaluation

562
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,240
stage so where you test if the models

563
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,320
that you have available

564
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,440
are actually able to stimulate in a

565
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,918
reliable way

566
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,039
the event that you're interested in but

567
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,760
even if you have done all this

568
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,760
it can sometimes be that the models and

569
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,760
the observations that you have

570
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,360
show very different things and so the

571
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,640
heat wave in germany

572
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,039
uh in 2019 which was on

573
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,400
uh which was also on the slide before is

574
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,280
an example of that

575
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,400
where we when we look at the long-term

576
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:47,360
observations

577
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:50,480
of of extreme of high temperatures

578
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,600
and see how they have changed over time

579
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,919
we find that because of

580
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,918
the change in climate we have observed

581
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,240
the likelihood of this type of heat wave

582
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,600
has

583
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,720
increased um more

584
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,360
yeah about 300 times so what you see on

585
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,720
the

586
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,280
you see this in the blue the black bar

587
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,000
the black bar in the middle of the blue

588
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,918
bar

589
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,600
on the left hand side at the very top

590
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,520
where it says dwd

591
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,199
ups that's the deutsche batter dean's

592
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,158
observations and we see

593
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,600
that where this black bar is about again

594
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,559
a logarithmic scale about

595
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,320
300 times more likely but of course

596
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:32,879
because we have only

597
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:35,918
um only 100 years worth of observations

598
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,120
and that and summer temperatures are

599
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,000
extremely variable

600
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,559
there's a large uncertainty around this

601
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,720
change

602
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,000
and so we cannot from the observations

603
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,279
alone we cannot

604
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,200
exclude uh a 100 000 times

605
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,919
change in the likelihood of this heat

606
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,520
wave but similarly also not a 20 times

607
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,760
heat wave

608
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,960
but what the main point is that in all

609
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,840
the climate models

610
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,400
and all the red bars that you see on

611
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,439
there

612
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,159
are the same results but for

613
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,520
climate models so where we have compared

614
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,919
today's likelihood

615
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,918
of the event to occur with the

616
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,559
likelihood in the world without climate

617
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,400
change

618
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,678
and you see that the change is much

619
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,840
lower

620
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,720
and of course climate change is not the

621
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,120
only thing

622
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,960
that has changed and that has affected

623
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,600
observed temperatures

624
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,240
but other factors like land use change

625
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,158
and

626
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,919
and and things like that are much

627
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,320
smaller in

628
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,760
in the size than the climate signal so

629
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,799
they cannot explain

630
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,799
this discrepancy so this means that

631
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,520
the climate ones we have available for

632
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:44,240
this type of study

633
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,679
have obviously a problem with the

634
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,880
extreme temperatures

635
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,679
in on a small scale

636
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,640
and there are effects that we don't get

637
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,039
understand

638
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,039
and so we can't say okay this heat wave

639
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:00,240
was made ten times more likely

640
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:03,120
but we can only say um that with

641
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,880
our current knowledge and understanding

642
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,879
we can say that climate change

643
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,880
was an absolute game changer for this

644
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,600
type of heatwave but we can't really

645
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,600
quantify it

646
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,199
on the right hand side is a much nicer

647
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,600
result

648
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,559
on the top one which is for extreme

649
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,760
rainfall and ticks

650
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,320
in texas 2019 and nicer result i mean

651
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,200
now for

652
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,678
scientists so in in a scientific way so

653
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,200
there

654
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:32,720
we have in blue two different types

655
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,200
of um of observations

656
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,600
from the heavy rainfall event and they

657
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,520
both show pretty much exactly the same

658
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:43,039
result

659
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,760
and also the two climate models

660
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,760
that we had available that passed the

661
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,799
model evaluation tests

662
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,039
show an increase

663
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,879
in the likelihood of this event to occur

664
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,440
that is very similar to that

665
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,480
in the observations in terms of order of

666
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,240
magnitude

667
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:05,200
and so in that case we can

668
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,400
just synthesize the results and give an

669
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,120
overall arching

670
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,320
answer which is that the likelihood of

671
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,879
this event to occur

672
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,039
has about doubled because of man-made

673
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,320
climate change

674
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:21,600
and the last example um that

675
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:25,918
i that is here is for drought and

676
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:28,719
drought in somalia in 2010 where

677
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,760
not only the observations are extremely

678
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,480
uncertain

679
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,120
so from the observations you could say

680
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,440
we could

681
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,959
have both an increase in likelihood or

682
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:42,159
decrease in likelihood by a factor 10

683
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,880
but also the climate models show

684
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,559
a very um a very mixed picture where you

685
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,600
can't even

686
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,039
see a sign that that is conclusive so in

687
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,799
that case you can say

688
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:57,760
well we can exclude that climate change

689
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,960
made this event more or less than 10

690
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,960
times

691
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,240
yeah more than 10 times or less than 10

692
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,600
times more likely

693
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,600
but we can't say anything more so

694
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,360
we can exclude that it's a complete game

695
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,199
changer like we have for heat waves for

696
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,600
example but that's about the only

697
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,400
the only thing that you can say in for a

698
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,399
result like this

699
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:23,600
so this was sort of the

700
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,480
the most the detailed scientific stuff

701
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,719
that i would like

702
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,520
to show because i think it's important

703
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,640
um

704
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,158
to get some background uh behind the the

705
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,640
headline results that

706
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,960
that would just be climate change double

707
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,679
the likelihood of this event

708
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,480
so there are always four possible

709
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,159
outcomes

710
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:47,600
of an attribution study at priori

711
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,640
and that is because

712
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,360
because climate change affects extreme

713
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,559
weather

714
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,039
in two ways basically one way

715
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,600
is what we would call the thermodynamic

716
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,679
way

717
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,439
um which means that because we have more

718
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,919
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere

719
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,559
the atmosphere overall gets warmer so

720
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,960
you have

721
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,879
on average an increase in the likelihood

722
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,799
of heat waves a decrease in the

723
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,880
likelihood of cold waves

724
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,918
a warmer atmosphere can also hold more

725
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,000
water vapor

726
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,279
that means that needs to get out of the

727
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,080
atmosphere as rainfall

728
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,440
so on average from the warming alone we

729
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,320
would also have

730
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,440
um more extreme rainfall but then there

731
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,600
is a second effect

732
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,279
which i call the dynamic effect and that

733
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,320
is because we've changed

734
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:35,039
the composition of the atmosphere that

735
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,039
affects the atmospheric circulation so

736
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,158
where weather systems develop how they

737
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,559
develop and

738
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,320
and how they move and this effect can

739
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:46,960
either be in the same direction

740
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,960
as the warming effect so it can be that

741
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,399
well we have expect more extreme

742
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,799
rainfall but we also get

743
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,320
more low pressure systems bring rain so

744
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:57,279
you get even more extreme

745
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,000
rainfall but these two effects can also

746
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,200
counteract

747
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
each other and so if you if you ex

748
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,919
you can expect more rainfall on average

749
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,120
but if you don't get the weather systems

750
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,760
that bring rain

751
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,639
you either have no change in likelihood

752
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,360
and intensity

753
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,559
or if the dynamics win you have actually

754
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,559
decrease

755
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,760
in the likelihood of extreme rainfall in

756
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,760
a particular season

757
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,919
or region and so this is why our priori

758
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,158
that can always be for our camps it can

759
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,399
be that the event was made more likely

760
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,320
it can be that it was made less likely

761
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,000
it can be there's no change

762
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,600
or it can be that with our current

763
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,000
understanding and tools

764
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:43,520
we can't actually answer the question

765
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,919
and so um this has been possible to do

766
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,639
um now for for about a decade

767
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,240
um but only in the last five years

768
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,640
really have many many

769
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,760
people or many scientists started to do

770
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,880
these studies and so

771
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:02,799
there is actually a relatively um

772
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,960
large um yeah there are

773
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,480
there are lots of attribution studies on

774
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,240
different kind of extreme events and

775
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,440
what you can see on this map here

776
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,000
is uh what the

777
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,480
news and energy outlet carbon brief has

778
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,960
put

779
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,000
uh all these studies together and you

780
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,080
can see in red

781
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,320
where climate change made they've played

782
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,320
an important role in blue where climate

783
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,080
change did not play a role

784
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:31,520
and in grey that was an inclusive

785
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,520
inconclusive result

786
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,159
this is very important though that this

787
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,520
is not

788
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,399
representative of the extreme events

789
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,559
that have

790
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,479
happened this is just represents the

791
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:47,530
studies that have been done

792
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,720
by scientists and um

793
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:52,960
[Music]

794
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:56,720
and they have um and they are of course

795
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,919
um bias towards

796
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,720
where uh scientists live and also

797
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,519
towards

798
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,480
extreme events that are relatively easy

799
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,760
to simulate

800
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,039
with climate models so um there are lots

801
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,720
of heat waves

802
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:15,840
in europe australia and north america

803
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,440
because that is where people live

804
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:22,959
and on this next map i have tried to put

805
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,640
um to to show the discrepancy

806
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,159
between the extreme events that have

807
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,799
happened and those

808
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,240
for which we actually do know the role

809
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,360
of climate change

810
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,200
so here um in red our

811
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,559
death associated with extreme events

812
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,200
since 2003

813
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,639
so since the first event attribution

814
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,720
study

815
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:48,240
and um it's it's death from

816
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,760
heat waves storms heavy rainfall events

817
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,360
and droughts

818
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,039
primarily in different parts of the

819
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,678
world the bubble is always

820
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:57,440
on the capital of the country and the

821
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,039
larger the bubble the more death

822
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:04,080
due to extreme events in those years

823
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:07,440
and in black overlaying that are

824
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,199
those deaths for which we know the role

825
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,120
of climate change so that doesn't mean

826
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,480
that they're at the death are attributed

827
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,120
to climate change

828
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,080
but it means that they are there we do

829
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,678
know

830
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,360
whether or not and to what extent

831
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,559
climate change played a role

832
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:25,439
and you can see that in most of the

833
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,279
european countries the black circle is

834
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,279
almost as large as the red one

835
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,360
so for most of the extremes of most of

836
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,919
the death associated with extreme events

837
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:37,360
we do know the role of climate change

838
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:39,679
but for the um but for the

839
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,559
for many other parts of the world there

840
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,399
are no or very small black circles so

841
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,840
for most of the events and the death

842
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,678
associated with them

843
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,918
we don't know what the role of climate

844
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,080
change is and i've used death here not

845
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,279
because i'm particularly morbid

846
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,600
but because it's um it's an indicator of

847
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,679
the

848
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,840
impacts of extreme weather that is

849
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,720
relatively good comparable between

850
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,840
countries

851
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,640
so this means that with

852
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,879
event attribution methods that we have

853
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,799
developed over the last decade

854
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:16,159
we now have the tools available to do

855
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,760
to provide an inventory of the impacts

856
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,640
of climate change

857
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,720
on our livelihoods but we are very far

858
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,679
from having such an inventory

859
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,039
at the moment um because most of the

860
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,279
events that have happened

861
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,840
we actually don't know what the role of

862
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:35,440
climate change is and so we don't know

863
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,918
in um in in detail on country

864
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,679
and uh scale and on the scale where

865
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:45,039
people live and make decisions

866
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:45,039
what the role of climate change is today

867
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:54,559
there's another slightly related

868
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:57,039
uh issue with that is that the

869
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:59,039
extreme events that i've used to create

870
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,640
the map i've shown before with the death

871
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,640
of climate change

872
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,760
um with the death of of extreme weather

873
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,279
events they are from

874
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,750
a database called emdat which is a

875
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,280
publicly available database where

876
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:14,480
[Music]

877
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,599
losses and damages associated with

878
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,000
disasters technological disasters but

879
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,480
also

880
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,560
disasters associated with weather are

881
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,760
recorded

882
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,880
but of course they only

883
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,280
can record

884
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,359
[Music]

885
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,919
losses and damages if these losses and

886
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,839
damages are recorded in the first place

887
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,719
and so what you see on this map

888
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,159
is in gray and then overlay with

889
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,678
different

890
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,839
uh with different circles are um

891
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,879
heat waves that have occurred they have

892
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,839
occurred between 1986 and 2015 on this

893
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:53,359
map but

894
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:55,279
you could draw a map from 1900 to today

895
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,839
and it would look very similar

896
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,680
and that shows lots and lots of heatwave

897
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,960
reported in europe in

898
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,520
in the us india but

899
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,079
there are no heat waves reported in most

900
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,079
of sub-saharan africa

901
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,599
however when you look at observations

902
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,280
and also

903
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:18,400
we see that extreme heat has increased

904
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,320
quite dramatically in most parts of the

905
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,599
world and a particular hotspot

906
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,160
is sub-saharan africa so

907
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,320
we know from when we look at the weather

908
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,960
that heat waves are happening

909
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,119
but it's not registered and it's not

910
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,000
recorded so we have no idea how many

911
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,560
people

912
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,599
um are actually affected by these heat

913
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,720
waves and so

914
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,680
we then of course don't do attribution

915
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,000
studies and don't

916
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,919
find out what the role of climate change

917
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,200
in these heat waves is

918
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,680
so in order to to really understand

919
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,720
the whole picture we would also need to

920
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,919
start

921
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:59,839
recording these type of events uh

922
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,839
in in other parts of the world

923
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,640
and so my very last point um before i

924
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,839
hope that

925
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:11,279
that you have questions for me is um

926
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:13,680
of course everything i've said so far

927
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,160
was talking about the hazards so talking

928
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,640
about the weather event and how climate

929
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,598
change

930
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,078
affects the hazard but of course that is

931
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,040
not

932
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,720
the same or translates immediately into

933
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,520
losses and damages

934
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,160
because whether or not a weather event

935
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,040
actually has

936
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,240
any impacts at all is large it's

937
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,960
completely driven by

938
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,359
exposure and vulnerability so who and

939
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,560
what

940
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:41,200
is in harm's way and i've already shown

941
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,160
um i've already mentioned the example

942
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,919
early on

943
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:49,118
with the the drought in brazil where

944
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,280
the huge losses and damages were to

945
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,800
large degree attributable to the

946
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,839
increase in

947
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:59,119
water consumption and uh

948
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:01,920
and and that's therefore um

949
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,760
in order to really find out how climate

950
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,040
change is affecting us today

951
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,640
we not only um need to define the

952
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,680
extreme events so that it

953
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,839
that it connects to the impacts but

954
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,839
also look into vulnerability and

955
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:18,560
exposure what is changing

956
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,279
what their and what what are the

957
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,400
important

958
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:25,760
factors but we can do that

959
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,720
and so we have really made a lot of

960
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,040
progress

961
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,799
in understanding of how climate change

962
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,759
not only affects

963
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,320
um global meat temperature which we have

964
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:39,040
known

965
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:41,680
for centuries and and how it affects um

966
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,520
large-scale changes in temperature and

967
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,118
precipitation which we have also known

968
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,839
for a very long time

969
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,760
but we now are have actually all the

970
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,960
puzzle pieces together to really

971
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,920
understand

972
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,200
what climate change means on the scale

973
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,920
where people live

974
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,399
and where decisions are made we just

975
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,160
need

976
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:06,000
to put them together and

977
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:09,759
one lens or one way of where they are

978
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,800
currently put together is for example in

979
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,760
courts um and so

980
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,119
because it's obviously people who

981
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,880
experience losses

982
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:24,720
and damages from climate change and so

983
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,520
one way to address that is going through

984
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,839
national governments local governments

985
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,880
hoping for adaptation measures

986
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:34,560
to be put in place but if that's not

987
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,280
forthcoming quickly enough

988
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,720
there is the option to sue and so this

989
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,200
is one example

990
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,480
which is currently happening in germany

991
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:47,200
where a proven

992
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:50,560
farmer is suing rwe

993
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:53,680
to to base to basically pay

994
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:56,799
their share of um a

995
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,240
adaptation because of a largely

996
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,730
increased flood risk

997
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,879
from glacier melt in the area and

998
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:06,000
[Music]

999
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,240
they want rwe to pay

1000
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,200
from their contribution to climate

1001
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:14,078
change via their emissions

1002
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,279
and then have some funding for the

1003
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,440
adaptation measures

1004
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,560
from them and that is one example of

1005
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,040
where

1006
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,400
these kind of attribution studies can be

1007
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,960
used in a very direct

1008
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,839
way um to to hopefully change something

1009
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,880
in the real world and with this i would

1010
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:34,078
like to end

1011
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,720
um and yeah leave you with

1012
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:43,839
some references and hope you have some

1013
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,839
questions for me

1014
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,839
so

1015
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,839
here

1016
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:50,629
[Music]

1017
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,949
[Music]

1018
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:13,440
[Music]

1019
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,839
um

1020
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:33,829
[Music]

1021
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,200
sorry to interrupt i just realized that

1022
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:46,799
we are still in english

1023
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:50,160
talk okay sorry no words

1024
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,560
um so your question was if there um

1025
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,240
if if uh we're going to see more

1026
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,599
international court cases

1027
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,399
where across countries across nation

1028
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,240
states

1029
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,160
um we we have climate litigation and

1030
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,598
this type of litigation that that i've

1031
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,799
just shown as the example

1032
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,839
is is and so far an exception as uh in

1033
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,640
german law

1034
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,839
a company is also responsible for the

1035
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,319
damages caused

1036
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,839
outside of germany which is not the case

1037
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:21,279
for example for companies

1038
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:25,920
in in the us um or or so

1039
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:29,200
so um and this is why um luya sued rwe

1040
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:32,720
and not for example exxonmobil but

1041
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:37,200
um these these type of cases

1042
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:40,799
um where this this luya cases an example

1043
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,118
uh are um we see a lot of

1044
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,800
a lot of them an increasing number of

1045
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:49,839
them each year

1046
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:53,920
and they are difficult to do across

1047
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:57,359
nations because this the german law is

1048
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,680
exception in that case but

1049
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,440
there are other ways um like for example

1050
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,960
by human rights courts

1051
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:08,319
that that can be done across uh

1052
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:11,200
nation states and that that is also

1053
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:12,800
happening so it's at the moment it's

1054
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,319
still legally

1055
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,760
not super straightforward to to actually

1056
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:20,400
win these cases

1057
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,520
but increasingly a lot of lawyers

1058
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,640
working on that

1059
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,240
um so that we will see a lot of change

1060
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,240
in that

1061
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,399
in the coming years okay thank you

1062
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,399
in the meantime there appeared some

1063
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,079
questions from from the chat and from

1064
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,720
the internet i will go through them

1065
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,880
first question is are the results of the

1066
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,640
individual attribution studies published

1067
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,119
as open data in a machine readable

1068
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,118
format

1069
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:54,480
so all the studies that that we do um

1070
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,079
that that i've done with my team with

1071
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,920
world weather attribution

1072
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:02,960
um so there all the all the data is

1073
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,640
is available uh and it's available on

1074
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,640
a platform that's called climate

1075
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:10,240
explorer um

1076
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,720
so that should be machine readable um so

1077
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,839
and and

1078
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:16,959
this is deliberately because um

1079
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:19,359
yeah because we we want to make it as

1080
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,440
transparent as possible so everyone can

1081
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,200
go away use our data and redo our

1082
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,520
studies and

1083
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,118
find out if we've made any mistakes but

1084
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,720
this is not the case for

1085
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:33,040
all the studies that exist because

1086
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,720
a lot most of them or many of them are

1087
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,279
published in peer-reviewed journals and

1088
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,040
not all

1089
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,400
peer-reviewed journals have have open

1090
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:42,240
data and open access

1091
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:45,359
policy policies but increasingly

1092
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,680
journals have so so if you for example

1093
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:50,078
go to the carbon brief

1094
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,000
website and look at the map of studies

1095
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,040
that you have links to all the studies

1096
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,880
and

1097
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,880
a lot of them have the data available

1098
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,400
okay maybe a follow-up to this one

1099
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,240
the next question is are the models

1100
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,680
somehow available or usable

1101
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,640
or a white wider interest public or is

1102
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,960
apc

1103
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,799
required i'm not quite sure what apc

1104
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,000
means

1105
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:22,160
um so the model data is publicly

1106
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,119
available from and this is one reason

1107
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,240
why in we have been able to do these

1108
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,680
studies because

1109
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:31,279
until relatively recently model data was

1110
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,399
not publicly available and only

1111
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,800
scientists

1112
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,640
working in a specific country could use

1113
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,680
the model developed in that country

1114
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:42,799
but now all the model data is is

1115
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,440
shared publicly and and people can use

1116
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,560
it

1117
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,480
um so it's it's definitely there and

1118
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,880
usable it just requires

1119
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,520
um some expertise to make sense of it

1120
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,960
but it's

1121
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,960
yeah people can use it

1122
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,960
okay the next question is towards

1123
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,599
certainty

1124
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,560
can you set up the counterfactual models

1125
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,200
which are an

1126
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,040
important reference to the to your

1127
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,879
percentage value

1128
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,560
and what data are the base for these

1129
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,920
models

1130
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:19,119
so the counterfactual um simulations

1131
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,200
are so the climate models we use are

1132
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,040
basically the same models that are used

1133
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,000
also for the weather forecast they are

1134
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,119
just run in

1135
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,880
lower resolution so um which i guess

1136
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,240
most of this audience knows what that

1137
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,560
that means so

1138
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,879
the data points are further apart so

1139
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:38,799
that it's not so computing intensive

1140
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:41,599
and these models um they are

1141
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,359
they are tested against observed data

1142
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,720
and so that is how we do the model

1143
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:48,240
evaluation so that is the

1144
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:51,200
simulations of the present day and

1145
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,598
for the counterfactual we know extremely

1146
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:56,240
well

1147
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:59,200
well how many greenhouse gases have been

1148
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,078
yeah included into the atmosphere since

1149
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,919
the beginning of

1150
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,599
the industrial revolution so that there

1151
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,319
is a very large certainty with that

1152
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,440
number

1153
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:09,040
and we remove that from the model's

1154
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,079
atmosphere so the models have

1155
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,319
exactly the same setup but

1156
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,760
by the lower greenhouse gases a lower

1157
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,960
amount of greenhouse gases in their

1158
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,400
atmosphere and then

1159
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:23,599
are spun up uh and and and run in

1160
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,520
exactly the same way so the

1161
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,359
but of course we can't test the counter

1162
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,960
factual and so

1163
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:34,240
um that means that we assume

1164
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,359
that the the sort of the the weather was

1165
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,799
still

1166
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,240
uh the same physics will still hold in

1167
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,880
the counterfactual

1168
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,359
and that the models that are developed

1169
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,680
using

1170
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,759
using present day represent uh the

1171
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,598
counterfactual which is

1172
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,200
which is an assumption but it's not a

1173
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,480
completely unreasonable assumption

1174
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,759
because of course

1175
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:58,720
we we have now

1176
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,440
um decades of model development and have

1177
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,399
seen

1178
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,400
that in fact that indeed climate model

1179
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,040
projections that have been made 30 years

1180
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,079
ago

1181
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:10,160
have actually come come to be

1182
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,200
have been realized in pretty much the

1183
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,879
same way

1184
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:17,359
um on on a large scale that they have um

1185
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,920
as they had been predicted 30 years ago

1186
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:21,279
and so

1187
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,559
that that assumption is not um yeah it's

1188
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,400
not a big assumption

1189
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,160
so the counterfactual itself is not a

1190
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,640
problem but of course

1191
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,200
also the present day model simulations

1192
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,200
they are

1193
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,879
they are not they are very far from

1194
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,520
perfect and there are some types of

1195
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,079
events

1196
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,599
which state-of-the-art climate models

1197
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,720
just can't simulate

1198
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:43,119
and so um where we can

1199
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,640
where we can say very little so well for

1200
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:47,839
example for hurricanes

1201
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,920
we can say uh with with red with high

1202
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:51,040
certainty about the rainfall associated

1203
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,839
with hurricanes

1204
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:56,160
the hurricane strength itself and the

1205
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,839
frequency of hurricanes is something

1206
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,319
which which is very difficult to

1207
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,200
simulate uh with state-of-the-art models

1208
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:05,359
so

1209
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,359
our our uncertainty there is much higher

1210
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:13,520
okay and then

1211
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,240
well some one one question that that

1212
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,759
emerges

1213
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:21,040
from all this is of course if we uh

1214
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:24,160
know this much and way more than

1215
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:26,480
than in the past uh how

1216
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:29,279
are politicians still ignoring that

1217
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:32,880
information and how can we

1218
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:37,119
can can we convey that into their uh

1219
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:39,440
minds well if i knew the answer to that

1220
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:43,040
i would probably not be standing here

1221
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,559
but but actually doing um doing politics

1222
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,920
but i think

1223
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:50,880
um it takes a frustratingly

1224
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,000
long time for things to change and

1225
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,040
things should change

1226
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,160
much faster but

1227
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,720
we actually the last two years have

1228
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,399
shown

1229
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:05,680
huge progress i think in terms of also

1230
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:09,200
putting climate change on the agenda

1231
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,160
of every politician um because and

1232
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,720
that's

1233
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,598
largely due to the fridays for futures

1234
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,879
movement

1235
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:18,480
um but also to to degree i think due to

1236
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,440
the fact that we

1237
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,559
now actually know that the weather that

1238
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,319
people experience

1239
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,240
in their backyard and pretty much

1240
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:29,599
independent of where that backyard

1241
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:33,359
is is not the same as it used to be

1242
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:36,800
and so people do experience today

1243
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:39,759
climate change and i think that um

1244
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,480
that does help to bring a bit more

1245
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,559
urgency

1246
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,800
and of course well i've said everyone

1247
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,880
has climate change on their agenda

1248
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,960
which was very different even two years

1249
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,520
ago where there were lots of people who

1250
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,520
have

1251
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,599
who would never talk about climate

1252
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,000
change and their political agendas has

1253
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,119
played

1254
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,240
no rule it doesn't mean that it's it's

1255
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:03,760
uh it has the right priority

1256
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,720
on um on that agenda but it's still a

1257
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,319
huge step

1258
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:11,919
forward that has been made and

1259
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:14,200
so i think we do know some things

1260
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,599
that do work um

1261
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:19,118
[Music]

1262
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:22,160
but we just we have to just

1263
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:26,880
keep doing that um i

1264
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:29,040
yeah i don't think i can say more uh

1265
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,440
i don't have a magic wand to change it

1266
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,440
otherwise

1267
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:37,680
maybe some some other point of impact

1268
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,119
one of the question is is it possible to

1269
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,440
turn the results of

1270
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:42,240
attribution studies into recommendations

1271
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:46,000
for

1272
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:49,040
farmers and people who are affected

1273
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,280
in a financial way by extreme weather

1274
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,240
and how to change agriculture to reduce

1275
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,119
losses from

1276
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,919
uh extreme weather effects yes

1277
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:59,200
absolutely

1278
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:02,400
so that is one of the one of the most

1279
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,078
useful things of these studies is well

1280
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,599
on the one hand to raise awareness but

1281
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,240
on the other hand if you know

1282
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,800
that a drought that you have experienced

1283
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,078
that has

1284
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,520
led to losses is a harbinger of what

1285
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,800
what is to come

1286
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:20,000
um then that is

1287
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,319
incredibly helpful uh to know how to

1288
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,680
that agricultural practices might need

1289
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:26,319
to be changed or

1290
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:28,160
that insurance for losses from

1291
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:30,160
agriculture

1292
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,359
might need to be changed and so this is

1293
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,799
this is exactly

1294
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:37,359
why um why we do these attribution

1295
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:40,559
studies because not every extreme event

1296
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:43,040
is always because has

1297
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,760
always shows the fingerprints of climate

1298
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,880
change

1299
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,559
and uh if you if you know which of the

1300
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,640
events are the ones for climate change

1301
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,280
it's a real game changer you also do

1302
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,839
know

1303
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,640
where to to put your efforts and

1304
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:57,440
resources

1305
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:58,879
to be more more resilient in the future

1306
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,480
and for financial losses

1307
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:05,200
it's um it is on the one hand um

1308
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,520
yeah you you can use these studies to

1309
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,799
find out what your physical risks are

1310
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:13,119
for your assets um and and how they

1311
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,119
and of course this everything that i've

1312
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,240
said comparing the counterfactual with

1313
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:18,160
the present

1314
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,319
we can do and we do this also with the

1315
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:23,839
future so you can also see how

1316
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:26,839
in a two-degree world the um the events

1317
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:28,640
uh likelihood and intensities are

1318
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:31,599
changing and of course

1319
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,000
you can then also in a less direct way

1320
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,160
use

1321
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,640
this kind of information to see to

1322
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:39,839
assess what what might be other

1323
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,960
risks from where where might be stranded

1324
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:43,119
assets

1325
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,079
what what are other risks for the

1326
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:46,720
financial

1327
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:48,160
um for the financial sector for the

1328
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,279
financial planning

1329
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:52,720
um what where could liability risks be

1330
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,720
and how could they look like so

1331
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:58,799
there is um because

1332
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,480
extreme weather events and their changes

1333
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:04,720
in intensity and magnitude

1334
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:07,839
is how climate change is manifesting

1335
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:10,000
it it really connects all these um

1336
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:13,359
all these aspects of where where the

1337
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,359
impacts of climate change are

1338
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:21,759
okay um last

1339
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:25,520
question for today i hope i

1340
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,960
can um get that right i think the

1341
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,640
question is

1342
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:35,200
if there are study if there are studies

1343
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:38,400
um on our uh how we cultivate

1344
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:41,799
fields in agriculture how does this

1345
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,040
impact um the the overall um

1346
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:45,599
[Music]

1347
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,160
climate in in that area the example here

1348
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,960
is uh

1349
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,759
is it only an increase in water

1350
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,119
consumption

1351
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:56,400
uh was directed to sao paulo

1352
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:58,799
or might there also be a

1353
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:01,280
warm wall created by monu culture in

1354
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:04,559
central brazil

1355
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:08,480
so um yeah i don't know

1356
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:11,839
details um but there are but land use

1357
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:13,680
changes and land use does play a role

1358
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:15,599
uh on the one hand it affects the

1359
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:19,520
climate so if you have

1360
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:21,520
um if you have a a rain

1361
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,119
have a very different climate in that

1362
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:26,799
location as if there is a

1363
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:28,960
savannah or plantation and um

1364
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:30,319
and also of course if you have

1365
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:34,240
monocultures

1366
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:37,119
um you're you're much more

1367
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,879
your losses are larger usually as if you

1368
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:41,920
have different types of

1369
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,160
of of agriculture because um because

1370
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,000
in a monoculture everything is in

1371
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:49,279
exactly the same way vulnerable

1372
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,520
and uh and so that yeah so that that

1373
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,200
does land use change plays a hugely

1374
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:56,319
important role

1375
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:59,118
with respect to um the impacts of

1376
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:00,558
of extreme weather and that's one thing

1377
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,240
to look at when i was saying

1378
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:04,480
talking about looking at vulnerability

1379
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,479
and exposure and of course also

1380
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,079
changes in the hazard are not just

1381
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,079
because of climate change

1382
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:12,240
but also because of land use change and

1383
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:14,960
you can use exactly the same methods

1384
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,558
but instead of changing the co2 or the

1385
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,119
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere of

1386
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,920
your model

1387
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:21,359
you can change the land use and then

1388
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,839
disentangle

1389
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:25,839
these different drivers in in hazards

1390
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:32,720
okay greedy otto thank you very much for

1391
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:35,440
your presentation and for the q and a

1392
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,000
it was a pleasure to have you with us

1393
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,839
and

1394
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:43,280
um yeah if you have any questions

1395
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:46,400
any more questions um i guess there are

1396
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:49,359
ways to contact you i think

1397
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,839
your email address and contact details

1398
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:52,160
are

1399
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:54,078
in the far plan if you uh for all the

1400
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,960
viewers that that wants uh that have

1401
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:57,760
way more questions and i i don't know do

1402
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,839
you have

1403
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,559
access to the 2d world and do you

1404
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:02,558
explore that

1405
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:07,919
uh given that i don't know what you mean

1406
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:11,839
probably not but

1407
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:14,480
okay but it would be

1408
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:15,680
yeah it's uh it's it's the the uh

1409
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:19,280
replacement for

1410
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:22,558
um for the congress place itself

1411
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:24,839
but anyway if uh if you viewers and

1412
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:26,079
