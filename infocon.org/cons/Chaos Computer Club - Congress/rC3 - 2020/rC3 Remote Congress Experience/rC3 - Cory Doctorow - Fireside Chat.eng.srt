1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:10,520
[Music]

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,520
[Applause]

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,400

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,439

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,519

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,920
corey we just had a little chat before

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,038
and

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:31,199
um yes as i know uh you will be

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:34,079
reading from your new book in a minute

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,960
as i just stopped talking and afterwards

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,000
there will be

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:42,399
a lot of time for all your questions

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,320
and we're really curious already and now

14
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,079
great yeah and i do have these questions

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,200
from the uh from the talk earlier and

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,800
i'm going to try and get to those two

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,600
i'm going to do a shorter reading so we

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,399
can do more

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,680
uh interactive stuff um you can watch

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,600
videos of me

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,079
on youtube if you want to it's more fun

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,000
to interact um so the the passage you're

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,600
going to read comes from attack surface

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,280
attack surface is a standalone little

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,000
brother novel uh

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,760
and it's intended for adults and it

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,040
stars masha who's the young woman is the

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,400
beginning of the end of the other two

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,280
books working as a surveillance

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,960
contractor

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,119
and by this third book she's she's like

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,520
a full-on cyber mercenary working for a

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,600
company a lot like say the nso group or

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,679
or hacking team or any of those other

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,679
kind of hack for hire companies

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,799
helping post-soviet dictators crush

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,320
rebellions

38
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,079
and the way that she uh goes to sleep at

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,199
night and still manages to like square

40
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,199
up her conscience

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,560
is by helping the people that she spies

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,000
on so during the day she installs

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,159
surveillance appliances

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,920
in the national data centers and at

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,759
night she meets with the protesters who

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,280
are being spied on using this technology

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,040
and tells them what countermeasures work

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,600
for it and so

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,439
this is uh set very early in the novel

50
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,360
and masha and christina who's one of

51
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,158
these local protesters

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,880
are walking through the square in the

53
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,200
fictional

54
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,199
uh post-soviet republic of slovstakia

55
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,799
during the the beginnings of a protest

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,479
that is shaping up to be a very serious

57
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,119
one

58
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,560
the square buzzed with good energy there

59
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,919
was a line of grannies who brought out

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,599
pots and wooden

61
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,319
whanging away at them chanting something

62
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,920
in boris that made everyone understand

63
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,839
christina tried to translate it but it

64
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,440
was all tangled up with some baba yaga

65
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,680
story that every sloofstakian learned

66
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,359
with their mother's borscht recipes

67
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,200
we stopped at a barrel fire and

68
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,400
distributed the last couple of kebabs to

69
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,280
the people there

70
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,040
a girl a girl i'd seen around emerged

71
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,480
from the crowd and stole christina away

72
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,160
to hold a muttered conference that i

73
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,399
followed by watching the body language

74
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,920
out of the corner of my eye i decided

75
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,680
that some of christina's contacts had

76
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,518
someone on the inside of the neo-nazi

77
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,440
camp and judging from her reaction the

78
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,280
news was very bad

79
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,239
what i asked she shook her head what

80
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,760
10 p.m she said they charge supposedly

81
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,239
some of the cops will go over to their

82
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,879
side

83
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,400
there's been money changing hands that

84
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,000
was one of the problems with putting

85
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,400
your cops on half pay

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,560
someone might pay the other half the

87
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,400
slostakian police had developed a keen

88
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,440
instinct for staying one one

89
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,120
jump ahead of purges and turnovers

90
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,040
the ones that didn't develop that

91
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,519
instinct ended up in their own cells or

92
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,799
dead at their own colleagues hands how

93
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,440
many

94
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,440
borises are world-class shruggers even

95
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,359
adorable pixies like christina

96
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,560
if the english have 200 words for

97
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,799
passive aggressive

98
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,040
and the inuit have 200 words for snow

99
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,720
then boris's can convey 200 gradations

100
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,840
of emotions with their shoulders

101
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,440
and i read this one as some enough

102
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,280
too many we are no martyrs

103
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,879
christina if it's that bad we can come

104
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,640
back another night

105
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,079
if it's that bad there might not be

106
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,279
another night

107
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,720
oh that fatalism fine i said

108
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,640
then we do something about it like what

109
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,040
like you get me a place to sit and keep

110
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,720
everyone else away from me for an hour

111
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,319
the crash barricades around the square

112
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,920
had been long colonized by

113
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,000
tarps and turned into shelters where

114
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,679
protesters could get away from the lines

115
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,280
when they needed a break

116
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,040
christina returned a few after a few

117
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,000
minutes to lead me to an empty corner of

118
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,560
the warren

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,920
it smelled of b.o and cabbage farts but

120
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,280
it was in the lee of the wind and

121
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,119
private enough

122
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,480
doubling my long coats tails under my

123
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,798
butt for insulation

124
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,000
i sat down cross-legged and tethered my

125
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,000
laptop

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,320
a few minutes later i was staring at

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,240
commander liftin chuck's email school

128
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,680
i had a remote desktop on his computer

129
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,479
and could have used his own webmail

130
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,160
interface

131
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,479
but it was faster to just slither into

132
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,320
the mail server itself

133
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,919
thankfully one of his first edicts after

134
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,680
taking over the ministry had been to

135
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,159
migrate everyone off gmail

136
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,680
which was secured by 24 7 ninja hackers

137
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,520
who'd eat me for breakfast

138
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,680
and onto a hosted mail server in the

139
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,080
same data center that i'd spent 16 hours

140
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,160
in

141
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,080
which was secured by wishful thinking

142
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,600
bubble gum and spit

143
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,440
that meant that if the u.s state

144
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,080
department wanted to pound the slovakian

145
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,520
government

146
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,120
it would have to engage in a trivial

147
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,880
hack against that machine

148
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,280
rather than facing google's vicious

149
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,520
notoriously vicious lawyers

150
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,719
the guiding light of boris politics was

151
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,320
trust no one

152
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,080
which meant they had to do it all for

153
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,080
themselves

154
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,080
lift and chuck cell site simulators all

155
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,840
fed into a big analytic system

156
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,240
that mapped social graphs and compiled

157
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,758
dossiers he demanded that the chiefs of

158
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,520
police and military gather the

159
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,520
identifiers of all their personnel so

160
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,359
they could be whitelisted in the system

161
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,520
it wouldn't do to have every riot cop

162
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,919
placed under suspicio under suspicion

163
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,240
because they were present at every riot

164
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,320
the file was in a saved email

165
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,400
i tabbed over to a different interface

166
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,919
tunneled into the zoth appliance

167
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,080
it quickly digested the file and

168
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,960
spattered all the sms messages sent to

169
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,198
or from any cop since i'd switched it on

170
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,239
i called christina over she hunkered

171
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,759
down next to me

172
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,240
passed me a thermos of coffee she'd

173
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,080
acquired somewhere it was terrible and

174
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,240
it reminded me of marcus

175
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,680
marcus and his precious coffee he

176
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,880
wouldn't last 10 minutes in a real

177
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,160
radical uprising

178
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,120
because he wouldn't be able to find

179
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,360
artisanal coffee roasters in the melee

180
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,240
christina help me search these texts for

181
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,479
these texts for

182
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,199
uh help me search these for texts about

183
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,039
letting the nazis get past the lines

184
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,720
she looked at my screen the long

185
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,080
scrolling list of texts from cop's

186
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,880
phones

187
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,639
what is that it's what it looks like

188
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,560
every message sent to or from a cop's

189
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,319
phone in the last 10 hours or so

190
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,680
i can't read it though which is why i

191
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,160
need your help

192
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,840
she boggled all cheekbones and tilted

193
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,600
eyes and sensuous lips

194
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,359
then she started mousing the scroll up

195
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,759
and down to read through them

196
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,160
holy she said in slostakin which

197
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,840
was one of the few phrases i knew

198
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,280
then to her credit she seemed to get

199
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,880
past her surprise and dug into the

200
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,239
messages themselves

201
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,039
how do i search here i open the search

202
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,639
dialogue

203
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,599
let me know if you need help with wild

204
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,120
cards christina wasn't a hacker but i

205
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,360
taught her a little regular expression

206
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,280
food to help her with an earlier project

207
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,520
regex are one of the secret weapons of

208
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,359
hackerdom compact search strings that

209
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,880
parse through huge files for incredibly

210
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,960
specific patterns

211
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,240
if you didn't them up which most

212
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,638
people did

213
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,680
she tried a few tentative searches am i

214
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,000
looking for names

215
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,120
passwords something that would freak out

216
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,680
the interior ministry

217
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,479
we're gonna forward a bunch of these she

218
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,120
stopped and stared at me all eyelashes

219
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,599
it's a joke it won't look like it came

220
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,960
from us

221
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,719
it'll look like it came from a source

222
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,318
inside the ministry

223
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,759
she stared some more of the hamsters

224
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,039
running around on their wheels behind

225
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,960
her eyes

226
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,719
masha how do you do this we had a deal

227
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,719
i'd help you and you wouldn't ask me

228
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,400
questions i struck that deal with her

229
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,960
after our first night on the barricades

230
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,318
together

231
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,239
when i'd shown her how to flash her

232
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,000
phone with paranoid android and we'd

233
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,680
watch the stingrays bounce off of it as

234
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
she moved around the square

235
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,280
she knew i did something for an american

236
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,280
security contractor

237
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,400
and had googled my connection with mikey

238
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,878
whom she worshipped

239
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,000
naturally i'd read the messages she'd

240
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,840
sent to her cell's chat

241
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,680
channels sticking up for me as a trustee

242
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,159
sidekick trustworthy sidekick

243
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,759
to their amerikanski hero a couple of

244
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,599
the others had wisely and

245
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,039
almost correctly assumed that i was a

246
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,800
police informant

247
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,560
it looked like maybe she was regretting

248
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,879
not listening to them

249
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,680
i waited talking first would surrender

250
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,400
the initiative make me look weak

251
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,199
if we can't trust you we're already dead

252
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,919
she said

253
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,720
finally that's true luckily you can

254
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,440
trust me

255
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,000
search we worked through some queries

256
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
together

257
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,879
and i showed her how to use wild cards

258
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,400
to expand her searches without having

259
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,759
them spill over the whole mountain of

260
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,039
short messages

261
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,479
it would have gone faster if i could

262
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,800
have read the cirilla characters but i

263
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,640
had to rely on christina for that

264
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,560
when we had a good representative sample

265
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,159
around hundred enough to be convincing

266
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,679
not so many that litvin chuck wouldn't

267
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,000
be able to digest them

268
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,079
i composed an email to him in english

269
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,839
this wasn't as weird as it might seem

270
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,440
he had recruited senior staff from all

271
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,360
over the from all over europe and a

272
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,600
couple of south african mercs

273
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,600
and they just a pigeon they all used a

274
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,279
kind of pigeon english among themselves

275
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,040
with generous pastings from google

276
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,760
translate because opsec

277
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,719
right fractured english was a lot easier

278
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,279
to fake than

279
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,560
native speech even so i wasn't going to

280
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,240
leave this to chance

281
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,839
i grabbed a couple thousand emails from

282
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,880
the mid-level bureaucrat i was planning

283
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,320
on impersonating

284
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,000
and threw them in a cloud machine where

285
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,680
i kept a fork of anonymous

286
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,680
a plagiarism detector that used

287
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,599
stylometry to profile the grammar

288
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,680
syntax and vocabulary from a training

289
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,519
set then evaluated new text to see if

290
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,120
they seemed by the same author

291
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,640
i trained my anonymous on several

292
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,320
thousand individual profiles from

293
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,199
journalists and bloggers to every one of

294
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,120
my bosses

295
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,959
which was sometimes handy in figuring

296
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,600
out when someone was using a ghostwriter

297
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,800
or a delegated to a subordinate mainly

298
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,480
though i used it for my own

299
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,760
impersonations

300
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,519
i'm sure that other people have thought

301
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,040
about using stylometry to fine-tune

302
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,640
impersonations but no one's talking

303
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,240
about it than i can find

304
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,080
it didn't take much work for me to tweak

305
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,040
anonymous to give me a ranked order list

306
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,120
of suggestions

307
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,160
to make my forgery less detectable to

308
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,000
anonymous

309
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,160
shorten this sentence find a synonym for

310
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,160
that word add a couple of commas

311
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,319
after a few passes through my forgeries

312
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,360
could fool humans and robots

313
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,200
every time i had a guy in mind for my

314
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,560
whistleblower one of the south africans

315
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,160
nicholas van dijk

316
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,479
i'd seen him in action in a bunch of

317
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,439
flame wars with his with his slovakian

318
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,560
counterparts

319
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,880
friction that would make him a

320
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,880
believable rat i played it up giving

321
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,399
nicholas some thinly veiled grievances

322
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,079
about how much dough his enemies were

323
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,760
raking in for their treachery

324
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,839
and fishing for a little finder's fee

325
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,319
for his being such a straight arrow

326
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,079
versus militude liffen chuck would go

327
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,079
predictably apeshit when he learned that

328
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,839
his corpse was riddled with traitors

329
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,439
but even he'd noticed something was off

330
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,040
of a like van dyke

331
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,480
where to nark out his teammates without

332
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,680
trying to get something for himself in

333
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,360
the deal

334
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,439
a couple of passes through anonymous and

335
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,320
i had a candidate text along with a url

336
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,959
for a pastebin that i put the sms's into

337
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,760
no one at the interior ministry used pgp

338
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,399
for email

339
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,120
because no human normal human being does

340
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,959
and so it was

341
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,120
simplicity itself to manufacture an

342
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,800
email in the in litvin chuck's inbox

343
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,200
that was indistinguishable from the real

344
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,120
thing i even forged the headers for the

345
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,040
same reason that a dollhouse builder

346
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,399
paints tiny titles on the spines of the

347
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,160
books in the living room

348
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,160
even though no one will ever see them

349
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,680
there's a professional pride in getting

350
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,839
the details right

351
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,839
also i had a script that did it for me

352
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,760
well there we go

353
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,399
i think uh you should uh yeah we all

354
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,279
think the

355
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,160
big applause right now i just realized

356
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,320
that um

357
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,760
i found out about a non-mouth at 25 c3

358
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,800
completely like when i chose the reading

359
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,000
i wasn't thinking about that and as i

360
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,880
was reading i was like

361
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,920
didn't i learn about this at a ccc and i

362
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,720
did

363
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,360
and now you're writing about it yeah

364
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
yeah

365
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,040
that's why i write off my trips to

366
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,760
hacker cons

367
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,240
uh so do you actually use all those

368
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,120
things for your research

369
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,560
um many of them i can't say that i use

370
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,240
anonymous because i don't have to forge

371
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,399
many things nor do i have to

372
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,920
uh puncture forgeries but i mean the

373
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,399
thing that immediately struck me during

374
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,199
the anonymous presentation was um

375
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,800
if if you were like a fanfic writer who

376
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,120
wanted to find all the ways that your

377
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,880
harry potter story was not quite like a

378
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,160
jk rowling harry potter story you could

379
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,120
then tweak

380
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,800
your story to rolling a fight uh using

381
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,680
anonymous right using this this

382
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,439
uh uh plagiarism detector you know

383
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,279
adversary stylometry tool

384
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,720
um of course today if you just wanted to

385
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,399
make it seem like jk rowling you'd throw

386
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,480
in some transphobic stuff so

387
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,600
that would that would be the clincher

388
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,639
probably yes

389
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,560
yeah um but there's a and a pretty

390
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,920
interesting discussion after

391
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,518
that um because uh there are lots of of

392
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:41,279
authors and actually publishers

393
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:45,040
so um freaking out about uh

394
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,519
text ais that can generate attacks that

395
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,800
are

396
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:53,200
pretty good already not like human yet

397
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:56,000
but pretty good um

398
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,279
i think there's something behind that

399
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,560
already

400
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,800
i used a gpt gpt3 composition tool

401
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,839
that some people i know built and played

402
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,279
around with it

403
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,480
and it is really far from doing the kind

404
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,959
of work i do

405
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,480
uh i don't know i won't say that it's

406
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,719
really far from automating some tasks

407
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,240
obviously it automates some tasks

408
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:21,360
um but i i think that um

409
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,040
the state of gpt3 is such that if

410
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,480
you are worried about losing your job to

411
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,160
gpt 3

412
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,399
you probably have a really boring

413
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,839
terrible job because it's it's not

414
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,320
producing anything that

415
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,680
i mean apart like from kind of text art

416
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,079
it's fun text art

417
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,599
i i mean i think maybe you could like

418
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,120
replace internet trolls

419
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,639
with it you know every now and again

420
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,880
i'll write about like um

421
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,040
you know criticism of modi and these

422
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,040
these huge like uh hindu nationalist

423
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,880
troll armies will come after me

424
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,560
and that the messages are so

425
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,160
self-similar that they're really easy to

426
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,079
to identify and block you don't even

427
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,800
like you second word it's just like

428
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,199
you know blog report and away you go uh

429
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,399
but

430
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:03,359
um if they had like a good uh

431
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,279
gpt3 package they could probably make a

432
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,959
whole series of harassing messages that

433
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,880
would be harder to detect

434
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,479
but again like i'm not worried about

435
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,439
those people losing their jobs i am

436
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,399
worried about the

437
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,160
you know the possibility of um like vast

438
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,720
disinformation campaigns that are

439
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,920
harder to block or detect but not not

440
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,320
about the um

441
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,079
you know technology technology driven

442
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,600
automation unemployment

443
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,239
as a result of all of the internet

444
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,199
trolls being replaced

445
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,160
yeah i'm totally with you um at that

446
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,279
point because

447
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:38,240
um there will always be um

448
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,880
yeah the love for human generated texts

449
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,680
for for the art after uh or behind it

450
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,120
and

451
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,599
um yeah

452
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,040
a lot of a lot of the most remarkable

453
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,519
gpt3

454
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,199
blocks that have appeared right where

455
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,160
people have like used gpt3 to make

456
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,479
something

457
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,839
turn out to be straight up copy paste of

458
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,120
actual text written by humans because

459
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,839
gpt3

460
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,079
sometimes will just regurgitate like

461
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,480
half paragraphs whole paragraphs

462
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,160
that uh are part of its training data

463
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,199
and so again like that is a very

464
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,439
impressive

465
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,279
task right finding their like the best

466
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,040
paragraph from a bunch of pre-written

467
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,199
paragraphs by humans

468
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,639
that is impressive and it's it amounts

469
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,319
to something but it's not the same as

470
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,560
composing it

471
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,399
yeah that's totally right and it was

472
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,959
pretty depressing

473
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,440
other thing but uh pretty pressing when

474
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,518
we put

475
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:35,040
some um some uh legal texts

476
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,839
into a markov chain and made a uh a game

477
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,199
okay which is the real legal tax which

478
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,240
is the mark of chain

479
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,639
and we made three or four rounds and uh

480
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,959
people

481
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,160
always failed yeah i'm not surprised i

482
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,959
mean it's a

483
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,199
it's a an open secret that like it was

484
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,959
several months after twitter's launch

485
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,279
that someone noticed that twitter's

486
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,680
terms of service represent

487
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,880
repeatedly mentioned flickr because they

488
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,560
copied and pasted

489
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,160
flickr's terms of service to make them

490
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,479
twitter's terms of service

491
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,000
and like no one not even twitter's

492
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,160
lawyers had read

493
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,680
the terms of service to notice that i

494
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,759
didn't mention twitter

495
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,519
so you know i i'm not surprised like

496
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,000
literally nobody reads those right those

497
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,440
are like

498
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,600
um self-reproducing text viruses yeah

499
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,120
actually they are shall we have a look

500
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,160
into the questions we still have yeah

501
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,040
so we do have two parts i think

502
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,480
right i only have one of them uh i think

503
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,199
you have the one from the

504
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,480
uh from your previous four talk so i can

505
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,279
why don't i answer one or two of these

506
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,000
and then you can

507
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,720
think about the um the rest of these

508
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,440
right

509
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,440
so uh

510
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,759
what's uh where's the one that i liked

511
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,480
here oh um

512
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,839
was um we can't use anti-monopoly

513
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,440
uh it's not like you can dissolve

514
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,880
facebook overnight realistically what's

515
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
the roadmap to a more sustainable

516
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,839
environment

517
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,160
so i think that misunderstands the

518
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,759
benefits of a protracted antitrust

519
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,520
action that um you know if if

520
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,360
if we were to say to facebook all right

521
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,160
we're we're going to break out

522
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,000
uh whatsapp and uh and insta which i

523
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,319
think we could do even without invoking

524
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,480
anti-monopoly law i think you could say

525
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,918
that especially in the eu

526
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,400
their uh merger was was contingent on

527
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,400
them

528
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,839
not merging the back ends of facebook

529
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,520
instagram and whatsapp

530
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,958
and then they later merged the back ends

531
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,160
of facebook instagram and whatsapp and i

532
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,000
think if you are given

533
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,360
um regulatory forbearance if you're

534
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,200
given an exemption

535
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,399
to a regulation uh on promise of certain

536
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,320
conduct

537
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,600
then if you engage in that conduct then

538
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,639
we should just revoke it

539
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,799
right we should just revoke the the uh

540
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,160
the the forbearance i think that's a

541
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,039
pretty straightforward

542
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,200
lift but even if it were to take a long

543
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,400
time even if we spent a decade

544
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,280
trying to make google spin out its ad

545
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,440
tech stack

546
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:02,639
which i think we should do that 10 years

547
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,559
would really like dramatically alter

548
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,679
the way that investors and corporate

549
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,918
executives

550
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,440
thought about anti-competitive conduct

551
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,640
right it would it would get

552
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:16,559
all of the the people who

553
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,200
are currently uh when they balance out

554
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,918
you know the

555
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,720
the upside of monopoly and the downside

556
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,559
of monopoly

557
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,000
it would weight the downside much more

558
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,520
heavily and

559
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,360
you would get the kind of forbearance

560
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,918
you got say from ibm

561
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,360
when they they didn't go after uh tom

562
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,160
jennings when he was making the phoenix

563
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,120
rom

564
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,240
uh and and you would then see things

565
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,479
like investment

566
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,080
so you know the thing that that um

567
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,559
market believers

568
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,399
say about markets is that they respond

569
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,760
very quickly and regulators respond

570
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,720
slowly and that's true

571
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,080
the markets markets are very quick um

572
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,080
you can see that in the

573
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,559
growth of technologies over the crisis

574
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,520
right like think of how quickly markets

575
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,879
turn zoom into the thing that we all use

576
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,280
right it's it was

577
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,960
you know if you tried to regulate a a

578
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,360
video conferencing system

579
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,720
the by the time the consultations were

580
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,918
done and so on it would have been years

581
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,360
later

582
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,039
and markets are actually pretty good at

583
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,879
fighting monopolies

584
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,039
if they're well regulated right that

585
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,960
that you know the reason that um

586
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,160
venture capitalists don't fund facebook

587
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,200
competitors

588
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,120
is not because they uh

589
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,480
you know love facebook and they don't

590
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,199
they wouldn't want to see facebook in

591
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,400
trouble

592
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,000
it's because they think that if they

593
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,120
tried to fight facebook facebook would

594
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,240
destroy them

595
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,959
and so if we were to put facebook on

596
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,720
notice

597
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,000
that everything it did from now on was

598
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,120
going to be part of this ongoing

599
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,880
antitrust action

600
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,239
which i think just happened right just

601
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,640
before christmas with the new

602
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,360
uh slate of anti-trust suits against

603
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,039
them

604
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,559
then uh if you can make that if you can

605
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,919
make an investor understand that you

606
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,480
could get capital

607
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,600
to start a competitor to facebook now in

608
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,520
terms of

609
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,520
what we can do that fits between

610
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,879
antitrust action

611
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,320
and nothing uh what we can do to get

612
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,559
like jammed today instead of jam

613
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,399
tomorrow

614
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,000
there's two courses involving

615
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,000
interoperability so

616
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,039
one of them is is already in the digital

617
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,320
services act

618
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,320
it was in the access act that was

619
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,840
proposed in the u.s last year

620
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,480
and the um the the dsa and the

621
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,320
and the um access act both have these

622
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,679
mandatory interoperability

623
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,158
components where they say you know

624
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,840
facebook must produce an interface

625
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,960
that third parties can log into and they

626
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,158
have different ways of trying to make

627
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,679
sure that that third party is in

628
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,799
cambridge analytica

629
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,880
and it's gonna be it'll it's hard but

630
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,918
it will it will open some regulatory

631
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,760
space inc

632
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,960
in concert with these anti-trust uh

633
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,000
enforcement actions

634
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,520
but even more exciting would be uh

635
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,640
an interoperator's defense a a law

636
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:54,080
or a regulation that said

637
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,080
if you devise a way to interface a new

638
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,879
product with an existing product

639
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,480
for a legitimate purpose including

640
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,960
increased consumer freedom

641
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,400
security auditing uh accessibility for

642
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,480
people with disabilities

643
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,520
and you know uh independent repair and

644
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,840
so on

645
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,360
that notwithstanding any laws software

646
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,199
patents copyrights

647
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,639
terms of service trade secrecy

648
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,720
non-compete

649
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,240
you have an absolute defense and

650
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,120
obviously passing that law would be

651
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,080
really hard

652
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,080
but it wouldn't have to come

653
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,000
legislatively like you could imagine

654
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,600
bits and pieces of it emerging like

655
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,799
maybe we say uh to facebook

656
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,559
that the remedy for its unlawful and

657
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,840
deceptive merger with instagram and

658
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,240
whatsapp

659
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,039
is that they have to sign a consent

660
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,480
decree

661
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,400
saying they won't punish people who

662
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,200
build interoperable services on this

663
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,640
basis

664
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,240
and so they have to act as though that

665
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,960
were the law even if it wasn't the law

666
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,120
or we might see

667
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,720
things like a procurement guideline

668
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,239
where you know we might we might have

669
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,320
educational authorities

670
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,480
who say to google uh yeah we're gonna

671
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,080
buy google classroom site licenses for

672
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,120
all of our lockdown kids

673
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:02,158
but as a condition of that you have to

674
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,000
uh promise that you will not seek any

675
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,480
kind of vengeance against people

676
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
who do the following things or or we

677
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,000
might say to apple

678
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,080
as a procurement matter if we're going

679
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,039
to buy 50 000 ipads for our school

680
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,799
district

681
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,559
you have to promise not to sue people

682
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,480
who produce side loading tools

683
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,480
because we have apps that our district

684
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,080
depends on and we can't

685
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,440
you know we can't be dependent on you

686
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,720
guys deciding that you don't want to

687
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,799
lock that app out

688
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,720
and so you you get this kind of like

689
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,280
multi-layered stack where you have uh

690
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,600
anti-trust enforcement that is like uh

691
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,840
poor encourage a laseotra you know

692
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,280
sometimes you have to execute an admiral

693
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,559
to encourage the rest of them

694
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,480
and that just ripples out through the

695
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,158
whole sector and then you have

696
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,880
interoperability mandates

697
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,679
through regulation that are slow moving

698
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,840
but not as slow-moving as lawsuits

699
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,200
you have new market opportunities that

700
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,439
are much faster moving that

701
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,960
will depend on both the lawsuits and the

702
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,880
and the regulation

703
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,480
and then you have unilateral actions

704
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,400
that governments can take

705
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,600
with very little constant consultation

706
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,159
without having to get things through

707
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,240
parliament

708
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,720
where they can just bind over technology

709
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,559
companies to behave in certain ways

710
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,880
so that you know they must do it like

711
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,960
imagine if the remedy for dieselgate

712
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,720
was that the german state said to

713
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,280
volkswagen and other

714
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,480
giant german automakers you are no

715
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,320
longer allowed to block

716
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,600
any independent auditing service repair

717
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,000
manufacturer parts

718
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,080
for any of your vehicles uh it's a

719
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,760
natural remedy right like it directly

720
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,600
addresses the bad conduct

721
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,440
but it also creates right to repair

722
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,080
interoperability independent security

723
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,400
auditing

724
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,000
all that stuff out of the gate and like

725
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,280
you could get it just you know

726
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,360
as part of a consent decree you could

727
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,360
get it just with the german regulator

728
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,879
talking to the lawyers for audi and

729
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,760
saying if you don't want your ceo to go

730
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,840
to jail

731
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,799
you have to sign this paper right and

732
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,879
then then you get

733
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,158
actual like fast-moving action and so i

734
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,120
think it's that kind of

735
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,159
holistic thinking about how technology

736
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,120
markets

737
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,480
law and norms all work together that

738
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,559
gets us to a solution

739
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,760
and then as against this backdrop

740
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,960
remember

741
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,520
that there are people who are worried

742
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,360
about monopolies in beer

743
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,559
who are going to be fighting your corner

744
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,799
and there's people are going to be upset

745
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,678
that all glasses are made by one company

746
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,240
luxxotica

747
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,679
in italy who've raised prices a thousand

748
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,039
percent over the last decade

749
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,799
who are also going to be fighting your

750
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,559
corner on this and so

751
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,639
you know as opposed to being a war on a

752
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,760
thousand fronts this is gonna be

753
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,520
a battle with a thousand allies and

754
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,039
that's gonna make that antitrust stuff

755
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,320
move a lot faster than it did with

756
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,879
microsoft

757
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,678
and uh because this won't be just a

758
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,559
one-off

759
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,440
uh assault on microsoft or on google or

760
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,520
on facebook

761
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,919
this is going to be like a global

762
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,840
movement to it to attack monopolism

763
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,960
itself

764
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:50,559
um as i just said markets

765
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,880
and ecosystems um there was another

766
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,480
pretty interesting question about um by

767
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,600
the way interoperability

768
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,880
and free and open source ecosystems

769
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:04,240
and um things like uh probably

770
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,679
the fatty verse or so um that

771
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,799
just rise and come up as

772
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,760
um yeah as a real alternative to

773
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,600
um the solutions we had over the last 10

774
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,799
or 15 years

775
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,240
um what do you see in those so i think

776
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,840
the thing that's missing i mean i like

777
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,400
them i use them i have a mastodon

778
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,600
account

779
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,520
i'm actually trying to stand up a

780
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,559
mastodon server right now

781
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,760
uh and but um

782
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,240
the problem with diaspora and mastodon

783
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,200
and other

784
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,400
like federated answers to facebook is

785
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,240
not centralized

786
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,919
centralization versus decentralization

787
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,480
or features versus non-features

788
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,679
it's interoperability um and

789
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,919
specifically

790
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,679
it's it's both the lack of a

791
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,279
standardized interoperable means of

792
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,200
connecting to these services which

793
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,559
uh you know to its credit twitter is

794
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,520
actually like trying to do something

795
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,080
about twitter's

796
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,679
project blue sky i think they they've

797
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,480
like they've sat down and they've gone

798
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,480
like well

799
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,279
having a you know absolute control over

800
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,039
our users is worth this much

801
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,200
not being responsible for moderating

802
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,799
content is worth this much

803
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,720
the only way we get out from not

804
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,240
moderating content is by not owning the

805
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,679
content not having the capacity to

806
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,919
monitor moderate the content

807
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,600
and just being like a federator you know

808
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,880
a central node and a federator

809
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,039
and so they're they're kind of moving

810
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,720
towards it and they they want to provide

811
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,320
like a managed interface right they want

812
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,240
to have like um uh

813
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,600
you know a standardized api that

814
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,440
everyone accesses the problem with those

815
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,639
standardized apis is that twitter used

816
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,360
to have them and then they took them

817
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,320
away

818
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,918
so you know the the thing that produces

819
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,600
an equilibrium

820
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,440
where those standardized apis are both

821
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,320
good and durable

822
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,760
is competitive compatibility if you know

823
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,520
that the day you withdraw the

824
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,960
standardized api

825
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,679
hackers all over the world are going to

826
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,120
write bots that just replace the api

827
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,880
with scrapers

828
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,959
that you're gonna have to fight like

829
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,720
this it's it's like it's like marching

830
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,799
on stalingrad right like you're just

831
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,840
gonna have like this kind of endless

832
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,720
grinding trench warfare with with

833
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:08,480
hackers who will be legally immunized

834
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,919
from your uh from from any legal tool

835
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,120
you have to shut them down and all

836
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,400
you'll be able to do

837
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,719
is just tweak intrusion detection system

838
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,240
rules and try you know an assistant with

839
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,720
hundreds of millions of users

840
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,279
to distinguish users who are just weird

841
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,679
from

842
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,799
bots right because like when you have

843
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,880
like think about facebook right

844
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,440
facebook's got 2.6 billion users

845
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,840
it has 2.6 million one in a million use

846
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,480
cases or 2.6 000 one in a million use

847
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,279
cases

848
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,279
every single day right so distinguishing

849
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,760
the dolphins from the tuna in your tuna

850
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,440
net

851
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,039
is going to be really hard when you're

852
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,120
operating at that scale

853
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,960
and so you know when you when you're

854
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,120
like in the meeting with the head of you

855
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,960
know the cto and the cso and the chief

856
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,080
marketing officer and the cfo and the

857
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,600
and you know the shareholders in the

858
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,120
board and they're like we need more

859
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,199
revenue we're going to shut down the api

860
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,520
we're going to nerf the api

861
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,960
the technologists in the room can say

862
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,639
this is what the bill for that is going

863
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,320
to look like and it's going to exceed

864
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,520
the excess capital we get

865
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,279
from blocking the api and so you know

866
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,520
this idea that like

867
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,640
we can just like all of us decide that

868
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,080
next wednesday

869
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,640
we're gonna shut down our twitter

870
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,879
accounts and reopen them on mastodon

871
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,000
it's crazy it's not how technology has

872
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,799
ever worked right

873
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,480
the way that we got keynote as like a

874
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,320
standard for a lot of people's

875
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,600
powerpoint presentations or you know uh

876
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,080
conference presentations

877
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,600
was not by everyone saying like on on

878
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,960
thursday the 21st

879
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,120
we stopped using powerpoint we started

880
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,799
using keynote it was by iwork suite

881
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,600
being able to read and write powerpoint

882
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,840
files

883
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,360
and by having this kind of this this

884
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,520
kind of protracted period

885
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,559
where it was non but not binary right

886
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,000
like you could have one foot and one

887
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,039
camp one foot in the other

888
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,039
you know i analogize it sometimes to um

889
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,480
you know my family's migration history

890
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,520
where my grandmother was a soviet

891
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,840
refugee

892
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,600
she came to canada and she lost touch

893
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,158
with her family for 15 years

894
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,439
right she couldn't uh phone them she

895
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,440
couldn't write to them

896
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,679
like they exchanged messages sometimes

897
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,360
if someone got a visa to go to leningrad

898
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,440
she would tell them what to tell her

899
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,678
mother if they could find her mother

900
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,799
and and you know obviously like leaving

901
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,200
the soviet union was

902
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,158
really hard for my family it was a

903
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,000
really hard choice

904
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,240
even though canada was a better place to

905
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,600
be for them because of the very high

906
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,200
cost that came with it

907
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,639
and they had family members i have

908
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,600
family members in st petersburg who

909
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,080
never came

910
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,918
because the cost was too high so five

911
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,840
years ago i left london and moved to los

912
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,120
angeles and here i am in my office in

913
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,279
los angeles not only

914
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,479
did all of my books come with me but let

915
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,000
me see if i can get it in the frame over

916
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,760
there is my theremin

917
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,600
okay that's the theremin that i bought

918
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,679
that runs on british voltage

919
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,600
that has a little mains adapter we just

920
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,960
got off a zoom call with my relatives in

921
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,080
london and we talked to my family in

922
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,399
canada every week

923
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,360
so for us the switching costs were

924
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,639
really low

925
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,158
because if we changed our mind we could

926
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,159
go back and in fact this is the third

927
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,159
time i've moved to los angeles

928
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,840
right so i could i could try los angeles

929
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,240
see how it worked go back to london

930
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,879
come back it was expensive right but it

931
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,799
wasn't

932
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,320
leaving the soviet union in the 40s

933
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:07,200
expensive and so

934
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,879
you know by all means build the place

935
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,440
that people who want to escape

936
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,640
mark zuckerberg's iron curtain will find

937
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,320
as a happy home

938
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,159
but give them the ability to have one

939
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,080
foot in one one foot in the other

940
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,520
and you know the other piece of this is

941
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,480
every time zuckerberg says

942
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,679
oh i'm blocking interop tools to keep my

943
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,080
users safe

944
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,320
remember that in the ddr they said the

945
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,960
berlin wall isn't to keep east germans

946
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,720
in

947
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,240
it's to keep west germans out of the

948
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,559
workers paradise

949
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:41,200
and it's the same excuse

950
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:44,960
it always is i just got a

951
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,120
message here and probably an interesting

952
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,840
question by the way

953
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,840
or actually two linking together

954
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:59,039
coming back to the monopolies you

955
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,559
did not say much about amazon on your

956
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,600
talk before

957
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,678
and we have another question

958
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,120
for the fireside chat here with your

959
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,480
book

960
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,760
the person asked you

961
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:17,039
actually went away from publishing

962
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:20,640
under cc licenses and went

963
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:24,320
to bigger publishing houses um

964
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,720
would you like to uh explain probably

965
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,080
also the amazon part then i didn't work

966
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,679
amazon in just because of

967
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,519
time pressure but um all of this stuff

968
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,279
applies to amazon i mean i think the

969
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,000
most interesting thing about amazon

970
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,880
uh is in terms of its worker uprising

971
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,640
where

972
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,039
there's been an explicit so remember

973
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,320
that all tech companies are split into

974
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,519
some of the highest paid workers on

975
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,639
earth and some of the lowest paid

976
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,240
workers on earth

977
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,679
right and so in amazon's case that's

978
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,279
like the warehouse workers who have some

979
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,000
of the worst working conditions and so

980
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,200
on

981
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,600
and explicitly the tech worker uprising

982
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,039
in amazon was in solidarity with the

983
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,799
warehouse workers

984
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,399
and uh that's really interesting right

985
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,840
because it's you know crossing these

986
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,799
class boundaries and it's

987
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,559
crossing these divisions that the firms

988
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,399
themselves deliberately created to

989
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,320
prevent solidarity

990
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,760
uh you know in the same way that in the

991
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,439
early days of the trade union movement

992
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,679
in the u.s

993
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,200
if the italian auto workers were on

994
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,720
strike they'd bring in german auto

995
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,840
workers to break the strike

996
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,559
and they would try to make it about

997
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,158
germans and italians not workers

998
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,158
in the same way you have this kind of

999
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,919
that you divide up the workplace

1000
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,600
into contractors and non-contractors

1001
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,480
green badges and blue badges

1002
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,760
and it it uh works to drive a fracture

1003
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,760
line between

1004
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,879
uh different people actually have shared

1005
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,200
interests

1006
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,320
um in terms of publishing well it's

1007
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,000
about monopolies there's

1008
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,439
five publishers left and in fact there's

1009
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,960
about to be four because bertelsmann is

1010
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,880
buying simon schuster

1011
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,399
assuming the doj lets them do it which

1012
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,440
you know this is kind of like the first

1013
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,639
litmus test

1014
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,440
of whether biden's doj has got

1015
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,080
like any real serious commitment to

1016
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,159
blocking

1017
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,120
monopolistic mergers because the idea

1018
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,240
that we should go from

1019
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,600
five companies to four in publishing is

1020
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,120
outrageous there's just

1021
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,480
no reason for it so uh the

1022
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,719
you know with five publishers there's

1023
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:14,000
exactly one that lets me go drm free

1024
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,000
and that's tor and tor

1025
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,679
was also the only one that would let me

1026
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,760
go uh

1027
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,880
creative commons and they changed their

1028
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,120
mind

1029
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,559
and so the choice was try and

1030
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,439
self-publish which

1031
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,639
frankly like i've done it it's hard work

1032
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,399
i would get

1033
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,240
one tenth as many books written and i

1034
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,399
would go to my death bed

1035
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,840
with dozens of unwritten books but a

1036
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:40,639
better creative commons track record

1037
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,720
or suck it up and i sucked it up i don't

1038
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,279
like it and they know i don't like it

1039
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,240
uh i like tor they're the uh you know

1040
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,840
smallest

1041
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,080
most they're owned by mcmillan which is

1042
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,279
owned by von holtz frank uh

1043
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,519
and you know they're they're the

1044
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,519
smallest they're the most ethical

1045
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,760
they're you know the ones that i like

1046
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,360
the best but um

1047
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,879
they didn't like the creative commons

1048
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,399
licenses in the end and so

1049
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,880
that was where i ended up it sucks

1050
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,840
now you know i can still cc license the

1051
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,040
other stuff that i do

1052
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,719
and if anything i've become more

1053
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,520
permissive than that i know i left boing

1054
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,918
boing

1055
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,359
almost a year ago a year minus a week

1056
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,239
and a half ago

1057
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,839
and uh when i left i started this new

1058
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,759
thing called pluralistic and boing boing

1059
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,359
was licensed under a very restrictive cc

1060
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,760
license

1061
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:28,159
this is ccbi it's as close as you get to

1062
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,399
public domain without going cc0

1063
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,159
it just requires attribution and so

1064
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,520
pluralistic is a pretty significant

1065
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,879
piece of writing i

1066
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,719
you know i've taken a break from it this

1067
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,719
week but i write

1068
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,239
three or four substantial articles every

1069
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,279
day that are cc0

1070
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:45,439
or cc by uh and that i think

1071
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,679
like you know if you're interested in my

1072
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,520
work like there's a lot of it out there

1073
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,440
under extremely generous far more

1074
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,359
generous than my novels cc licenses i

1075
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,359
wish i could do the cc licenses too

1076
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,719
i mean if nothing else i mean this is a

1077
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,319
little inside

1078
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,560
baseball but given that it's a german

1079
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,040
audience and it's relevant to germany

1080
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,759
so the germans that i meet who've read

1081
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,680
little brother

1082
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,440
and my other books inevitably found them

1083
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,000
through creative commons licenses

1084
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,599
uh in part i think because english works

1085
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,440
in germany are still pretty expensive

1086
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,280
relative to the german translations

1087
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,800
and germans have a high enough literacy

1088
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,800
in english that they like to read

1089
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,720
original english texts and so before

1090
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,880
there were ebook markets

1091
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,480
uh that served germany with english

1092
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,320
language text the only way to get an

1093
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,160
english language ebook was to pirate it

1094
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,720
or get a cc one and mine was the only cc

1095
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,799
one

1096
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,399
so what's interesting about that is now

1097
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,079
thanks to tour books

1098
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,599
i'm able to run my own ebook store if

1099
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,640
you go to crafthound.com

1100
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,640
shop i have an ebook store it's drm free

1101
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,400
eula free books and the way the

1102
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,440
publishing contracts work is my british

1103
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,920
publisher

1104
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,760
has rights in british territories except

1105
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,440
canada like former former british empire

1106
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,320
territories except canada india

1107
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,440
australia

1108
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,440
canada new zealand

1109
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,599
the uk and so on and my american

1110
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,879
publisher

1111
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,640
has rights in the us and canada

1112
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,160
and then nobody has the exclusive right

1113
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,759
to non-english-speaking

1114
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,560
territories like germany and about 10 to

1115
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,079
15

1116
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,680
of my e-book sales come from germany and

1117
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,160
i get all the money from those

1118
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,879
right when i sell an ebook in the uk i

1119
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,560
give 70

1120
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,960
of the money to my publisher and then

1121
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,400
they give me 25 back as my royalty when

1122
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,720
i sell a book in the u.s

1123
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,599
i give 70 to my u.s publisher and they

1124
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,078
give me back

1125
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,960
25 as my royalty when i sell a book in

1126
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,800
germany

1127
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,000
i keep all of it i get twice as much

1128
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,880
money and so

1129
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,240
10 to 15 of my readership are in germany

1130
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,960
and they account for 30

1131
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,439
of my gross receipts from the website uh

1132
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,160
and so

1133
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,000
that is like super cool and you know i

1134
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,279
understand that my publisher is not

1135
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,480
neither here nor there on that one

1136
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,079
because they don't get a dime from it

1137
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,920
but for me

1138
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,920
my german audience is super important my

1139
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,160
german english speaking audience

1140
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:59,839
is super important and i would have

1141
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:03,200
um self-publishing uh ever being

1142
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:08,400
um a way for you um in in the

1143
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:09,598
in the larger scale so like um joanna

1144
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,680
penn is doing

1145
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:16,960
in uh in uk it's just a lot of work

1146
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,000
i mean it is like like i i work at 16 to

1147
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,880
18 hour day

1148
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,880
most days like i the the so writing

1149
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,920
pluralistic doing eff and working on

1150
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,560
novels

1151
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,960
during the crisis the first day i took

1152
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,440
off between march 19th

1153
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,200
uh after march 19th was december the

1154
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,040
17th

1155
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,240
so i didn't have a weekend off i didn't

1156
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,640
have a day off

1157
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,160
so and i wrote a book i wrote a book

1158
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,400
during the crisis and i self-published

1159
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,680
an

1160
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:47,119
audiobook and i had four books come out

1161
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:50,640
and um you know i

1162
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,680
if if i were doing more

1163
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,839
if i were doing the stuff that my

1164
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,040
publisher does i wouldn't have written

1165
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,480
that book i would have written maybe

1166
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,720
half that book

1167
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,320
and so it's it's just a matter of how

1168
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,480
much time i have

1169
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,240
uh and you know i have done an

1170
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,680
experiment i did a self-published shirt

1171
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,078
story collection it made a bunch of

1172
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,839
money

1173
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,040
like relative to how short story short

1174
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,400
story collections don't make a lot of

1175
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,720
money usually so it made about three

1176
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,200
times as much four times as much

1177
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,720
but the amount of the actual like gross

1178
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,399
dollars that it made

1179
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,319
was significantly less than i would get

1180
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,440
for going through a publisher

1181
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,920
and you know the the

1182
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,680
you know the the amount of extra work

1183
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,560
was a novel's worth of work

1184
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,640
and so i just you know back to like what

1185
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,359
i want to be worried about on my

1186
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,560
deathbed

1187
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:38,319
and i would much rather have

1188
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,240
published all of these books without

1189
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,920
eulos without drm

1190
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:47,598
uh and um you know

1191
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,800
argued for a more robust set of fair

1192
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,240
dealing and fair use

1193
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,400
rules that would allow people to use

1194
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,078
them widely than having written half as

1195
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,680
many books but gotten them all out under

1196
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:00,480
cc to a much smaller audience

1197
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,520
yeah it's a yeah it's not i mean i'm not

1198
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,920
thrilled about it

1199
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,960
it's it's like and maybe it's the wrong

1200
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,599
call i don't know

1201
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,040
uh but it's like you know it's the call

1202
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,560
i made for now

1203
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,480
you know if we see massive demon

1204
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,720
monopolization maybe maybe it'll get

1205
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,000
easier

1206
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:21,200
um i see in the chat uh we do

1207
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,680
have a question so do we want to try to

1208
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,040
have someone free their microphone

1209
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:30,160
and ask the question here in the room

1210
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,200
i think i'm now unmuted yes yeah hi

1211
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,440
corey um

1212
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,040
just a quick question so as readers is

1213
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,800
there anything we can do about this it

1214
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,759
seems like the business of publishing is

1215
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,599
pretty

1216
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,240
in let's say a bit of a difficult

1217
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,240
situation is there anything we can do

1218
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,799
yeah i mean i think this is the problem

1219
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,200
with uh consumerism more broadly

1220
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,880
is that you know consumerism the value

1221
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,078
of consumer rights movements

1222
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,839
and there are some very well you know

1223
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,000
eff has its origins and consumer rights

1224
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,400
groups like buick and edri are

1225
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,079
fundamentally consumer rights groups the

1226
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,240
value of them is they work fast right

1227
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,200
like consumer consumer power is fast

1228
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,200
power

1229
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:10,799
but it's limited power and

1230
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:14,160
you know citizen power is slow

1231
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,880
uh but consumers can't by definition

1232
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,160
can't shop their way out of a monopoly

1233
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,839
right like the

1234
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,240
making better consumer choices making

1235
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,960
better individual choices

1236
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,640
will not solve monopolism because the

1237
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,240
whole point of monopolism

1238
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,000
is that the meaningful choices have been

1239
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,560
taken off the table that's that that's

1240
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,400
the

1241
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,880
the real problem of monopolism is the

1242
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,319
way that it distorts our public policy

1243
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,000
and so for that you need to be involved

1244
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,160
in democracy and

1245
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,240
so to be involved into democracy is to

1246
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,598
not con think of yourself

1247
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,479
uh primarily as an actor whose uh

1248
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,000
voice is felt through purchase decisions

1249
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,720
but rather through

1250
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,400
someone who's part of a movement and you

1251
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,520
know the good news is

1252
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,720
that um there's a wide political

1253
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,000
spectrum

1254
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,680
of um mainstream political movements

1255
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,560
that are concerned with monopoly right

1256
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,480
now

1257
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,480
uh and it's not you know the exclusive

1258
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,440
purview of the left i mean the right

1259
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,319
for a long time were universally

1260
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,839
cheerleaders

1261
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:18,000
for monopoly but increasingly you know

1262
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,359
they're they're like they were like well

1263
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,280
i was fine when facebook was

1264
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:23,040
de-platforming you know anti-pipeline

1265
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,040
activists and trans rights activists but

1266
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,599
now that alex jones is gone

1267
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,040
i'm i'm you know i where where where

1268
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,040
will afd meet

1269
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,040
if not on facebook and so now suddenly

1270
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,119
they're all worried about monopoly

1271
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,960
and you know the risk is that they will

1272
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,160
structure their anti-monopoly remedies

1273
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,520
in ways that actually just make the

1274
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,720
monopoly stronger

1275
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:48,000
the big one of those is is arguing for

1276
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,799
uh more intense

1277
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,560
more fine-grained accountability for

1278
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,480
moderation decisions

1279
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,078
and the thing about that is the reason

1280
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,720
that facebook makes bad moderation

1281
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,839
decisions

1282
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,680
is not merely because mark zuckerberg

1283
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,680
is not well suited to being in charge of

1284
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,440
the lives of 2.6 billion people

1285
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,960
it's because like no one on earth should

1286
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,200
have that job

1287
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,359
and if we say all right you've got to

1288
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,640
moderate all the bad stuff or moderate

1289
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,240
better or not have two

1290
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,078
more false positives or whatever stop

1291
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,959
harassment or anything else

1292
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,400
all we do is we create this like floor

1293
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,880
underneath which

1294
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,400
no one can afford to participate as an

1295
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,920
alternative to facebook

1296
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,400
and that just makes facebook the endless

1297
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,280
monopoly and i fear that both the right

1298
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,760
and the left

1299
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,839
for their own reasons are in their

1300
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,920
anti-monopoly energy

1301
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,359
going down the wrong path here and so

1302
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,760
this is where we need people

1303
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:41,440
in movements who are technologists and

1304
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,599
understand the technology

1305
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,560
and can say in the same way that we've

1306
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,040
said now for

1307
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:49,040
for decades whenever you know someone

1308
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,960
says oh well we need to get rid of

1309
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,640
uh cryptography and replace it with

1310
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,880
cryptography with lawful access

1311
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,960
backdoors and that will only let the bad

1312
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,400
guys uh that will only let the good guys

1313
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,280
in and won't let the bad guys and we say

1314
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,599
to them look

1315
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,440
you know i am here as your constituent

1316
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,079
as a technologist as someone who works

1317
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,920
in the field

1318
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,920
and i'm going to explain to you what's

1319
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,280
at risk and why that doesn't work

1320
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,560
you know in words that you can

1321
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,160
understand we need to go in and have

1322
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,720
those same conversations

1323
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,480
about moderation and about and about

1324
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,598
this idea that like

1325
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:22,160
it's not too late for a dynamic internet

1326
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,440
that that we can we can aspire to

1327
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,118
something better

1328
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,680
than a slightly more responsible

1329
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,839
facebook that we can aspire to

1330
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,960
a more self-determining more pluralistic

1331
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,880
internet

1332
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,560
where you don't have to hope that

1333
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,200
facebook cleans up its act

1334
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,119
you can just go somewhere else whose

1335
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,879
policies you like better

1336
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,880
and still talk to your facebook friends

1337
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,880
and um as you just saw activists and all

1338
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,480
the bad stuff

1339
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,800
we have some more questions here um

1340
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,319
you also said something about that

1341
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:59,920
dividing and fracture line before

1342
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:03,040
where workers were were divided and

1343
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:06,480
i have a question um

1344
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:09,599
why do all those or both

1345
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:14,000
many left-wing communities

1346
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:16,640
split up about fundamental discussions

1347
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,359
while right-wing people just stick

1348
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,799
together

1349
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:24,319
and uh yeah trying to

1350
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,760
to work together for benefits

1351
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,520
well i think that i mean it's it's

1352
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,440
multifaceted and that characterization

1353
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,160
is not entirely true right

1354
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,240
you know the right wing movements do

1355
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,720
have really serious fracture lines uh

1356
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,078
you know i

1357
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,839
in canada our conservative party uh

1358
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,079
was like many conservative parties one

1359
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:43,440
of these chimeras where you have um

1360
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,440
you know wealthy people and social

1361
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,359
conservatives and the

1362
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,040
wealthy people say you know vote for our

1363
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,240
tax breaks and we'll punish women who

1364
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,000
have abortions

1365
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,000
and they they fuse you know this this

1366
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,079
coalition and in canada

1367
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,760
uh after the mulroney years he was our

1368
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,720
he was our you know helmet coal

1369
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,200
equivalent

1370
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,078
uh the conservatives were in such bad

1371
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,160
odor

1372
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,400
that they pulled less than 12 in the

1373
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,000
election didn't qualify for free office

1374
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,560
based on parliament hill

1375
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,920
and and the party broke up uh and became

1376
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,200
two parties the conservative party and

1377
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,839
the reform party

1378
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,960
and hilariously later on they um they

1379
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,480
reformed

1380
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,560
and they there was at this party

1381
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,640
all-party conference and the

1382
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,520
naming committee went into a closed room

1383
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,720
to figure out what they were going to

1384
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,000
call the new party

1385
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,160
and they came up with the canadian

1386
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,280
conservative reform alliance party

1387
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,598
which is crap and no one noticed until

1388
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,160
after the press release

1389
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,520
but conservative parties fracture all

1390
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,520
the time they have they have

1391
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,800
really serious grotesque fracture lines

1392
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,720
the republican party is

1393
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,480
is in major disarray at the moment and

1394
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,200
will probably be in worst disarray after

1395
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,160
the election

1396
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,839
uh the the run-up and uh the runoff in

1397
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,000
in georgia in january if they lose

1398
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,440
control of the the senate because you

1399
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,720
know money talks and walks if

1400
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,240
you don't deliver if your program

1401
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,000
doesn't deliver the majority

1402
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,319
that allows you to enact your your the

1403
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,560
wider program then you are discredited

1404
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:04,160
and you lose your you lose your seat i

1405
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,520
mean the british tories have undergone

1406
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,000
the same thing that's what brexit was it

1407
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,079
was a

1408
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,760
split in the british tories in terms of

1409
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,520
the left there are lots of reasons the

1410
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,119
left splinters some of it is

1411
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,200
what freud called the narcissism of

1412
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,119
small differences you know you call free

1413
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,919
software i call it open source

1414
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,560
we can't be friends anymore um some of

1415
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,920
it

1416
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:26,720
uh is legitimate differences uh

1417
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,400
which you know there there are real

1418
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,839
meaningful differences be between say

1419
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,760
liberals and the left

1420
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:34,240
uh and there are lots of places where

1421
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,760
they agree but there are irreconcilable

1422
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,759
differences and when it comes to those

1423
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,359
breaking points

1424
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,440
you just the alliance is going to fall

1425
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:44,160
apart right it may it may and

1426
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,200
personal friendships may endure but the

1427
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,440
wider questions

1428
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,680
are are going to drive it apart and then

1429
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,960
i just watched a video with boots riley

1430
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,319
who you know he's um uh the guy who made

1431
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,440
uh sorry to disturb you

1432
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,560
he's a revolutionary rapper and he

1433
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,240
talked about the

1434
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:03,119
history of the protest movement in the

1435
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,479
u.s and the trade union movement

1436
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,560
and one thing that is really under

1437
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,200
reported including to my shame by me in

1438
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,040
the last

1439
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,319
nine months is that the us had more

1440
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,560
wildcat strikes

1441
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,240
than at any time since the 1940s uh

1442
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,680
strikes where there wasn't a union that

1443
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,240
it was unsanctioned

1444
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,040
and they were um in support of the same

1445
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,479
issues

1446
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,920
as the protests that got all the

1447
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:27,200
coverage black lives matter and so on

1448
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:30,480
but they didn't draw the coverage and

1449
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:33,279
riley was on the show talking about the

1450
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,200
the way that the left including the

1451
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,319
radical left in the u.s

1452
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:40,240
moved from strikes to protests

1453
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:41,759
where the the primary the primary

1454
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,160
mechanism for enacting a program of

1455
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,280
change was was protests and not strikes

1456
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,598
and he said that it came from the

1457
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,880
anti-communist witch hunts of the 1950s

1458
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:52,000
and 60s

1459
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:55,599
and that the trade union movement to

1460
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,400
uh avoid the penalty of being tarred as

1461
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,720
communists

1462
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,760
by the witch hunters by the mccarthy

1463
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,000
hearings

1464
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,280
they um backed away from radical

1465
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,200
political agendas

1466
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,480
and they became effectively part of the

1467
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,759
establishment

1468
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:12,720
and that the radical left split off

1469
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,520
and they declared that student movements

1470
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:17,359
were the

1471
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:18,720
future of of political radical political

1472
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,558
change

1473
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,480
and student movements they can have

1474
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,359
symbolic strikes but a student strike is

1475
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,839
not a strike

1476
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,960
in the way that uh worker strike is

1477
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,799
right a worker strike is really

1478
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,400
fundamental like at its core a worker

1479
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:34,400
strike is the argument

1480
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,280
that who gets to decide how things get

1481
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,839
made

1482
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,920
and who gets to own those things should

1483
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,119
be in a different set of hands should be

1484
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,559
differently organized

1485
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:48,000
it is a a a foundationally

1486
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:50,480
different project than a protest

1487
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,160
a protest is about what the people in

1488
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,920
charge should do

1489
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,200
and a strike is about who should be in

1490
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,800
charge

1491
00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:00,319
and uh he says that the legacy of that

1492
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,680
today

1493
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:05,759
is that we focus our energies on the

1494
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,359
outcomes of our political arrangements

1495
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,680
which are structural racism

1496
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:14,000
sexism uh you know inequality and so on

1497
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,839
but we don't talk about the underlying

1498
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,960
structure anymore we don't address the

1499
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,880
underlying structure

1500
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,160
we may talk about it in our protest but

1501
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,760
we don't address it with the

1502
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:26,640
with the most uh tried and true direct

1503
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,000
action tool we have for changing those

1504
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,520
structural arrangements which is

1505
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,200
striking

1506
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,240
and i you know i just listened to that

1507
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,598
yesterday and i've been thinking about

1508
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,399
it ever since

1509
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,599
and i think that it does reveal a really

1510
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,440
like

1511
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,040
non-trivial distinction between

1512
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,680
different ways of looking

1513
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,279
at theories of change and it's not that

1514
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,598
kind of cartoony like

1515
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,960
marxists care about class and everyone

1516
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,720
else and they're all white dudes and

1517
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,920
then everyone else cares about gender

1518
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:56,799
and race it's about understanding

1519
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,800
how uh anti-communist witch hunts and

1520
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,880
how like a deliberate like

1521
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,720
normative and political project to

1522
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,400
discredit a certain kind of a certain

1523
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,200
ideology

1524
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,680
changed the way that we talk about what

1525
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:12,240
our political aspirations might be

1526
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,279
and uh it's a really important

1527
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,279
distinction it i

1528
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,640
it really matters i'm still trying to

1529
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,480
digest it but

1530
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,799
uh you know i'm thinking about it ever

1531
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,800
since

1532
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:27,520
um we have uh

1533
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,359
as we as we said just uh before uh we

1534
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,599
went uh online with the

1535
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,799
uh with the fireside chat here by the

1536
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,680
way um

1537
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,720
and i'm really happy that we're um

1538
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,319
exploring this

1539
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:44,000
uh yeah probably for us a new

1540
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:46,480
uh format of uh of a talk of the chat

1541
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
um i'm really happy to have people here

1542
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,880
uh in the room with us

1543
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,319
so um this uh will be uh for all the

1544
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,040
other fireside chat

1545
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:56,000
another invitation to hop in and ask

1546
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,920
your questions

1547
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:03,040
directly and be here with us

1548
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:06,559
in the room and

1549
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,960
we have people in the audience who have

1550
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,839
a really big question that probably all

1551
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,119
of us

1552
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:17,839
have um

1553
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:20,960
it's 2020 for all of us and 2020 is

1554
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:25,359
somewhat demanding

1555
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:28,880
and how do you manage

1556
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:32,000
to not get depressive

1557
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:35,680
over activism so how can you stay

1558
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,720
positive with all this stuff happening

1559
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:41,919
and all the opponents we face

1560
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:44,399
in activism yeah you know

1561
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,800
i would lie if i said i hadn't felt a

1562
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,599
lot of despair this year

1563
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,760
i mean you know lucky for me the way

1564
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:55,040
that i cope with stress is by working

1565
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:58,319
so you know it's not entirely great

1566
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:01,359
because when i work without

1567
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:02,720
uh balance you know when all you do is

1568
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:03,440
stick your face in your computer and

1569
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,319
work

1570
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,760
then your emotional health suffers and

1571
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:08,960
your physical health i have a chronic

1572
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,800
pain problem and i

1573
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,160
hurt myself so badly a couple of weeks

1574
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,280
ago that i was actually walking around

1575
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,359
in a cane

1576
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,040
literally just from sitting too much and

1577
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,960
neglecting my physical

1578
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,960
welfare not doing the self-care that i

1579
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:24,079
need to manage my disability

1580
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,559
so you know it's it's um it's not been

1581
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:27,440
great

1582
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:29,040
for anyone i you know i'm working on

1583
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,240
this utopian novel right now

1584
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,119
uh the lost cause which is uh a novel

1585
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,319
set after

1586
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:39,520
a green new deal in which

1587
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:42,960
um people have oriented themselves

1588
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,240
to the long project of dealing with

1589
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,920
climate change

1590
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,839
and so that includes things like a

1591
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,400
300-year project to relocate all the

1592
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:53,359
world's cities 20 kilometers inland

1593
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,880
and really big structural changes to

1594
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:57,759
cope with hundreds of millions

1595
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,599
of refugees that we know will come and

1596
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,559
orienting our work

1597
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,760
around contingency plans for months at a

1598
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,400
time when you can't leave your house

1599
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,839
because of wildfires

1600
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:12,000
and and it is indistinguishable from an

1601
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:14,319
environmental dystopian novel

1602
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,559
except for the fact that the people in

1603
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:18,240
the book don't feel helpless

1604
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,319
they know it's coming they know they

1605
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,000
can't stop it but they know that they

1606
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:25,359
can prepare for it they can do

1607
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,240
stuff that will manage it and so for me

1608
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,000
that's like

1609
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,160
you know back to the theme of my mother

1610
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,680
talk i just gave self-determination

1611
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:35,200
right the ability to have like a

1612
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:38,720
say in how this stuff works out

1613
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:42,720
to know which parts are parameterized

1614
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:45,040
and which parts are set in stone that is

1615
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,399
i think the thing that that keeps at

1616
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,520
least some people

1617
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,359
saying and dedicated and acting and so

1618
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,200
this is you know the upside of activism

1619
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:55,759
right is like doing something to try and

1620
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,319
make a difference

1621
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,559
feel hopeless and exhausting but try

1622
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:03,200
doing nothing to make a difference

1623
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,000
and to just be like you know tempest

1624
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,759
tossed

1625
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:10,880
smashed around by the by the breaking

1626
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:14,160
down system that's for me anyway

1627
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:17,280
much much harder more stressful

1628
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,160
and you know ultimately like my view of

1629
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,599
the world

1630
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:23,680
is that um we cannot

1631
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,359
operate a theory of change like a

1632
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,040
novelist we have to operate a theory

1633
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:30,400
change like a programmer

1634
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:33,759
so novelists you know posit this like

1635
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,200
reductionist simplified way of getting

1636
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,559
from a to zed

1637
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,000
where you have an ending you have a

1638
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:39,359
beginning and you work out the steps to

1639
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,920
take you up a dramatic curve and then

1640
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,880
down and

1641
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,160
and through your dna mall right and

1642
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,839
programmers

1643
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,759
when they work with like non-trivial

1644
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:51,040
data sets they know

1645
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:53,920
that the uh terrain

1646
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,839
is unknowably complex that if you try to

1647
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,440
enumerate the whole terrain and find an

1648
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:59,759
optimal path through it

1649
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,119
that you would uh the train would have

1650
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,680
like altered

1651
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,200
by the time you'd finished and also the

1652
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,000
moment during which you want to do the

1653
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,118
job

1654
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,960
would have passed so you can't

1655
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,400
figure out how to get from a to z if

1656
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,160
you're writing code

1657
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,000
uh that you can't find the optimal way

1658
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,759
the one true way the best way

1659
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,079
instead what you have to do is he'll

1660
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,280
climb right you have to like ascend a

1661
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,640
gradient

1662
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,000
towards a better future a

1663
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,520
like the victory condition you're

1664
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,040
looking for and you might end up stuck

1665
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,319
in a local maximum

1666
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,759
you might have to do some like hill

1667
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,558
descent in order to do more hill

1668
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,599
climbing

1669
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:36,960
but in order to get from from a to z and

1670
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:39,359
software

1671
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,480
you assume that if you can ascend the

1672
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:44,160
gradient

1673
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:47,280
to a new area of the terrain

1674
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,480
that from that new area new terrain will

1675
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,240
be revealed

1676
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,640
that you can't see from where you are

1677
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,640
now and that the best way to map the

1678
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,799
territory is to traverse it

1679
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,319
and that even if you have some reversals

1680
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:00,160
even if you have to double back on

1681
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:04,000
yourself to get all the way through it

1682
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:06,640
you will still have done a better job

1683
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,799
than if you had tried to do it perfectly

1684
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,839
all at once the way a novelist does

1685
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:14,319
and so whenever things look shitty and

1686
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:16,480
scary i just say like if i can think of

1687
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:19,279
one thing that i can do

1688
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,960
that improves my situation that i will

1689
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:24,319
find myself

1690
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,920
in a new zone from which i might have

1691
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,359
new courses of action that i can't even

1692
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,119
imagine now

1693
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:30,799
and that's what keeps me going it may

1694
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,319
not make me happy but it

1695
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:33,920
it's a reason to put one foot in front

1696
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:37,119
of the other

1697
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:40,319
yeah i think we all need that

1698
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:43,440
um we do have two more questions in the

1699
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:47,359
chat or two and a half and we have like

1700
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:51,760
three minutes left so can we can we get

1701
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:54,400
two short ones probably uh eon

1702
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,400
first of them

1703
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:01,440
hi corey corey thanks for your work

1704
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,520
amazing i love it so much and i read all

1705
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:07,599
of it whenever you publish something new

1706
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,599
um i want to ask about the book

1707
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,960
for the win and i love that much and

1708
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,440
it showed the world that games are

1709
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,440
actually a market a big financial market

1710
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:19,520
and the environment the setting of the

1711
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,200
scene uh it feels a bit like there could

1712
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,920
be more stuff happening and the end of

1713
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,680
the book

1714
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,960
felt a bit open i don't want to spoil it

1715
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,839
to anyone but

1716
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,680
it felt a bit like there could be more

1717
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,558
what would it take for you to write a

1718
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,440
sequel to

1719
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:34,640
for the win well you know i wrote for

1720
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,559
the win when i was

1721
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,680
as part of my reckoning with a great

1722
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,720
financial crisis

1723
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:42,480
and also as part of

1724
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,480
my marriage because i'm married to a

1725
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:48,079
former professional quake player

1726
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:49,440
uh and so i i she was at gdc when the

1727
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:51,839
first gold farmer

1728
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,799
uh came forward and so gold farming was

1729
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:53,599
like a thing that i was really

1730
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,880
interested in

1731
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:56,880
i was really interested in the

1732
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,520
burgeoning you know games economics

1733
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,640
world

1734
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:02,960
janus varfakas working for uh um that

1735
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,759
icelandic game company and so on

1736
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:08,079
um but i today i'm far more interested

1737
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:11,440
in heterodox economics and particularly

1738
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:12,960
in modern monetary theory and uh

1739
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,319
i think that if i were ever to revisit

1740
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,040
this i don't know that i would but it

1741
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,880
would be

1742
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,960
what would be a really interesting way

1743
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,839
to revisit this would be to do an mmt

1744
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,880
lens

1745
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:23,680
uh gold farming novel yes please this

1746
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,680
sounds great

1747
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:29,118
please okay so we see a next novel

1748
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,839
coming up there

1749
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:34,240
and we have one last question from cage

1750
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:34,240
please

1751
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:38,240
hi corey thank you uh for the talk

1752
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,799
really uh uh really great to have you

1753
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,439
here

1754
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:42,960
um so given everything that you've said

1755
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,640
about monopolies uh

1756
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,319
massive unchecked corporate power and so

1757
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:49,598
forth what is

1758
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:51,200
one realistic thing that we could all do

1759
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:52,799
to combat this that would actually have

1760
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,640
a significant impact

1761
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,559
and i actually have a second quick

1762
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:59,759
follow-up on that what's one thing that

1763
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:02,160
truly brings you hope in all of this

1764
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,839
well so the the one realistic thing is

1765
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,359
you can't do anything individually you

1766
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:06,480
have to do it collectively right so you

1767
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:08,240
have to find

1768
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,680
a political movement and this is this is

1769
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,040
my point about the right and the left

1770
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,240
and and different kinds of parties and

1771
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,880
so on you have to find a political

1772
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,399
movement

1773
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,079
that is orienting itself towards

1774
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,000
monopoly uh

1775
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:19,440
and and towards dealing with monopoly

1776
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,720
you know that our

1777
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:24,319
our policymakers are even the ones that

1778
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,839
perceive a problem with monopoly don't

1779
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:26,960
perceive the political will to do

1780
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:28,960
anything about it yet

1781
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:31,200
you know i debated uh veshdagger from

1782
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:34,799
the audience last year at reboot

1783
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,279
uh and uh in in or not reboot republica

1784
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:38,000
in

1785
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,839
in berlin and she was like oh we can't

1786
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,880
do breakups they take 15 years and cost

1787
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:44,558
too much money

1788
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:47,119
she needs to to have political

1789
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:47,920
and social movements who have her back

1790
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:49,839
who say

1791
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,520
15 years to break up facebook sounds

1792
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:53,920
good to me let's spend the money

1793
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,880
right and to get there it's not an

1794
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,799
individual

1795
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,720
thing it's a it's a social thing you

1796
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,720
know it's it's being involved in a

1797
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,359
a political party in a political

1798
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,200
movement that is that is engaged with us

1799
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:07,040
you know larry lessig talks about the

1800
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,240
world being regulated by code norms

1801
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,920
markets and law

1802
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,279
right so you know you can have this

1803
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,760
normative discussion with your friends

1804
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,000
you can

1805
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,799
you can help bring them along to the

1806
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,240
idea that

1807
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:18,400
you know all of their problems have a

1808
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,359
common origin that it's it's monopolism

1809
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,960
you know if you have a

1810
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:23,359
a british friend whose local government

1811
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,720
collapsed last year because of carillion

1812
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:26,240
you can say oh yeah the big four

1813
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,000
accounting firms which were allowed to

1814
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,839
buy all of their competitors and merge

1815
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,119
with a bunch of consulting services

1816
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:33,440
they audit the books of all these

1817
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:35,200
companies including you know wirecard

1818
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,040
and uh they forge the books for their

1819
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,520
customers and allow them to steal from

1820
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,200
us

1821
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,880
right so that's not a problem of

1822
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,558
corruption in the accounting industry

1823
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,319
that's a problem of monopoly

1824
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:46,000
and then you can get involved with with

1825
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:47,920
your party with your

1826
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,440
uh social movement if you're involved

1827
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,839
with you know

1828
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,720
uh with uh um nets politique or if

1829
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:55,040
you're involved with

1830
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,000
eff or if you're involved with uh

1831
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,920
quadrature

1832
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,920
you can say look you know this is our my

1833
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,520
priority too you know at eff we have an

1834
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,119
anti-monopoly group now that's been

1835
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,880
working for the last year

1836
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,480
and now that anti-monopoly has come to

1837
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,559
tech you know we

1838
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,680
eff's job is going to be for the next

1839
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,799
years to come

1840
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,799
is going to be making sure that

1841
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:14,079
anti-monopolists understand the

1842
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:15,759
technical dimension

1843
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:17,520
that they don't inadvertently create

1844
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,280
more durable monopolies by fighting it

1845
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:22,559
we need those technical experts

1846
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,359
so you know like in the same way that

1847
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,960
the one

1848
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:27,359
thing that you can do about climate

1849
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,799
change is to find a political party that

1850
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,920
cares about climate change

1851
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:31,839
and then demand that they take

1852
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:34,240
meaningful action the one thing you can

1853
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:37,200
do about monopoly is to get involved

1854
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,240
with anti-monopoly movements because

1855
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,399
your individual

1856
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,479
action isn't going to do enough there

1857
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,400
it's it's it's too little

1858
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,760
as to what gives me hope i mean the

1859
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:49,119
thing that gives me hope is is

1860
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:52,799
we have gone from anti-monopolism

1861
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:56,160
being uh like a fringe thing

1862
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:59,839
that nobody cared about and uh that was

1863
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:01,680
just laughable to it being central

1864
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:03,038
in like literally less than a year like

1865
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:06,240
a year ago

1866
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:09,119
a year and a half ago right march 2019

1867
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:11,359
i stood on a stage in berlin and argued

1868
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:12,799
with europe's top antitrust enforcer

1869
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:14,799
about whether we would ever break up

1870
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:16,880
facebook and she said we wouldn't

1871
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,839
right and she's the most powerful most

1872
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,520
active

1873
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:21,680
most take no prisoners anti-trust

1874
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:24,319
enforcer in the world

1875
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:26,160
today we're ready to break up facebook

1876
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:27,599
it might take a decade but we went from

1877
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:30,160
this is impossible

1878
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:32,000
to let's get doing it in less than a

1879
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,520
year or just over a year

1880
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,520
right that is remarkable progress it

1881
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:38,079
might seem slow but like

1882
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,880
it's a doubling curve you know it's got

1883
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,760
momentum

1884
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,319
like get behind it and push with

1885
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,720
whatever

1886
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:49,839
group with whatever organization you're

1887
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:49,839
involved with push and push and push

1888
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:57,759
and this is a wonderful uh ending um

1889
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:59,520
we are unfortunately out of time uh

1890
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,480
people saying uh they like

1891
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:03,520
this format and i think we'll see a bit

1892
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:07,599
more of that

1893
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:10,480
over the rc3 and i'm really really happy

1894
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:12,079
corey that you were the first of our

1895
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,680
authors

1896
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:16,000
doing a fireside chat and probably will

1897
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,558
have

1898
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,079
some progress on uh turning over

1899
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:23,280
