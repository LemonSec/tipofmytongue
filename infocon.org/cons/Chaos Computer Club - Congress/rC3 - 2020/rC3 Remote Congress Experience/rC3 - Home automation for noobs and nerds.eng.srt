1
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,039
and so we are starting

2
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,360
to switch into the english language and

3
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,280
i

4
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,199
start to present my slides afterwards

5
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,199
after the slides we will go into a

6
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,239
little workshop and hands on

7
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:08,000
with you together hopefully yeah and

8
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,240
let's have some fun on the devices well

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,640
some things about me my name is andre

10
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,640
halen

11
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,960
i was born in the 80s in berlin

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,520
and i'm a member of this ebay since 2001

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,240
and since a couple of years also on the

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,240
board of

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,560
vst based yeah i'm working as a system

16
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,600
and

17
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,439
cloud engineer so this means i have very

18
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,280
many things to do with automations

19
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,158
and um home automation is my personal

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,560
favorite here yeah an ethical hacker who

21
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,280
breaks

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,759
only his own things i don't do any

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,040
really

24
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,680
bad uh only

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,680
an accident

26
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,840
um yeah i started

27
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:01,680
back in 2014 with just quite simple

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,240
things like uh turning my digital

29
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,040
light marks on and off and changing the

30
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,199
color so

31
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,800
this was quite simple in the beginning

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,640
but later i started

33
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,080
to do more things away from the

34
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:22,238
window applications and i would like to

35
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:25,599
enable you today to do the same

36
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,599
what we expect um

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,440
first of all i started with this around

38
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,519
30 minutes

39
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,200
intro about home automation in general

40
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,640
some hardware aspects some

41
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,839
software aspects um i would like to do

42
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,480
some definitions and wording because

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,680
this can

44
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,799
be getting very confusing later

45
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,480
and after this small talk we will

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,519
have a hands-on hopefully we

47
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,000
have one and a half hour or more and

48
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,000
around

49
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,079
we will integrate together if you

50
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,680
already have

51
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,239
exiting hardware that is capable to be

52
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,760
integrated we can do this or if you

53
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,120
don't have any hardware yet

54
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,560
don't be sad we can fake them or

55
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,239
find other interesting digital stuff

56
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,920
that we can integrate into your home

57
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,480
automation

58
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,079
and yeah we will for sure chat about

59
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,518
automation in general

60
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,879
share our experience we love each other

61
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:34,000
so smart what

62
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:38,239
what means smart or what people think

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,680
is smart is a really huge web usually

64
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,400
because people it's not everything

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,440
remote stuff is plug and play and

66
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,599
everything

67
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,920
work for everything you need you can get

68
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,119
from a single vendor

69
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,000
but this is not true you are far away

70
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,720
from this

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,840
if you want to get things smart you have

72
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,120
to do

73
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,439
uh tons of you have to choose

74
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,519
different vendors and we have two of

75
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,640
them everyone have

76
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,519
another kind of implementation somehow

77
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,359
um some of them are also locked into the

78
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,478
cloud so then you have to

79
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,759
free the film somehow or free your

80
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,039
device

81
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,800
from this evil firmware that

82
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,840
by default connects to the new land

83
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,160
and yeah for sure you have

84
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,359
incompatibilities

85
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,919
between different vendors and they don't

86
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,919
like it

87
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,039
if you integrate stuff from other

88
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,039
vendors into war

89
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:42,800
solutions um that makes everything

90
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,639
more complicated than it should be

91
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,680
so yeah how to start usually

92
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,120
people get started quite easy and simple

93
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,520
as i started

94
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,479
with some simple light bulbs these

95
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,719
philips hue

96
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,719
are very common or ostram lightify

97
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:07,359
yeah and in the beginning okay for them

98
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:10,479
if they only do controlling the lights

99
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,919
or they want to see the status means in

100
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,880
the beginning it's okay for you

101
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,520
if you turn on your lights arranging the

102
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,919
color

103
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,680
or receive from remote if it's on or off

104
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,440
when you leave the house quickly and on

105
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,000
the way to somewhere

106
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,560
and can take a look on your mobile to

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,360
see

108
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,840
if you forgot to change some lights off

109
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,759
or

110
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,159
i don't know what this is for the

111
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,520
beginning quite simple

112
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,639
and you can start very easily with this

113
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,159
um so what you what you get

114
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,080
out of the box in the beginning from the

115
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,000
vendors directly i'm

116
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,280
staying at these light bulbs because

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,039
this is the most

118
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,159
easy example to show you

119
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,680
um what what the vendors does or what

120
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,880
the vendors give you

121
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,479
and yeah an easy way to to get started

122
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:06,639
somewhere later we will try to find some

123
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,639
some more interesting examples

124
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,319
but these are reserved for the workshop

125
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,759
so

126
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,639
if you want to get in touch and talk

127
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,880
about

128
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,840
more things

129
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,840
like

130
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,840
this will be done later

131
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
um

132
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:17,840
and

133
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:17,840
then there is

134
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
um

135
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:13,840
and then

136
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,399
[Music]

137
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
yes

138
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,439
okay ladies and gentlemen that's the

139
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,559
next thing

140
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,159
that's live and the bandwidth from tico

141
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,199
is

142
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,399
another somewhere i don't know

143
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,440
um yeah what we should do now um

144
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,480
i think the talk is good and

145
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:58,720
we will just wait a few seconds

146
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:02,399
or a minute so that we can

147
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,600
start again maybe yes so i can

148
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:09,120
see a t for tickle

149
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,240
and hopefully it will be

150
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,240
going better now

151
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:23,839
what happened

152
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
um

153
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,839
can we continue

154
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,359
is it better now

155
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
oh

156
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:24,800
[Music]

157
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:28,160
yes so take a deep breath

158
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,920
keep calm and here we go again

159
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,279
so most of the queens are not really

160
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,959
smart out of the box

161
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,560
except from kinds like uh wake up scenes

162
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,880
when you want to wake up

163
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,439
um by light over a specific amount of

164
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,680
time

165
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,480
means when you want to wake up at around

166
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,920
six

167
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,800
just uh configure your light that it

168
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,920
starts

169
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,079
increasing the percent of light edge uh

170
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,760
over a couple of times and says yeah

171
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,560
when you wake up at six

172
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,319
ten minutes before six it starts to

173
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,680
increasing the lights

174
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,760
uh ten percent per minute and after

175
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,599
ten minutes uh the light is on hundred

176
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,880
percent and you have a very smooth

177
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:14,079
wake up this is nice but that's not

178
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,880
what i understand of smart things this

179
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,279
is just yeah dimming or increasing the

180
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,959
light over a specific amount of time

181
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:25,040
another thing that came out of the box

182
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,719
is a delayed shut off timer if you go to

183
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,120
bed or something like that

184
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,160
and you are away far away from your

185
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,279
digital switch

186
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,560
just push the button say it shut down

187
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:39,839
in 10 minutes and after 10 minutes the

188
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,839
light goes off

189
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,319
another thing that come out of the box

190
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,079
if there is supported hardware is

191
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,440
turning lights on and off by movements

192
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,839
detected

193
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,480
in general you have just the movement

194
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,120
sensor

195
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,920
and this movement sensor triggers the

196
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,360
light to get

197
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,240
on and after a couple of minutes when no

198
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,360
movement was detected it turns off again

199
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,360
this is quite nice

200
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,800
when you go through a room where you're

201
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,920
just

202
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,399
passing by and you want to enable

203
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,199
the lights without touching anything

204
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,600
this is

205
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,639
uh fully automated this is nice this is

206
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,079
kind of smart

207
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:25,600
or what i think what could be smart

208
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:28,079
but the problem is

209
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,839
this only works with supported hardware

210
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,599
when you stick on a window

211
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:36,800
so usually some windows don't have

212
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,560
movement detectors other have them

213
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,560
but they are quite expensive

214
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:47,600
so what is on my personal wish list

215
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:51,680
to have things more smart

216
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,160
is to combine way more things than just

217
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,279
a light with a movement sensor

218
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,639
for example i have

219
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,000
a window open detect detection so i can

220
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,519
detect if a window is open

221
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,480
or not and if the window is open

222
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,199
more than 15 minutes uh because this is

223
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,399
way

224
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,800
enough to get fresh air into the room um

225
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,320
then start blinking indicator in

226
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,800
the living room for example to notify me

227
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,760
that i should close this window or send

228
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,719
me a message

229
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,160
to my mobile over i don't know telegram

230
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,360
push message

231
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,920
whatever you name it and

232
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,760
i won't like to know that i have to

233
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,800
close the window

234
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,319
yeah you can or i would like to

235
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,839
implement also unsupported hardware

236
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,440
um i would like to combine lights with

237
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,240
movement sensors

238
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,240
that i built myself because usually you

239
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,760
can get this developer board with a

240
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,199
wireless chip on it

241
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,240
putting a movement sensor on it and just

242
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,800
use this for your movement detection and

243
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,079
you can

244
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,079
save a lot of money instead of buying uh

245
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,359
very expensive things from the vendor

246
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,079
itself

247
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,199
but this won't happen the easy way

248
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,599
because you stay in the vendor login

249
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,760
and the vendor don't don't want you to

250
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,040
use other things

251
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,319
um so all in all

252
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,920
is this an easy piece of cake yes but

253
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,000
no i would say it depends on or

254
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,000
depends on what you really want to do if

255
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,120
you if you have some simple things that

256
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,839
you want to do

257
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,160
you usually can do this out of the box

258
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,360
with

259
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,160
vendors but when you want to like

260
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,040
to have more advanced tasks when

261
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,519
combining

262
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,199
things from different different vendors

263
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,199
or building your own

264
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,199
sensors or actors or whatever

265
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:56,959
you can't do this the easy way usually

266
00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:00,160
um yeah combination with other devices

267
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:03,199
is not possible the easy way or

268
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:06,480
not with that what what you get shipped

269
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,079
by the vendors so we need to close the

270
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,839
gap by ourselves

271
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:14,959
we will do this later so for now we will

272
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,720
talk a bit about sensors actors what the

273
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,758


274
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,160
and um yeah sensors i

275
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,600
gave you some some example already we

276
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,160
have um

277
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,720
for example movement sensors we can

278
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,279
measure

279
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,560
temperatures we can measure the light

280
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,040
and looks

281
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,439
um yeah anything that can be interesting

282
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,800
for you can be measured

283
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,279
um for example the actual bitcoin price

284
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,120
uh for some people i heard it's quite

285
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,920
interesting to know the actual bitcoin

286
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,759
price

287
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:51,599
and yeah with a smart home automation

288
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,480
you can also send notifications to your

289
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,120
tv

290
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,720
or whatever um to give you an

291
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,079
information about the actual

292
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,279
bitcoin price yes cpu load of a host is

293
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,559
just an example

294
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,599
to show you what you can use as a sensor

295
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,799
because you can

296
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:12,000
vary um every web page

297
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:14,160
you can send shell commands

298
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,359
whatever you want as a sensor and the

299
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,400
result of it

300
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:22,159
can be used later for

301
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,360
other things and we mostly talk about

302
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,000
homosystem today

303
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,240
later i will present you some some other

304
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,960
alternates or what i

305
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,600
what i've seen in the past but don't

306
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,520
like

307
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,918
to use um and that's why i

308
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,200
linked here the home assistant

309
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,160
integration

310
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,760
uh of the available sensors that came

311
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,679
out of the box if you go there

312
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,320
have a look you will find a lot of

313
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:52,400
sensors that you can use

314
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:56,240
even things like sensor type rest

315
00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:00,080
where you can send rest api calls to

316
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:03,679
whatever you named so these are

317
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:07,600
sensors um you also have actors

318
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:11,039
actors um usually just

319
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,799
simple relays means um

320
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,480
when you want to start a heating pump

321
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,559
yeah temperature is too low start

322
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,120
heating pump or start heating whatever

323
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,399
this is

324
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:24,399
your actor you can also um

325
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,400
switch power socket

326
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:32,960
shutter actors are a bit more specific

327
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,600
specific than just switching on and off

328
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,559
because usually you when you close a

329
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,840
shutter you need

330
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,960
the power for a specific amount of time

331
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,360
means shutter actor is a bit more than

332
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,400
just

333
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,600
switching because it's switching over a

334
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,640
time span

335
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,360
and yeah usually actors are everything

336
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,520
that can be

337
00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:00,159
switched somehow

338
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,280
next thing would be automations

339
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,960
automations

340
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:08,320
um yeah if a sensor

341
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:12,799
has a specific state do something this

342
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:15,039
is quite easy if you push the button

343
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,918
turn the light on this is the most

344
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,720
simple

345
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,200
automation you can have but for sure you

346
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,160
can

347
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,520
extend these automation far far far

348
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,000
beyond that

349
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,200
um another thing yeah when pushing

350
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,640
button

351
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,520
light goes on the example from before

352
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,960
if a bitcoin provides is over 90 000

353
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,679
send a message

354
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,760
and let all lights in the house blink

355
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:43,760
like insane

356
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,799
um because you can do a party or i don't

357
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,200
know

358
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,360
and these are things you can do with

359
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,840
automations

360
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,600
so now we will have a short look about

361
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,959
types of hardware you will

362
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,240
find on your way and i will give some

363
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:03,919
not not not really recommendations but

364
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,679
what i've used in the past and

365
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,440
for sure there are always way more

366
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,720
examples than

367
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,520
just the shown one um yeah in general

368
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,159
you have lights

369
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,639
for sure as i told you the the the most

370
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,320
common

371
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:22,240
are philips hue or osram lightify

372
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:26,158
and the less expensive version is

373
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,960
the thing like lumi lumineer um

374
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,080
but you need to know that some of them

375
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,480
are working on

376
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,158
zigbee standard and maybe needs an own

377
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,720
bridge or something like that

378
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:42,799
and others are just with these

379
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:45,840
um esp with these small esp

380
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,760
chips on it to be able to use

381
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,840
wi-fi yeah and then you can simply

382
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,520
connect it to your wi-fi and it's a

383
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,280
client in your wifi and for sure

384
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,960
if you have a look at ali express you

385
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,960
will find many many more

386
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:04,960
vendors but in general you have usually

387
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,440
zigbee in it or bluetooth or wi-fi

388
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,440
that's it

389
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:15,120
yeah another thing that you for sure

390
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,080
will be neat is switches for switches

391
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,120
you can have

392
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,000
again you you have uh

393
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,360
nice switches that you can uh put on a

394
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,280
plate on the wall

395
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,199
or on a magnetic um on some you can put

396
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,600
it on metal and it keeps there or you

397
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,880
move around and just use it like a

398
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,918
remote

399
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,120
um xiaomi also has

400
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:42,159
um switches same for zonov

401
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,439
and shelly these are used here if you if

402
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,480
you have

403
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,679
a voltage that you want to switch

404
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,240
or a power plug you can

405
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,840
control these by zonov or shelleys and

406
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,559
for sure there are also many other

407
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,879
switches

408
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:01,840
available um

409
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,320
heating control heating control is um

410
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,039
quite interesting if you have an house

411
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,678
but if you live in a flat this can also

412
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,400
be

413
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,360
nice to heat up uh your bathroom or

414
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,200
something like that

415
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,559
yeah in the morning if you don't like it

416
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,039
too cold in there

417
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:20,000
just two or three hours before you wake

418
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,640
up start increasing the temperature

419
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,760
by your automation this can be done home

420
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,440
automatic

421
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:30,720
is used for underfloor heating mainly

422
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:34,159
at hardware and avm are for

423
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,880
these generic heaters that's put

424
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,840
to the wall and can be controlled by

425
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,840
turning

426
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,840
the vessels off and on

427
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:49,199
yeah in general you can connect

428
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,799
any device that can be connected somehow

429
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,280
yeah by bluetooth wifi zigbee

430
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,158
and some some other standards but these

431
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,440
are the most

432
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:03,760
common things that you that you

433
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:07,600
connect yeah on the vendor side it's

434
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:10,000
it's a bit sad you for for every

435
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,840
from every window you get different

436
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,520
applications and you can't

437
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,039
combine them together as i told you

438
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,760
before this is quite

439
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,520
pain in the ass and i don't like it i

440
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,879
like it on a single

441
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,158
single page and a general overview about

442
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,280
everything without

443
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,679
uh usually if you if you want to if

444
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,120
you have lights yeah and you have two

445
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,960
lights from different windows that are

446
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,039
not compatible to each other

447
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,640
and you have two of them in a single

448
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,360
room and you want to

449
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,720
activate both at the same time this is

450
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,399
only possible if you open

451
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:47,600
f1 say light on going to the second app

452
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,600
turn light on and yeah i i think nobody

453
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,639
wants to do this or the other way is

454
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,760
stick at a single vendor but this is

455
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,960
most of the time not the case

456
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,559
um yeah usually the the

457
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,200
source code of the valuer is closed so

458
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,799
i'm very happy if there is a custom

459
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,000
firmware built by

460
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:13,279
uh hardcore nerds who yeah generate new

461
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,799
new possibilities to the same hardware

462
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:19,840
that the vendor wasn't able able to

463
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:23,120
send to the customer yeah some also have

464
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:26,320
xml and rest apis um but

465
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,678
mostly they are just reverse engineered

466
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,879
somehow and not really well documented

467
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:36,480
documented online

468
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:39,600
so what we need to close

469
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:43,679
the missing gap we need to put

470
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:46,639
put some glue in between and this

471
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,919
glue is called generally smart hub and

472
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,559
there are

473
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,279
some solutions for it that i would like

474
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,639
to show you

475
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:57,039
right now so the first

476
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,840
thing that you maybe already heard of

477
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,799
and

478
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,600
most people who looking into home

479
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,639
automation

480
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,320
finds it or if you

481
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,480
if you have it in mind for a longer time

482
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,840
i'm sure you already struggled about it

483
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,000
the first thing is

484
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:20,080
fhem in german it is french

485
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,960
house automation and in english it is a

486
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,000
friendly

487
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:27,120
home automation and energy measurement

488
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,960
this was developed in 2005

489
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:34,158
and written in pearl um

490
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,360
but i have to say pro isn't my personal

491
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,880
preference

492
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:41,840
um you can do very much things with it

493
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,039
it's quite lightweight it would be run

494
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,120
on a raspy

495
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,080
but yeah i don't really like to do

496
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,719
everything in pearl

497
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,678
if you have affinity to pearl you can

498
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,720
use it for sure

499
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:56,720
it's nice there are a lot of things but

500
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:59,520
you have to do very many things manually

501
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,919
and yeah if you have something more

502
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,120
exotic you always have to

503
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:08,799
yeah write your own code

504
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:12,158
another thing that exists is um openhab

505
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,799
um it was developed in 2010

506
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,360
and it's written in java i don't know

507
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:21,279
what you think about java but i think

508
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:24,479
java is just a huge mess and my personal

509
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,440
preference is always to have it as small

510
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,480
as possible

511
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,760
and it should be fit on a raspy or some

512
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,919
small device yeah for openhab this is

513
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:38,000
not possible to have it run

514
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:41,279
on such a lightweight device

515
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,640
here we go in 2013

516
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:47,679
um home assistant was developed and

517
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,159
written in python

518
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,279
and this is my personal favorite i will

519
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,400
show you in a second

520
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:59,520
how why

521
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:02,720
um another thing is io broker

522
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,879
um this was developed in 2014 and is

523
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,520
written in javascript so it's

524
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:12,640
mostly node.js applications somehow

525
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,600
but to be honest i haven't tested it yet

526
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,679
so i have no real experience with io

527
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,080
broker just

528
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,559
reach some some stuff and i don't really

529
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:26,240
like javascript at all so

530
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:30,480
this is a no-go for me personal and

531
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:34,240
i like it way more in the python world

532
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:37,600
so my personal decision was in this case

533
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,640
home assistant i've started with

534
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,000
fhtm in the beginning and had a very

535
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,559
very very short look

536
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,559
into openhab in between but

537
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,440
since a couple of years for three years

538
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,760
now i'm using

539
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,600
no two years now i'm using home

540
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,559
assistant and started quite

541
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,158
quite simple yeah it and there are some

542
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,520
some reasons why

543
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,440
um first of all it's it's slim or

544
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,879
lightweight enough to be run on a

545
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,919
raspberry pi

546
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:13,360
starting from version three b

547
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:16,000
plus i guess um it has a focus on

548
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,000
security

549
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,719
the focus to keep your data at home yeah

550
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,760
because you don't want to

551
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:27,279
publish all your home automations to the

552
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:30,320
interwebs because um

553
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,360
yeah i want to free the devices from the

554
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,799
clouds

555
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,199
uh not to give it back to the cloud um

556
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,639
i would like to have it at home yeah

557
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,919
it's pure open source

558
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,720
written in python as i told you before

559
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,919
and uses the jamil syntax for

560
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,240
configuration

561
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,799
and because i use it at work it's a

562
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,440
personal plus i have to do it

563
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,799
i have to work with it every day and i

564
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,640
really like

565
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:01,440
really much like the way of configuring

566
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,320
things in home assistant and that's why

567
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,960
i use it

568
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,760
yeah it's very easy to start with so in

569
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,799
the beginning

570
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,720
you you can get in home automation

571
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,039
system quite fast but later if you want

572
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,720
to

573
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:19,760
get way more in detail um

574
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,000
you can you can also get way much deeper

575
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,120
and develop your custom integrations or

576
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,039
whatever you want

577
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,559
but these are the same things you could

578
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,240
do with fhm

579
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,840
for sure as well yeah if you want to

580
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,960
write your own stuff you could do this

581
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,279
with them as well

582
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,880
but home assistant i think is the yeah

583
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,360
in the middle of everything yeah it's

584
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,960
easy to start but good enough could get

585
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:45,120
way way deeper they have really fast

586
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,559
development and release cycles have a

587
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,678
very very active

588
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:52,720
community um

589
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:56,000
and i never had any problems with with

590
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,880
updates in the past so

591
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,760
the good things about home assistants

592
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,120
it's

593
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,960
very very easy to start it is

594
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,199
the documentation is awesome so for

595
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,320
every module you find

596
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,120
a good good

597
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,799
overview page where you find examples

598
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,879
for configurations

599
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,879
and if you have to keep something in

600
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,640
mind this is also noted on the

601
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,320
documentation page

602
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:27,760
it has a really nice performance

603
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:31,520
depending on some some things i will

604
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:34,480
talk a bit later about um

605
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,279
they continuously improving the user

606
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,799
interface

607
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,919
one year ago i guess there was a huge

608
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,120
update for the

609
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:46,320
lovelace interface to be more

610
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,918
drag and droppable for beginners

611
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,080
that they are able to configure

612
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,760
everything

613
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,520
the nice thing on home assistant as well

614
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,399
is that you can configure

615
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,519
things on the graphical user interface

616
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,120
as well as

617
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:03,519
in your configuration files by yaml

618
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,518
yeah it's very easy to maintain if you

619
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,480
need to do updates

620
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,519
you get notifications you can do the

621
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,559
updates by

622
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:16,399
simply clicking on your web interface on

623
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:19,519
updates and in the last two years i

624
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:22,719
didn't have any issues with it

625
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,919
yeah i also had to migrate once from a

626
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,880
raspberry p pi 3 b

627
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,399
plus to a newer version and this also

628
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,279
works like a charm

629
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:35,840
um just do a backup of your actual

630
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,320
system by pushing a button download the

631
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,519
file

632
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,840
and import this backup into the new

633
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,440
um system and everything works again

634
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,918
like before

635
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,120
so this is quite nice but there are also

636
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,960
some bad things

637
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,559
or not so good things um first of all

638
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,399
sometimes it's a bit hard to find

639
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,639
debugging information

640
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,000
um i had the problem that i was looking

641
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,640
for debugging information

642
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,360
but at the end i found out there was no

643
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,240
problem

644
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,360
because it was just a broken wire or

645
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,600
something

646
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,439
in this case it's a bit hard to find

647
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,240
some some errors but there was no error

648
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,960
for sure

649
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,399
that's why it was not working but it

650
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,880
could be better but

651
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,120
i will show you in the workshop some

652
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,720
some some overview about home assistant

653
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,360
and guide you through the different

654
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:27,919
levels of loggings

655
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,639
and then you maybe will see what i mean

656
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,039
yeah

657
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,399
a very important thing is that you don't

658
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,039
choose a too small

659
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,799
sd card in the beginning i was using a 8

660
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,279
gigabyte sd card

661
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,840
and thought it would be enough but you

662
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,000
have

663
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,039
historical data that will be saved on a

664
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,799
specific

665
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:48,799
time and depending on number of sensors

666
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:52,799
you have this can be increased very

667
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:56,200
fast so don't choose it

668
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,879
too small but yeah i think 64

669
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,919
128 gigabyte should be way more than

670
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,960
enough

671
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,919
um another point is don't use two slow

672
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,120
sd cards

673
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,519
um because

674
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,399
or in the past it was only possible to

675
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,960
have

676
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,239
everything on an sd card and if the sd

677
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,279
card is too slow

678
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,240
this takes a much of time to boot the

679
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,360
system

680
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,480
it's always kind of leggy but yeah

681
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,959
you know if you put in very old hard

682
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,640
drive

683
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,360
into a up-to-date computer you will get

684
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,960
the same for sure so have a look on the

685
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,879
performance of the sdk

686
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,279
card i can give you some recommendations

687
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,559
later um

688
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:43,919
but for now it's just the hint to

689
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:47,519
take care of the speed of your card

690
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:50,080
um yeah another thing that

691
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,080
disturbs me is that you sometimes have

692
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,600
duplicated items

693
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,840
if you're using bluetooth tracking or

694
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,320
something like that

695
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,879
over time you get duplicated items or if

696
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,879
you have

697
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,120
multiple devices with the same account

698
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,960
locked and you get duplicated items

699
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,520
and it's quite a mess to delete these

700
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,800
duplicated item afterwards

701
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:16,239
um yes

702
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,040
so a very very very short preview to the

703
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,399
workshop

704
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,440
that should be started really soon

705
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:26,560
if you want to attend or to

706
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,720
to have you to want to attend

707
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,320
i will give you a short overview for the

708
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:33,199
beginning so we will

709
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,000
insta some home assistant on a raspberry

710
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,078
pi or if

711
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,719
you want to use virtualbox we can also

712
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,480
install it in virtualbox

713
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,480
i will give you an overview about the

714
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,399
user interface

715
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,760
we will create some sensors together

716
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:51,759
we will create some actions and

717
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,800
yeah i will show you some some useful

718
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,040
hardware

719
00:34:52,800 --> 00:35:00,839
like these node mcus or these d1

720
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,200
mini to build your custom

721
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:05,440
sensors for your personal needs

722
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,279
because the huge problem is that you

723
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,480
start a specific

724
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,480
point and want to increase over time

725
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,760
everything because usually you can't

726
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,000
plan everything

727
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,760
right now or maybe you don't have the

728
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,839
money to buy everything right now and

729
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,800
you can go step by step and

730
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:24,160
to save some money it's way more cheap

731
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,920
to

732
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,920
solder those things by hand

733
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,079
yeah and for sure i will show you how to

734
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,240
extend the

735
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,200
possibilities by adding community

736
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,200
integrations

737
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,720
you have a lot of integrations already

738
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,439
built in but sometimes

739
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,839
you need a bit more and therefore the

740
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,839
community integrations are quite nice

741
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,960
and i will show it to you in the

742
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,320
workshop later

743
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,960
uh yeah also we have the the

744
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,920
esps i will show you how to flash these

745
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,040
esps

746
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,880
quite easy i will show some some

747
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,800
examples with a movement

748
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,040
and temperature sensors i also have some

749
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,680
some some relays

750
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,079
in my home to to open and close the

751
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,560
garage

752
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,320
door or something like that that can be

753
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,119
shown later

754
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,480
and yeah an interesting tool um that i

755
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,280
would like to show you

756
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,640
is the esp home thingy because flashing

757
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,280
those esp's is

758
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:30,078
quite easy with esp home and also

759
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:34,000
configuration of different

760
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,000
components is very very easy

761
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:41,200
so um now we can go

762
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,800
to the workshop um if you have questions

763
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,078
you can ask these questions in the

764
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,440
workshop later

765
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:51,440
um you can go to the jitsi room

766
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:55,280
at jitsi.cbase.org

767
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:59,200
rc3 rt3 foo

768
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:02,240
and the super secure password 2342

769
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,279
and yeah if you would like to

770
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,160
start by yourself you can simply go to

771
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,599
the

772
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,839
url on this checkout link

773
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,920
um home assistant i o has io

774
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,920
installation

775
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,520
have a look on the type of installation

776
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,960
you want to do

777
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,599
as i told you you have different

778
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,720
possibilities you can install it as a vm

779
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,560
you can put it on a raspy and even for

780
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,598
putting on a raspy there are

781
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,400
several ways to do this the most easy

782
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,599
way is just

783
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:38,000
to use the generic

784
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:41,839
os image where you have an

785
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:46,320
home assistant operating system

786
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:48,839
and everything is installed

787
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,839
inside a docker's contact docker

788
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,839
container

789
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:59,200
[Music]

790
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,680
can the raspbian or something like that

791
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:05,359
install it by yourself

792
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:08,560
via docker or directly

793
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:10,960
okay we can see that a lot of people

794
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,000
will attend the workshop from

795
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:17,440
function we

796
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,920
stop our stream now with tico and

797
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,960
take or have fun with your workshop good

798
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,280
luck

799
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,720
toy

800
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:29,040
[Music]

801
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,040
thank you see you
