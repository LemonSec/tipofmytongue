10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,760
be here participating in the chaos

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,680
um i can say that i've i've intended to

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,640
for years

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,920
but uh finally maybe due to the pandemic

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,960
i'm finally here

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,760
so um it's it's great to uh

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,760
to be here after observing from afar for

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,039
about 25 years

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,000
um anyway uh

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,800
i was told that the other day that i'm

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,079
getting kind of

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,199
old one of the yes men are elderly

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,840
now and so a lot of people wouldn't

23
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,959
you know know very much about the types

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,119
of things or what

25
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,199
we had been doing and i'll admit i i've

26
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,000
forgotten most of it myself so i i

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,400
looked through the

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,920
uh i look through the archives for

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,200
something that would introduce

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,920
uh what we do a little bit and um

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,240
i found the picture that you see uh here

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,680
where i'm holding up an exxon mobil

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,560
card business card and then uh andy

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,280
who's uh the guy that i work with at the

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,079
yes men

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,400
um the co-founder of the group is there

37
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,279
holding a national petroleum council

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,320
card and this is

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,680
from an event that we are at in i think

40
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,720
two thousand

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,520
or so where we went to

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,520
a conference

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,960
in calgary alberta representing these

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,000
two companies

45
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,199
um yeah we've we've been uh wheezing uh

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,880
weaseling our way

47
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,920
into events conferences and sometimes

48
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,798
online

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,799
types of uh

50
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,200
venues for over two decades now

51
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,840
and um representing people in power

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,119
and we do one of two things either we do

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,520
something satirical

54
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,280
and funny in front of an audience that

55
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,280
usually thinks we are the most powerful

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,480
people in the room

57
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:29,040
uh we do something that

58
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,359
is more um utopian where we announce

59
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,440
the reality that we might like to see

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,560
like in our wildest dreams what we

61
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,599
might think exxonmobil might say if they

62
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,000
suddenly turned around and stopped being

63
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,560
some of the world's uh largest climate

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,400
criminals and had a kind of reckoning

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,680
and woke up and decided to

66
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,040
fight climate change so um anyway

67
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,879
uh there's been a lot of things that

68
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,040
have happened over the last two decades

69
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,079
in terms of the media landscape

70
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,760
and you know the sort of flexibility

71
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,800
of reality that have made our tactics

72
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,720
more or less useful also like who's in

73
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,680
power politically makes a difference

74
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,599
because this

75
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,959
the types of things that we do this kind

76
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,200
of mischief

77
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,000
we find works pretty well when there's

78
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,280
um people

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,360
who are movable who's uh

80
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,360
in office whereas if you have a total

81
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,080
despotic tyrant then you have to go to

82
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,400
more tactical methods instead of uh

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,000
the types of things that that we do that

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,040
are all about

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,879
you know pushing um political

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,840
uh leaders to uh to change or about

87
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,359
sort of bolstering a movement like

88
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,040
creating some exciting

89
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,319
fun entertaining uh media

90
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,319
that um shows us all that the

91
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,439
people that we're fighting are actually

92
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,679
really

93
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,519
uh fallible and no different than than

94
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,400
you and i despite the kind of power that

95
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,159
they hold

96
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,680
so um i'm gonna go ahead and play a

97
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,720
little video clip here hopefully it

98
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,319
works

99
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:10,959
um this is a video clip from uh

100
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,958
our second third yes men film

stage

114
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,520
at least for a little while mr osborne

115
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,560
you're not even on the directory of hyde

116
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,680
you're not even listed how you don't

117
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,040
even have a phone number

118
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,000
it's come to that has it the house was

119
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,840
an elaborate one

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,880
for the first time dao is accepting full

121
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,000
responsibility for the bhopal

122
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,680
catastrophe

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,840
for the prank which briefly knocked

124
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,320
three percent off dao shares

125
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,239
when the jig is up it makes the news

126
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,680
it's a group of pranksters who call

127
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,639
themselves the yes men

128
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,880
an activist group called yes men it's

129
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:17,050
not the way most people protest

130
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,020
but it's our way to say no to corporate

131
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:22,840
[Music]

132
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:25,280
[Laughter]

133
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,880
greed

134
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,799
whoops okay

135
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,400
so um i just want to give a little bit

136
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,240
of backstory we've made three

137
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,719
films um three feature docs

138
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,800
in the la in the last 15 years we

139
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,440
released one it seems every five years

140
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,960
it's kind of a compilation of a bunch of

141
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,600
the antics

142
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,320
um that we've um the the exploits

143
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,880
whatever we want to call them

144
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,400
but a lot of people uh ask well how do

145
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,000
you start doing this

146
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,638
why you know not in addition to why how

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,280
and it all kind of happened by accident

148
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,120
um

149
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,960
i just wanted to start out by showing

150
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,960
you the the world trade organization

151
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,960
headquarters in geneva

152
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,799
um this is obviously a pretty large

153
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,440
building uh in one of the

154
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,479
um most expensive real estate markets in

155
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,639
the world

156
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:23,199
and um how did we get our first um

157
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,080
major kind of exploit like this was when

158
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,280
we

159
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,240
um when we actually impersonated the

160
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,359
the wto and so you know this is their

161
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,319
headquarters

162
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,000
this at the time was our headquarters

163
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,039
you can see this little

164
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,759
cut here is where we lived um

165
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,000
this is a a meeting of the om say the

166
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,000
wto and of course this is the kind of

167
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,800
meeting that we used to have

168
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,120
um and so people would say well how did

169
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,240
you

170
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,440
end up representing the wto

171
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,160
on television you know on stage

172
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,639
at business meetings uh here we are um

173
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,919
standing with several dignitaries

174
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,599
in australia after a trade conference

175
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,359
there

176
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,120
and uh the answer was is is actually

177
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,479
way simpler than it needs to be like a

178
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,759
lot of

179
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,880
things with social engineering it's

180
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,800
actually a lot

181
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,000
dumber and less technical than people

182
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,639
imagine

183
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,160
um this is andy at a computer that's

184
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,759
that thing down there that's called

185
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,120
that's called a computer there's a

186
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:32,120
television in the background a crt

187
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,160
we had put up a website called

188
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,360
gwbush.com that was meant to be a

189
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,440
satirical website for george bush

190
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,680
who at the time was running for

191
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,639
president he wasn't president yet

192
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,440
um but you can see that his banner for

193
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,639
his website

194
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,240
said valuable uh said education values

195
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,440
responsibility it's the

196
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,680
the ban around the bottom and then

197
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,440
our banner at the top said valuable

198
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,560
educated prosperous these are

199
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,680
subtle um differences

200
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,879
but they're differences that um make a

201
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,400
big difference in in

202
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:11,039
english uh because um there

203
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,318
and of course in this one instead of

204
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,479
sitting with his

205
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,520
wife smiling in front of the texas state

206
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,960
capitol

207
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,758
he's pointing his finger at black people

208
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,638
so it was meant to be satirical but it

209
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,720
turned out

210
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:30,000
a lot of people took it seriously anyway

211
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,519
and uh it got a lot of press coverage

212
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,200
this is some old an old netscape window

213
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,240
browser window here

214
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,320
um and then um

215
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,599
sorry it got a lot of press coverage and

216
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,680
actually

217
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:49,839
uh george bush denounced it

218
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:53,439
at several um press conferences

219
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,760
and he made a famous quote at the time

220
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,480
although he made tons of famous gaffes

221
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,600
and at this press conference he said

222
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,000
about us

223
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,920
there ought to be limits to freedom that

224
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,920
was what he was

225
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,479
suggesting when when they asked what

226
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,079
they should do about us for making this

227
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,600
website that looked like he hasn't made

228
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,720
fun of him

229
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,640
um we put up a website at gap.org

230
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,800
which a lot of people associated with

231
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,279
the world trade organization

232
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,959
because gat the global agreement on

233
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,080
tariffs and trade

234
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,518
was the predecessor organization to the

235
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,720
wto

236
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,800
and the predecessor the previously

237
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,959
existing agreement

238
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,560
so um we have that website this is

239
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,199
actually uh bretton woods

240
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,079
where they first set up the gat uh i

241
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,839
believe in 1946

242
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,600
um and then of course the wto building

243
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,399
that you've already seen on the shores

244
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,399
of geneva

245
00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:00,480
now in the early 1990s the mid

246
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,279
late 1990s there was a big global

247
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,560
movement

248
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,760
against neoliberalization and neoliberal

249
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,560
policies

250
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,800
and the wto is a big focus of that and

251
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,518
andy and i were participating

252
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,240
this is one of the marches that you see

253
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,120
of people

254
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,000
mostly in the global south who were

255
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,440
rebelling

256
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,839
against the free market ideologies that

257
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,120
were

258
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:28,320
really uh hurting the poorest of people

259
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,160
in many of those countries um

260
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,519
and of course there were protests like

261
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,719
the famous battle

262
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,880
of seattle um which uh

263
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,240
was famous because it shut down the city

264
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,000
of seattle during a

265
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,120
omc meeting and this is a great picture

266
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,160
of uh

267
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,760
of what it's like to be to be there at

268
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,760
that event it was uh

269
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,200
but unfortunately we couldn't be there

270
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,120
me and andy

271
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,640
couldn't be there to experience this

272
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,240
wonderful feeling

273
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:02,240
of tear gas and so feeling left out

274
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:06,160
um we put up a fake website for the wto

275
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,720
and again it's a satirical website but

276
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,240
it's at

277
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,680
gatt.org and unlike the wto's

278
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,600
website that um

279
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:20,319
the wto's website was very hard to

280
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,120
find out how to talk to anybody there um

281
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,839
although they

282
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,279
emphasized their transparency as an

283
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,399
organization

284
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,800
um they were very hard to actually speak

285
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,079
to

286
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,760
and since their web page had literally

287
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,359
thousands of pages of documents legal

288
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,160
documents that

289
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,640
you needed to be a lawyer to understand

290
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,760
um

291
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:47,680
ultimately it wasn't very transparent

292
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,959
um and so uh our website

293
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:53,519
on the other hand gap.org was very easy

294
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,160
to hit the contact button and get in

295
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,639
touch

296
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,279
uh with what a lot of people turned out

297
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,560
to think

298
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:04,079
was the or the wto

299
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,920
now that became news

300
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:10,000
and uh the wto

301
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,680
has issued a press release saying

302
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,360
warning fake wto website

303
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,638
um and so since they had actually then

304
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,560
sent this

305
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,839
press release to their entire mailing

306
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,518
list

307
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:28,639
uh the google algorithm which was fairly

308
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,680
new at the time um

309
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,240
ranked our our website very high

310
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,239
in the uh in the rankings just below

311
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,760
theirs actually without any warnings

312
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,480
about it being fake

313
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,399
so many people would go to their real

314
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,800
wto website

315
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,079
would fail to be able to get in touch

316
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,079
with them

317
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,920
and then instead would actually come to

318
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,239
our website

319
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,439
and on our website we posted these

320
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,920
alerts like

321
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,079
fake wto website misleading the public

322
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,240
just to make sure that people knew

323
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,199
that we hit that we existed we wanted to

324
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,680
help them

325
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,639
help the wto do this work of warning

326
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,959
people

327
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,399
about the the fakes this sort of hall of

328
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,000
mirrors

329
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,000
um so once again the word deplorable

330
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,519
gets used in reference to us

331
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
this here is uh the then director

332
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,360
general of the wto whose name happened

333
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,880
to be

334
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,920
mike moore and he was from new zealand

335
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,439
very different

336
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,120
he's a former prime minister of new

337
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,519
zealand very different prime minister

338
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,560
than

339
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,040
they have now really um but

340
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,560
he held a press conference where he

341
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,040
announced that he deplored

342
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,359
fake the fake website and said that they

343
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,560
undermine the transparency

344
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,120
um and so of course we published this on

345
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,959
our

346
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:52,639
fake website as well and then

347
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:55,839
immediately it gets picked up and widely

348
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,560
widely picked up by the press

349
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,959
so without actually going to seattle we

350
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,160
managed to actually engage

351
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,319
the wto and to get them to

352
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,800
talk to us to address us and then to get

353
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,480
several rounds of media attention

354
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,880
that we use to try to redirect traffic

355
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,079
to what was happening in seattle to what

356
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,360
was happening on the ground

357
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,760
with the movement um

358
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,920
and actually this for us we've been

359
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,680
doing things like this before but for us

360
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,519
this was like a really big win

361
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,719
because we realized wow this took very

362
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,839
little work

363
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,079
it was a lot of fun and with

364
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,440
absolutely no power you know you

365
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,920
remember what our office looked like

366
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,760
compared to the wtos

367
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:45,120
we were able to um sort of uh

368
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:48,720
do these moves that would um

369
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:52,800
uh throw a much heavier opponent

370
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:56,560
um like like judo moves

371
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,959
and so anyway we got into it

372
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,399
so many people then were mistaking our

373
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,359
website for theirs

374
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,680
thanks to um the sort of internet being

375
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,639
so

376
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,399
new and the the you know the i mean the

377
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,160
web the world wide web and the way

378
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,480
search engines worked

379
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,240
um that uh we got a lot of email from

380
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,639
people questions like

381
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,320
could you advise me of the relationship

382
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,199
of gibraltar

383
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,000
to the wto and this is the treasury

384
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,479
department

385
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,519
of the isle of man asking us this

386
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,839
question

387
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,759
so you know it's it's fun it's

388
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,160
entertaining this is

389
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,800
um another question might be i would

390
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,600
like to

391
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,399
interview a wto spokesperson on south

392
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,519
america's new technology sector

393
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,759
um by the way on the relationship of

394
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,680
gibraltar to the wto we explained in

395
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,199
detail how gibraltar

396
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,519
was a rock south of spain a really big

397
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,519
rock

398
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,160
in the basically in between the

399
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:59,519
mediterranean and in the atlantic ocean

400
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,560
and the wto was this you know human

401
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,680
construction imagination organization

402
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,920
very different thing um so we could we

403
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,199
became experts basically very quickly

404
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,959
overnight

405
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:15,680
um uh it was a lot of fun

406
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,439
and then finally we were so good at it

407
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,560
so good at being the wto

408
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,040
that we started to get invitations can

409
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,719
director general mike moore address our

410
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,319
conference in salzburg

411
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:31,360
was a question we got and uh

412
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,639
well this is mike moore this is what he

413
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,160
looks like and we realized

414
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:39,600
damn we can't we can't possibly be

415
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,199
that guy um you know this is a problem

416
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,160
we can't send him either

417
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,079
um so we wrote to them and we said well

418
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,600
we can't send you director general mike

419
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,800
moore but we would very much

420
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,320
like to send a substitute and that's

421
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,519
when they embraced the idea

422
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,279
of andrea spickelbauer dr andreas

423
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,680
bickelbauer which is a name we got

424
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,120
out of the vienna phone book actually a

425
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,480
friend of ours

426
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,439
uh hans of uber morgan had um

427
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,240
sort of sponsored our trip by uh leaving

428
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,319
some cash on the table of his apartment

429
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,559
and uh leaving us the keys so when we

430
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:18,159
when we arrived in vienna

431
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:20,160
um with our new thrift store suits

432
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,360
we were immediately ready to go to this

433
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,919
conference

434
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,280
as the world trade organization so

435
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,319
that's sort of how it happened in the

436
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,879
beginning

437
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:33,840
this adventure in mischief which is now

438
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,880
lasted 20 years um doing these things in

439
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,760
person

440
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,480
um was something that just uh almost

441
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,879
sort of

442
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,679
like occurred spontaneously but then

443
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,480
once we are

444
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,600
on to that and into that it became quite

445
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,960
a

446
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,360
energizing and addictive sport

447
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,559
thing that we've got a sport coat that

448
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,520
launched us

449
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,440
uh onto the 20 years of fun and

450
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,120
excitement and um we haven't quite

451
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,799
landed yet but i'm

452
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,639
i'm worried about that landing because

453
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:07,840
it could could be a rough one

454
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,039
so i want to just frame what we're doing

455
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,320
a little more

456
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:14,480
uh you know

457
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,879
some of you probably recognize this guy

458
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,039
this is santa claus

459
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,160
this is an actual photograph of santa

460
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,640
claus

461
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,640
emerging from a chimney looking at a

462
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,760
photographer who happens to be crouched

463
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,880
in this

464
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,320
room in somebody's house uh they both

465
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,640
had to break in

466
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,320
in order to do this and so my point here

467
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,720
is that

468
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,360
you know we love mischief we love

469
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,000
mischief

470
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,559
and we actually even love trespass we

471
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,080
love

472
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,480
breaking in we love breaking and

473
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:49,199
entering uh the stories

474
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:53,160
of crossing borders crossing boundaries

475
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,720
changing shape putting on disguises the

476
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,679
masquerade

477
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,960
these are the stories that um really

478
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,799
carry us

479
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,160
through history you know they're the

480
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,280
they're they're some of our oldest

481
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,640
stories

482
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,840
and this season with christmas is no

483
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,919
exception now

484
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,080
the stories have been hijacked and

485
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,960
manipulated in a number of ways

486
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,280
just as all information and stories are

487
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,880
uh

488
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,678
in our culture and you know santa

489
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,880
clause's reckless break-ins

490
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,160
um in order to leave gifts have become

491
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,559
something uh

492
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,320
hijacked by capitalism or in part

493
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,559
created by capitalism

494
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,360
but the fact that we want to lean on

495
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,200
this idea of him trespassing i think is

496
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,199
is really important it's a key to

497
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,440
something so remember

498
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,960
don't tell anybody though as santa claus

499
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,640
would do so

500
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,360
uh we have this this history uh we see

501
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,120
it fitting into

502
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,639
something that's sort of common to all

503
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,879
cultures and this is the

504
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,840
the idea of the trickster um this is

505
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,440
uh often a deity or sometimes it's

506
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,760
actually based on a real historical

507
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,120
figure that's more recent

508
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,200
but all cultures uh have these i won't

509
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,199
say all but nearly all cultures have

510
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,840
these trickster characters

511
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,039
um there's a few listed on this uh sort

512
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,080
of cartoon image

513
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:19,360
here um kokopelli of the hopi

514
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,199
or the zuni um which is uh

515
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,918
you know in the in the united states in

516
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,480
the uh north america

517
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,559
original people north america anansi the

518
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,159
spider of west africa the raven in the

519
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:33,360
pacific northwest

520
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,000
um it goes on and on um because they're

521
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,879
they're

522
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,440
everywhere everybody has these and it

523
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,520
doesn't

524
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,799
take too much digging to find out about

525
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,039
your own trickster

526
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,039
character and your culture and since

527
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,720
we're kind of

528
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:51,280
in i think mostly in germany right now

529
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,360
um and actually my mother is dutch so

530
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,720
i'm gonna stick with uh i'm gonna go

531
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,360
with reynard the fox

532
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,039
or the fox as a as a character as a

533
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,039
trickster character

534
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,039
and so we're gonna look at a little bit

535
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,720
more history through the fox's lens to

536
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,080
frame the types of things that we're

537
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,520
doing

538
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:14,240
through the eyes of the of the trickster

539
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:17,600
um jesus another trickster

540
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,080
and i'm you know i'm not a big fan um

541
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,760
although i am a fan of some of his

542
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,760
original tactics

543
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,679
you know he wrote in on this donkey and

544
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,158
this is an actual photograph of him

545
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,480
because

546
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,360
you know somebody had a time machine and

547
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,120
went back and

548
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,918
got this shot of him riding a donkey

549
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,559
uh into bethlehem and you know this is

550
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,039
like

551
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,879
nobody rides a donkey um or into

552
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,679
jerusalem nobody rides a donkey

553
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,520
it didn't make sense he did it because

554
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,520
he knew that people would talk about it

555
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,080
it was a symbolic action

556
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,440
that was meant to uh project a kind of

557
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,280
humility

558
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,799
um and and make people tell stories

559
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,760
about what happened

560
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,799
so the idea was to propagate this myth

561
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,320
which of course

562
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:07,360
worked so well that now we have you know

563
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,158
we have christianity um but here's

564
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,199
nasrudin writing a donkey backwards

565
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:16,320
a century later um

566
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:20,080
and again an original photo um

567
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,720
this is uh sort of a wise sage coming

568
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,918
from

569
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,840
uh out of turkey and part of islamic

570
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,840
tradition

571
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:32,639
um and uh again all these stories though

572
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,439
are stories of a kind of wisdom and

573
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,039
these are sort of

574
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,480
the reason i say they're tricksters is

575
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,760
that they were

576
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,919
um fighting larger powers i mean

577
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,280
you know jesus was fighting the romans

578
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,120
jesus was

579
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,280
leading a movement of liberation at the

580
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,320
time it became something entirely

581
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,360
different

582
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,360
um but uh you know we see

583
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,439
the same thing yeah this this version of

584
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,799
the trickster that's nasruddin as like a

585
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,000
wise man

586
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,720
um is usually about telling a story

587
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
where

588
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:07,039
uh through cleverness uh

589
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,360
and sometimes agility

590
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,400
a character can outwit others who have

591
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,199
more power

592
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,400
we would otherwise exercise power over

593
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,799
them

594
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,000
i mean there are good tricksters in that

595
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,760
but um

596
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,200
you know we like to focus on the idea of

597
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,360
the good trickster

598
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,039
which is those who are fighting power

599
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,039
instead of those who are serving

600
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:32,158
power um so here's another example a

601
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:35,679
modest proposal this is a pamphlet

602
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,919
published by jonathan swift

603
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,679
where he suggested that the irish eat

604
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,760
their babies

605
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,919
um in order to solve the hunger problem

606
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,360
in ireland because of course

607
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:50,559
uh the potato famine was not a famine

608
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,439
that was caused by a lack of food in

609
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,840
that country

610
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,919
it was caused by lack of money as most

611
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,720
famines are

612
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,880
the british were still shipping grains

613
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,480
out of ireland because they made money

614
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,200
when people were starving to death

615
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,200
because the potato crops had failed

616
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,720
so um this is a comment on that well why

617
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,000
don't the irish just eat their own

618
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,799
babies

619
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,600
and uh then it was it's become one of

620
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,039
the most famous

621
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:20,000
examples of uh you know english

622
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,200
satire um in history and english

623
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,640
language that is

624
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,480
this is the 1700s so um the whole point

625
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,240
here is that this pamphlet

626
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,000
like a lot of the sort of hacking

627
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,080
techniques that we end up

628
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,159
using now this pamphlet was like

629
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,039
disguising itself as something else when

630
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:39,360
it was first published

631
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,879
um okay i'm going to skip ahead and

632
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,399
these are a few pictures of the women's

633
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,799
movement but i want to

634
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,000
get through this stuff quickly the whole

635
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,679
purpose here is to show

636
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,919
you that uh again this obsession with

637
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,520
stories with infiltrating with causing

638
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,919
um trouble which they did

639
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,960
is um is something that's constant has

640
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,080
continued to

641
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,080
to happen to occur

642
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,760
i'm showing at low power but i'm a power

643
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,400
problem

644
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,360
um i'm gonna have to go and get another

645
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,400
power supply because this one is

646
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,039
not working um but uh

647
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,600
this is a a group called climate rush

648
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,120
that was

649
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,600
uh that was repeating those actions um

650
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,600
so i'm gonna run off and get another

651
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,000
power supply i will be back in just a

652
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,678
moment

653
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,679
i'm going to leave you with a picture of

654
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,639
of gandhi's salt march now just a minute

655
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:40,000

656
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,480
uh srimati naidu who

657
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,039
is leading one of the salt marshes i'll

658
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,039
be right back

659
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,039

660
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:55,200
you that you can ask questions

661
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:58,158
at the hashtag rc31

662
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,679
one spelled out as a word on twitter and

663
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,360
mastered on

664
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,720
and also on the irc

665
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,840
[Music]

666
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:11,840
and now we all sing some songs together

667
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,840
and wait

668
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,840

ah they're good welcome back

670
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,039
thank you that's not the thing that i

671
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,879
expected to stop working

672
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,080
never had a power supply just stop in

673
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,679
the middle

674
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,120
okay well um anyway uh

675
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,440
i was also going to say that a lot of

676
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,719
the stuff that we got inspiration from

677
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,880
our comes from principles of

678
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,279
non-violence um

679
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,440
uh going where you're not supposed to go

680
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,840
crossing borders this is again trickster

681
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,320
tactics so the tactics of civil

682
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,480
disobedience

683
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,559
are the same kind of tactics that we use

684
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,159
when we uh infiltrate and do something

685
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,158
in a business meeting

686
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,840
um you know it's it's doing something

687
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,360
illegal something that

688
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:22,959
it is illegal but might of course have

689
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,439
uh just ends in mind um or might even be

690
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,840
the

691
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,559
right thing to do so the salt march in

692
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,039
india

693
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,240
um during the indian independence

694
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,039
movement

695
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,000
was where you know people marched to the

696
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,200
sea and

697
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,360
made salt which was

698
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,880
illegal because it was being taxed by

699
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,678
the british and it's one of the ways

700
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,919
that the

701
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:48,960
um the british crown was

702
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,039
suppressing uh the uh the local

703
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,000
populations and and preventing

704
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,600
uh india from having autonomy and from

705
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,640
being able to um

706
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:02,000
uh break the yoke of colonialism

707
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,640
so um again the idea was to try to

708
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,440
to um to cross those boundaries and to

709
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,880
do in a way

710
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:12,320
that um was visible to the world

711
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,960
um another example is the uh

712
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,559
bus protests in the united states during

713
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,159
the civil rights movement

714
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:22,960
this is a woman um actually

715
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,760
well before rosa parks who's this this

716
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,200
photo

717
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,480
here is of there was um this woman whose

718
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,600
last name is morgan

719
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,480
uh who this is over a decade earlier who

720
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,639
was

721
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,760
riding on the bus and refused to give up

722
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,760
her seat

723
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,679
and uh so there are many many people

724
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,600
doing these sorts of tactics which were

725
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,440
really about

726
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,600
crossing these borders crossing these

727
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,159
boundaries

728
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,120
all right i'm going to move ahead here

729
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:54,320
through a few smart slides

730
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:58,239
of occupations things like the american

731
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,000
indian movement that was uh

732
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,360
sorry this is indians of all tribes

733
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,240
occupying alcatraz

734
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,520
saying this is this space is ours this

735
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,640
is after the

736
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,720
prison had left the island this is just

737
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,399
off the coast of san francisco

738
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:17,760
in 1971 and again it's standing rock

739
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:20,559
same kinds of tactics occupation

740
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,840
refusing to move then getting moved by

741
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,840
the authorities

742
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,320
in a display of violence that shows uh

743
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,639
really um

744
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,120
that should in theory at least be

745
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,240
embarrassing for those wielding power

746
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,799
when they claim to be benevolent um

747
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,000
billboard alteration another simple

748
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,760
transgression

749
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,799
you know it's just like going up there

750
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,720
and uh changing a billboard

751
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,799
um street signs you can change the

752
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,480
street sign to malcolm x street which is

753
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,918
something that

754
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,279
in the early 90s i was doing in portland

755
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,159
oregon

756
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:59,440
and this was in protest of them uh not

757
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,039
naming a street from martin luther king

758
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,919
sometimes it's as simple as changing an

759
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:06,640
existing sign like hollyweed i show this

760
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,720
because it's a successful campaign

761
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,440
you know wheat is now pretty much legal

762
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,919
in uh well it's legal in california

763
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,240
and it will be soon probably in most of

764
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,279
the united states if not all

765
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,080
um and things like banner hangs

766
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,399
again going where you're not supposed to

767
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,240
getting your message there

768
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,600
um if you don't have the money for

769
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,880
banner you can

770
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,918
draw on a beach um you can put on a

771
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:37,559
costume like super barrio in mexico city

772
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:41,200
um this is after the earthquake in

773
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:44,639
1987 this guy showed up wearing a

774
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,679
wrestling outfit and um

775
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,799
demanded rights for the poor people uh

776
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:54,080
in mexico and the neighborhoods that

777
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:57,360
weren't being repaired by the government

778
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,279
and people loved him so much and the

779
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,120
media loved him so much

780
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,320
that when he started to challenge

781
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,559
political leaders to wrestling matches

782
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,000
um they kind of had to show up and talk

783
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,519
to him otherwise it would be very

784
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,360
embarrassing

785
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:15,760
so um this is uh an example of using

786
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,959
some kind of flamboyant tactic in plain

787
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,799
sight

788
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,360
um to go places you're not allowed to go

789
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,639
and then again the masked man the

790
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,879
identity here

791
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,840
uh for the zapatistas is sort of the

792
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,440
flip side of that

793
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:33,760
is the obscured identity um

794
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,440
you know wearing a mask because you have

795
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,399
to because you're actually

796
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,080
participating in an armed rebellion but

797
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,439
also

798
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,600
um this movement of the zapatistas was

799
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,640
really thinking very much about their

800
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,959
media image

801
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,080
and about presenting their revolution to

802
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,279
the world

803
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,960
and have any having it exist on a global

804
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,080
stage

805
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,799
oh and here's comandante ramona who's

806
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,760
the leader of the zapatistas with

807
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:04,960
subcomandante marcos

808
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:08,559
um and uh again thinking about

809
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:12,399
who who is in charge here it's uh

810
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:15,440
this is this um under five foot tall

811
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,959
indigenous elder who is running the

812
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,799
zapatista revolution

813
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:24,000
at the time in 1994. um

814
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,720
just one or two more slides here

815
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
of other things to put it all in context

816
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,519
here's a group called the space

817
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,240
hijackers uh with one of their tanks

818
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,080
they had as few they bought a few tanks

819
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,799
it turns out that in the uk it's not

820
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,360
that hard to buy them

821
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,799
and they dressed as the sort of comic

822
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,199
riot police

823
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,720
and this was sort of the clown car that

824
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,159
distracted the real

825
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,200
riot police who followed them

826
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,799
and then let their other tank roll right

827
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,799
into the largest

828
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:01,760
arms show in the world in london so

829
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:03,600
sometimes these plots involve decoys

830
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,679
involve many layers

831
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,439
in order to access these venues

832
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,080
this is a picture of a teddy bear

833
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:16,080
catapult the fun thing about this

834
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:19,360
this was at the ftaa protest

835
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,639
in uh in

836
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,199
quebec city in canada and the fun thing

837
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,760
about this

838
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,120
is that it created a dilemma for the

839
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,720
police

840
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,479
because the world leaders are meeting

841
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,200
inside the fortress city

842
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,559
literally it's the only fortress city in

843
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,640
north america

844
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,080
europe has a lot of them but this is at

845
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,039
the top of the hill there's a

846
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,080
fort in in quebec and that's where they

847
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,240
were meeting

848
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,480
and of course the anti-globalization

849
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,360
activists surrounded it and laid siege

850
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,880
to it

851
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:53,918
and one group um built this hilarious

852
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,360
catapult and was flinging teddy bears in

853
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,200
and the police were faced with the

854
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,039
decision do we arrest

855
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,240
do we stop the teddy bears from being

856
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,399
flung in

857
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,559
and we arrest the catapult and then look

858
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,959
ridiculous walking away with it

859
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,800
or do we let them keep flinging neither

860
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,520
option was a good one

861
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,079
they arrested the the the activists and

862
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,320
they

863
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,399
then you know then there's this

864
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,839
hilarious picture of them

865
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,319
hauling around a catapult with teddy

866
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,320
bears

867
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,079
if you can't make a catapult you don't

868
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,919
have the means maybe you

869
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,240
have some bread and you can strap it to

870
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:31,839
your head like at the uh

871
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:35,199
in the egyptian um the recent

872
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:36,879
revolution in the arab spring where

873
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,799
people were strapping all kinds of

874
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,359
things to their heads

875
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,159
to make a statement about the violence

876
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:46,000
that was being perpetrated against them

877
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,359
because of course the state was saying

878
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,359
that they were

879
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,560
creating the violence and the activists

880
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,319
were saying no we're

881
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,000
we we don't even have helmets you're

882
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,839
just you're we're going to just strap

883
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,040
whatever we have to our head

884
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:01,200
um and it became a hilarious

885
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,279
living meme where people are walking

886
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,879
around with all kinds of crazy

887
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,920
makeshift helmets um one more

888
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,079
image the flying penis that attacked

889
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,880
gary kasparov and

890
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,440
i think what became a very popular uh

891
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,440
viral video for its moment

892
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,640
and you can look this up but this is

893
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,079
also a warning

894
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:27,118
because this phallus which is flying

895
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,880
it's like an rc helicopter with a dildo

896
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,800
attached to it

897
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,119
and this thing which was flown against

898
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,680
kasparov who was at the time

899
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,960
the strongest opposition candidate to

900
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,839
putin

901
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,160
could very well be the kgbs flying

902
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,720
phallus so everybody uses these tactics

903
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,240
and i say that because you know it was

904
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,560
it became a really popular and

905
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,680
embarrassing video that was

906
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,920
um against kasparov it was

907
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,359
and so you know who knows who was who

908
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,839
was behind it

909
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,839
who was at the controls um

910
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,160
so to go back to what we do with the yes

911
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,560
men we are not beneath

912
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,319
a few phallic metaphors ourselves

913
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,599
because it works really well when you're

914
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,880
trying to um

915
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:16,960
impersonate people in power

916
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,880
this is an example of one time when we

917
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,359
went to a conference in finland

918
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:26,000
representing the wto

919
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:29,839
and announced that the wto solution

920
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,760
to the problem of sweatshops

921
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,160
was this thing called the employee

922
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,200
visualization appendage

923
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,240
um which was a three foot long palace

924
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,359
that had a

925
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,319
kind of heads-up display

926
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,720
on it that allowed you to um give to see

927
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,280
your

928
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,279
remote workers anywhere in the world and

929
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,520
give them electric shock

930
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,800
um and of course the audience loved it

931
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,960
because

932
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,720
because we were they thought we were the

933
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,560
most powerful people in the room at the

934
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,959
beginning of the talk

935
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,880
we were wearing uh business suits and we

936
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,720
made a breakaway business seat that i

937
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,640
could tear off of andy

938
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:12,000
in one quick movement and then this uh

939
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:16,319
three foot long um inflatable

940
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,960
phallus was uh instantly deployed with a

941
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,480
co2 cartridge so it inflated in a matter

942
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,599
of

943
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,960
maybe a second and a half and this

944
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,359
is uh a story from from the newspaper

945
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,119
the

946
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:33,920
second largest daily in finland um that

947
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,440
sort of explains a little bit about

948
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,320
about the

949
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:45,440
the wto's plans um

950
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:49,280
so uh i don't know how well you can see

951
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:52,079
those videos um that

952
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,839
can i get a little feedback on that um

953
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,079
can anybody tell me how easy it was to

954
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:58,640
see some of the video

955
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,079
it looked okay the sound was great and

956
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,640
the video was very

957
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,000
stuttery but you could do it okay so

958
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,879
i'll show a little bit more

959
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,400
video i'm gonna actually show i'm gonna

960
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,160
skip this one this is

961
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,839
this is a time that we this is probably

962
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,560
the most famous of the things that we've

963
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,400
done

964
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,320
it's in our second film which is called

965
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,760
the yes men

966
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,560
uh our the yes men fix the world

967
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,359
and you can find that that's on the

968
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,480
wherever

969
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:29,920
youtube other places um

970
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,960
file sharing and uh this is where andy

971
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,520
was representing

972
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:37,839
um the he was representing dow chemical

973
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,599
on a live television broadcast on the

974
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:42,960
20th anniversary of the bopal

975
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:45,520
catastrophe and uh as

976
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,520
dow chemical he took responsibility for

977
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,560
the disaster and offered

978
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,240
to pay back the the victims uh and meet

979
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,880
their demands and clean up the plant

980
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,160
site

981
00:38:52,880 --> 00:39:00,480
so sometimes we use that tactic where we

982
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,960
um if we're given enough power

983
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,000
and we have the right platform it's

984
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,359
incredibly

985
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
uh useful to announce a sort of utopian

986
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,240
solution

987
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,160
or to announce that the company that

988
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,000
you're targeting is meeting the demands

989
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,598
that activists have been asking for for

990
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,640
years because then it puts the company

991
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,800
in a real dilemma they have no good

992
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,520
choice they either have to say

993
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,680
that wasn't us and we are not fixing the

994
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,839
problem that we created

995
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,839
or if they ignore it then they have this

996
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,520
disinformation out there

997
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,520
in the universe it means that they have

998
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:39,599
to they have to act

999
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:42,880
um so i'm gonna i'm gonna skip that

1000
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,880
and i'm gonna go to this which is a more

1001
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,359
slightly more recent thing this is also

1002
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,839
pretty old though this is i think

1003
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,759
in our last yes men moving called the

1004
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:56,000
yes men are revolting

1005
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:59,280
and what we're doing here is uh creating

1006
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,640
a replica of the

1007
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,800
stage um at the tooth

1008
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,920
the copenhagen climate conference so

1009
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,680
this is 2009 the cop 15.

1010
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,200
and um the reason we just wanted to

1011
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,440
create and

1012
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,319
something that looked enough like it so

1013
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,480
that we could make

1014
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,599
internet videos to embed in our fake

1015
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,079
website

1016
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,880
that would allow us to make

1017
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,319
announcements

1018
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:27,520
as the cop15 that would i mean as the

1019
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:29,599
official climate conference on behalf of

1020
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,640
canada and uganda and i'm going to play

1021
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,640
a little video here

1022
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,899
i think

1023
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,899
[Music]

1024
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,119
well while terry was looking through

1025
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,880
those documents the world was

1026
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,680
laughing at canada because of another

1027
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,480
one it surfaced as a press release

1028
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:51,440
or so everyone believed but soon it was

1029
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,480
clear canada had been

1030
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,800
leslie mckinnon reports

1031
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,680
first there was this demo inside

1032
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,920
parliament

1033
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,598
20 years ago protesters who caused a

1034
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,560
minor stir

1035
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,960
than this green peas caper but that got

1036
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,400
mostly reported as a reach of security

1037
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,800
story

1038
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,440
neither managed to get canada's climate

1039
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,800
policy as much attention in copenhagen

1040
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:19,280
as today's multi-layered hoax

1041
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,440
the day began with this press release

1042
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,920
announcing the astonishing news

1043
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,520
that canada was suddenly doubling its

1044
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,599
emissions cuts to

1045
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:32,880
40 below 1990 levels by 2020

1046
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:36,000
and that it would generously pony up

1047
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,839
13 billion dollars to be allocated to

1048
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,040
the african countries for emissions

1049
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,200
reduction

1050
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,720
then there was this article about it on

1051
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,480
what looked like the wall street

1052
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,439
journal's website

1053
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,160
you see then this is a news conference

1054
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,440
purportedly by the ugandan delegates

1055
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,759
posted on what looked like the

1056
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:57,599
copenhagen conference website

1057
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,760
dearest it looked amazingly real

1058
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,720
until the speaker compared canada's oil

1059
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,040
reserves

1060
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,560
to a loaded gun and steamed ready to

1061
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,680
pull the trigger on millions of us

1062
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:10,400
around the globe you left us no choice

1063
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,640
but to see you as criminal but a press

1064
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,720
release from environment canada followed

1065
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,078
that seemingly deplored the spoof

1066
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,520
releases and false

1067
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:22,560
hopes this turned out to be a hoax

1068
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,920
in fact it was all a hoax

1069
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,359
it's a game but it's not a game it's a

1070
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,000
serious issue you're playing games i'm

1071
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,160
not playing

1072
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,920
however truth can be stranger than

1073
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,759
fiction this is the prime minister's

1074
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,720
spokesman i'm exclaiming the stunt on

1075
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,800
stephen gilbo

1076
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,160
of the environment group equiter and i

1077
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,640
want an apology

1078
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,000
and this is also the real thing i was in

1079
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,118
the plenary session at the time that

1080
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,880
this happened and i

1081
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,400
really can't comment any further why is

1082
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,040
it a hoax that canada is going to do the

1083
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,119
right thing

1084
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,400
this environmentalist thinks the whole

1085
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,560
elaborate joke

1086
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,319
forced i had nothing to do with this one

1087
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,078
but i'm really happy that they did it

1088
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,680
as to who pulled this off there are

1089
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,599
reports tonight it's a group of

1090
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,319
pranksters who call themselves the yes

1091
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,000
men

1092
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:03,119
they say they'll have a press conference

1093
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,160
tomorrow if you can believe that

1094
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:08,240
leslie mckinnon cbc news ottawa

1095
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,560
well on climate-related stunt is one of

1096
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:13,359
many that have happened lately

1097
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,400
okay so uh just to to wrap that little

1098
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,480
thing up

1099
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,560
you can see here that we're just in a

1100
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,319
basement basically

1101
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,880
these microphones are just made out of

1102
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:25,920
pipe cleaners and electrical tape

1103
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,400
uh we printed out a bunch of um you know

1104
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,480
we had to make our own teleprompter

1105
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,200
print out a bunch of the logos and put

1106
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,680
paste them up on the wall

1107
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,879
um we used the reverse shots of the

1108
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,440
audience

1109
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,240
for the videos from other videos that we

1110
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,880
found already on their website

1111
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,560
and it created this uh kind of illusion

1112
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,480
where we could do both the big

1113
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,599
conference room and the press briefing

1114
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:54,480
room fairly easily

1115
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,160
so we made several videos and then

1116
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,440
eventually we had the press conference

1117
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,640
the next day

1118
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,200
uh which highlighted mostly the position

1119
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,160
of the

1120
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,480
ugandan uh participants in this project

1121
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,560
in particular kadili

1122
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,599
chandia who's there uh sitting in the

1123
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,359
middle in

1124
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:16,800
that uh red suit so um

1125
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:18,480
i just wanted to show that because uh

1126
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,839
it's really interesting that's again

1127
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,160
it's 10 years old

1128
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,960
and um it was effective at the moment at

1129
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,319
that moment

1130
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,280
and there weren't a lot of people

1131
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,640
talking about um fake news at that at

1132
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,000
that time

1133
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:33,680
um but something that

1134
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,839
people are really concerned about now is

1135
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,118
whether these tactics work anymore and i

1136
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,960
think it just depends

1137
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,319
uh on the context we found that

1138
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,760
sometimes they work really well

1139
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:45,599
in fact we had a successful action a few

1140
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,920
weeks ago that got a lot of attention

1141
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,480
for the bank of england's

1142
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,800
fiscal policy um but they don't really

1143
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,359
work very well against the rogue head of

1144
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,599
state

1145
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:57,200
like uh donald trump or something like

1146
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,720
there's no amount of

1147
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,520
satire or um kind of like

1148
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,000
uh utopian thinking that can that can

1149
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,280
work

1150
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:11,119
on that on that kind of wild card

1151
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:14,319
um so just to end the talking part

1152
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:16,800
um or the ranting part uh this here we

1153
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:19,920
have an image of renard the fox

1154
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,880
which is of course uh

1155
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,640
something i'd like to leave you with and

1156
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,640
i think getting in touch with all of our

1157
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,759
trickster roots is a good thing to do

1158
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,598
because when we

1159
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,920
find the roots we also find that we have

1160
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:33,359
common ground with everybody else who

1161
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,720
has trickster characters

1162
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:38,160
in their cultural histories um and this

1163
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:41,040
is uh

1164
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,759
remember uh confused only confused from

1165
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,599
below

1166
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:48,960
this is one of our primary tenets

1167
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,319
of confusionism and we've started school

1168
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,359
called the trickster academy

1169
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:55,279
we can talk about that later okay i'm

1170
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:59,040
going to stop sharing

1171
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:02,160
and all right

1172
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,240
i think i'm back great all right

1173
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,160
took so long i just that's okay uh you

1174
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,279
had a lot of interesting stuff to say

1175
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,440
i got ambitious with pen saying things

1176
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,560
and i think the phrase the kgb is flying

1177
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:17,200
phallus as one for the ages

1178
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,839
yeah yeah i mean maybe the phallus

1179
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,919
people are

1180
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,759
listen are here now and can come forward

1181
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,760
and ask a question or tell us

1182
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:29,280
who they are but uh as far as i know

1183
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:31,760
nobody knows it could still be the kgb

1184
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,359
all right we have the first questions

1185
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,400
questions

1186
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:38,640
why are you guys always such [ __ ]

1187
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,319
yeah yeah that's a that's a really good

1188
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,680
question we are always

1189
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:47,599
such [ __ ] um because we don't

1190
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:50,640
care about what people think about us

1191
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:52,000
i was once at a party where me and my

1192
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,440
brother had built this giant

1193
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,040
tower of chairs in in the swimming pool

1194
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,640
because it was like this fancy place we

1195
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,359
didn't get to go to fancy places like

1196
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,598
that

1197
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,400
and we dive off the giant tower of

1198
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,160
chairs

1199
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,000
it was great fun we thought we knew how

1200
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,520
to have a party but apparently people

1201
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,680
were really offended

1202
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,680
and then somebody lost their golden

1203
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,759
necklace in the pool

1204
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,680
and so we of course were swimming and we

1205
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,720
went and found it

1206
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:21,118
for the guy and he was so excited and so

1207
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,040
overjoyed he said

1208
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,640
i don't care what everybody else thinks

1209
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,480
you guys are okay

1210
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,558
so i've always remembered that word of

1211
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,040
wisdom and i thought okay

1212
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,079
our goal is not to make friends with

1213
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,400
people

1214
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,240
our goal is to get to that place in fact

1215
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,440
we can be the fall guy for a big

1216
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,598
organization

1217
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,880
that's worried about the reputation so

1218
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,960
like if

1219
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,240
the sierra club big environmental

1220
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,079
organization

1221
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,919
wants to use the kind of tactics that we

1222
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,160
do but is worried that their membership

1223
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,720
will get if be

1224
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,118
unpleased then they can get in touch

1225
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,200
with us and we'll do it for them

1226
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,119
so that's uh how you financed working on

1227
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,759
the yes man full time

1228
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,800
uh i actually financed it by working at

1229
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,960
a university

1230
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,720
so i'm i still teach at university but

1231
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,000
uh jacques more than i

1232
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,480
has financed it through things like that

1233
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,160
and

1234
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,800
and some of the actions quite a few of

1235
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:17,920
the actions have been financed by

1236
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,599
by large ngos like the green pieces of

1237
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,240
the world

1238
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,440
nice so people on the internet want to

1239
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:27,118
know if you've ever

1240
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:29,440
had to go to jail for your actions

1241
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:32,559
i've never had to go to jail for these

1242
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,559
kinds of actions

1243
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,520
well you went to jail for unrelated

1244
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,559
reasons i went i went to jail for ice

1245
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,119
skating once

1246
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,839
i was just like come on new york city

1247
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,119
like just

1248
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:48,240
you know i highly recommend ice skating

1249
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:50,160
on prospect park lake

1250
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,598
it was originally built for ice skating

1251
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,680
you know there's pictures of hundreds of

1252
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:56,240
people doing it in the 19th century

1253
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,520
but if you do it now you get arrested

1254
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,959
and they actually take you in

1255
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,440
overnight so you get to spend a night in

1256
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,559
jail

1257
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,839
which by the way

1258
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:09,920
is a very it's not exclusive but it's

1259
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:14,078
expensive it costs the taxpayers

1260
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:17,040
1 700 per night it's a pretty good hotel

1261
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,559
for this kind of money yes yes you could

1262
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,119
it's like a

1263
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,119
five star

1264
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,480
um so did you did you read

1265
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,319
any book about social engineering or did

1266
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,000
you just wing it until you figured out

1267
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,240
all the tricks

1268
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,319
it was sort of yeah it was like reverse

1269
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,720
engineering the social engineering for

1270
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:38,880
us

1271
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:42,799
because it was uh figuring it out

1272
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:46,640
as we went but then starting to discover

1273
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:49,359
a world of people doing things and

1274
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,680
um yeah reading about it so and there

1275
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,558
are so many people doing so many amazing

1276
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,160
things i mean

1277
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,680
i'm loving following some of these

1278
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,200
people now and even

1279
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:02,078
youtubers who do stuff like this is uh

1280
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,799
um so yeah it's but there are a few

1281
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:05,440
books

1282
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,280
i'm reading a great book about early con

1283
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,000
men right now that's really fun it's

1284
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,520
like uh

1285
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,359
i can't remember the title i'd have to

1286
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,839
grab it to read the title

1287
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:15,359
but yeah constantly uh constant

1288
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:18,558
education

1289
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:21,040
and also i think it's necessary also to

1290
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:22,800
always have innovation

1291
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,359
you know but but ultimately it seems

1292
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,119
like it does boil down to some to one

1293
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:30,480
thing

1294
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:33,440
and that is understanding what somebody

1295
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,880
wants right like if you know who you're

1296
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,440
talking to

1297
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,400
and you know what they want then you can

1298
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,440
build a world that delivers it to them

1299
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,800
and that seems to deliver to them the

1300
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,760
thing that they desire

1301
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,480
and that is that usually works really

1302
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,680
well

1303
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:55,839
you know it's it's uh even on people who

1304
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,839
are expecting it

1305
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,960
all right the next one is a trivia

1306
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,920
question which i really enjoy as a

1307
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,079
concept

1308
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,760
what are the top three most impactful

1309
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:07,680
events in world history that you can

1310
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:10,880
summarize in the fewest words possible

1311
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:14,000
sounds like a game show i like it

1312
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:17,599
top three fewest words

1313
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,880
in in human history in the world history

1314
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:24,079
in world history so i guess it can

1315
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:27,280
include geological events before humans

1316
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:29,599
yeah i kind of want to say

1317
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,400
you know big bang even though i don't

1318
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,480
know

1319
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,839
um that's what i've been told i don't

1320
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,720
totally really understand it but uh big

1321
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:39,680
bang

1322
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:41,200
how many words am i left i think as few

1323
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:46,078
as possible

1324
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:46,078
big bang asteroid

1325
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:53,920
anthropocene very good

1326
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:56,240
i'm sure you won whatever the game was

1327
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,240
i feel like i won i feel great about

1328
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,000
that answer

1329
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,000
how how did you guys come up with the

1330
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,680
human candle idea and maybe explain the

1331
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,240
human candle idea

1332
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,319
so the human candle idea was actually

1333
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,439
this goes back to the very first slide

1334
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,920
thanks for the call back

1335
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,960
when um i'm holding up the business card

1336
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,960

00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:47,599
claimed those from a pr

1349
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:50,319
agency got in touch with the people

1350
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,160
running the conference i had a domain

1351
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:54,160
name that looked like

1352
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,078
hillary knowlton or burson marsteller i

1353
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,118
can't remember who one of the big pr

1354
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:03,359
companies that tends to do this kind of

1355
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:06,720
level you know bullshitting

1356
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:07,359
and so uh i promised them that lee

1357
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,279
raymond

1358
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,480
had a very important announcement to

1359
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,240
make that would really put their

1360
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,480
converts on the map

1361
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,839
and of course they were excited about it

1362
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,000
but then

1363
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:20,480
this is the the tricky part at that

1364
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,720
point i had to tell them that

1365
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,520
you know they had to keep it secret

1366
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,118
until

1367
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:29,599
just before the the announcement because

1368
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:32,319
what he was going to say had such

1369
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:35,040
repercussions for the global economy

1370
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:35,920
that they could very well be breaking

1371
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,960
various kinds of

1372
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,359
sec that's like stock market laws

1373
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,040
if they didn't embargo the information

1374
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:44,240
so i said this is important you're part

1375
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,720
of

1376
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:48,640
a web of you know you're part of a

1377
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,078
bubble of secrecy we have to maintain

1378
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,839
the secret because

1379
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:53,119
as soon as people know that he's going

1380
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,880
to make a big announcement they're going

1381
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,800
to freak out because he had a new

1382
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,960
position with the government

1383
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,920
and so they they bought it and in fact

1384
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,800
this is one of those

1385
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,400
counter-intuitive things where you would

1386
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,240
think that telling them

1387
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,079
that you have this great honey pot for

1388
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,520
their conference this guy who

1389
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:13,839
other people are going to register to

1390
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,839
see at their conference

1391
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,480
you think that that then when you tell

1392
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:21,599
them that they can't tell anyone

1393
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,200
that it would be immediately blow you up

1394
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,079
but it doesn't because they feel like

1395
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,118
they're on the inside

1396
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:30,000
of something big then and so they

1397
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:31,839
kept the secret and then what we decided

1398
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,520
we were going to announce was that exxon

1399
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:36,558
mobil

1400
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,759
had a climate change solution which was

1401
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,520
to turn

1402
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:45,280
the humans uh who died as a result

1403
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:46,880
of climate change into a new biofuel

1404
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,119
called vivolium

1405
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,880
and so we had an animated thing it's in

1406
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,680
our second movie the yes man fixed the

1407
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,400
world

1408
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,799
but that idea came from us thinking

1409
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,839
about what is the logical extension

1410
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:02,000
of exxon mobil's climate policy because

1411
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:05,359
at the time it had just been revealed

1412
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:08,400
that exxon mobil had done all of this

1413
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:11,759
very shady uh

1414
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,359
suppression of knowledge about the um

1415
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,599
about climate change excellent mobile

1416
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:18,799
had scientists working for them

1417
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,200
in the 70s that knew that climate change

1418
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:22,160
was

1419
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,799
a huge problem and they had decided to

1420
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:27,440
suppress the information themselves

1421
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:28,559
and then they went on a protracted

1422
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,480
campaign

1423
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:32,559
of suppressing the information at the

1424
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,799
federal level in the united states

1425
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,839
and at the global level so they became

1426
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:38,000
the target

1427
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:39,119
and this announcement became the uh what

1428
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,799
we were going to do and then of course

1429
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,839
when we're at the conference

1430
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:47,200
at the very last minute lee raymond's

1431
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:49,200
the former ceo of exxonmobil who's now

1432
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,319
has a federal position with the us

1433
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,118
government

1434
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:55,119
doesn't show up and a substitute takes

1435
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,839
his place on the stage

1436
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:59,040
and that's yeah so what did i answer the

1437
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,040
question i can't remember

1438
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,400
i think someone wanted to know how you

1439
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,000
came up with the idea

1440
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,079
but yeah that's always difficult to

1441
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,920
answer right yeah i think it was really

1442
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:11,040
just shooting the [ __ ] as they say

1443
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,680
with uh with some friends and as a as i

1444
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,558
remember was

1445
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,118
a guy called bob ostertag who worked

1446
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:19,280
with us

1447
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:22,480
for a while who uh is actually a uh

1448
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:24,880
more of like a musician and a uh

1449
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,079
you know anyway he he was the one i

1450
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,440
think who

1451
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:32,160
who really pushed that idea forward and

1452
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,640
it turned out to be a really fun one i

1453
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,240
mean it's

1454
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,640
basically a direct callback to the

1455
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:40,160
jonathan swift stuff right so you're

1456
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:43,200
really getting very into people's

1457
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:46,160
people's bodies it is it's a classic

1458
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,960
i mean babies people eating them

1459
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,078
cannibalism

1460
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,280
i mean these are like you know they they

1461
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:54,480
hit you they hit you

1462
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:57,760
right where right where you feel it

1463
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,839
yeah all right another question is

1464
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,760
do you worry at all that your campaigns

1465
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:03,119
erode trust in the media

1466
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,359
or do you just think that they should

1467
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:07,200
maybe pay some more attention

1468
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:09,279
yeah no we don't worry about that at all

1469
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,160
i mean it's it's weird because for a

1470
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,079
while

1471
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,520
there was something to worry about there

1472
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:16,559
because people's

1473
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:18,720
you know trust in the media i mean that

1474
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,000
now it's just a it's just a weird

1475
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:23,439
landscape totally

1476
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,480
bizarre um i mean in terms of what

1477
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,240
people believe or don't believe

1478
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,559
one of the things that we do all the

1479
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:33,919
time though is reveal

1480
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:36,720
our hoaxes immediately after we

1481
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,680
perpetrate them and so the result is

1482
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:41,919
that there is actually

1483
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:44,799
more information um as opposed to

1484
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,720
uh you know what we see as fake news

1485
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:47,520
which is people who are perpetrating a

1486
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,000
hoax

1487
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,720
and they mean for it to exist for

1488
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,119
eternity

1489
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,680
ideally like if you create a falsehood

1490
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:58,240
and you're not revealing it

1491
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:01,359
that's the type of thing that the

1492
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:04,558
advertising in this industry

1493
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:08,640
pr agencies have done and governments

1494
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:10,400
have done for centuries um but our types

1495
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,790
of hoaxes are meant to be revealed right

1496
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,599
away

1497
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:15,759
[Music]

1498
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:16,720
all right i have a mysterious question

1499
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,400
yes

1500
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,839
oh okay now i understand what are your

1501
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,200
thoughts about the orange man

1502
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:23,680
and i've just realized that that's

1503
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,799
donald trump oh

1504
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,799
you know i don't know if i would have

1505
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:28,000
gotten just the unrelated orange person

1506
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:29,520
if you know any

1507
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,680
yeah i mean it's confusing for me

1508
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,400
because an orange man i start thinking

1509
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,240
about

1510
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:38,079
poland and about there's all kinds of

1511
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:41,359
orange people here and there but uh

1512
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:42,640

nothing that wrong with it

1528
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:18,160
is there a reason you don't have a bulb

1529
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:22,569
in your socket on your ceiling

1530
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:24,240
yeah it's because i moved it to here

1531
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:27,440
[Laughter]

1532

1534
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,040

thanks for that question i like it oh

1538
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,359
yeah that's interesting

1539
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:45,200
can we trace the lineage of the thai

1540
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:47,440
rubber ducks and the chinese umbrellas

1541
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:50,960
back to that taped bread

1542
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:54,000
i think it's about these helmets yes yes

1543
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,760
definitely i don't know actually if

1544
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:00,559
anybody can do that

1545
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:03,680
do let me know um the empty bulb though

1546
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:06,559
i'm putting my finger on right now here

1547
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,919
um reminds me though that this is like

1548
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:10,400
another you know i i

1549
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,200
remember the cia sabotage manual that

1550
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,319
they were dropping

1551
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:15,839
on el salvador um i'm actually not

1552
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:17,440
nicaragua sorry

1553
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:19,520
where they were encouraging people to

1554
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,359
like sabotage

1555
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,880
everywhere because at the time it was

1556
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:25,359
you know

1557
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,240
communist and so the idea was that if if

1558
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:28,319
people broke

1559
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,680
everything then the country would come

1560
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:32,000
to a stand still

1561
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,040
so they suggested things like taking the

1562
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,559
light bulb out

1563
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:37,040
and putting a coin in there and putting

1564
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:39,440
the light bulb back in so

1565
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,400
i i don't know you know everybody uses

1566
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:44,720
these tactics

1567
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:47,599
it's again thinking about uh

1568
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,959
about the cia's flying flying penis you

1569
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:54,240
know

1570
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:56,000
the sound yeah cia sabotage manuals

1571
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,000
uh maybe one last question do you have

1572
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,920
any projects in the pipeline

1573
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,839
i mean i assume you don't want to talk

1574
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,839
about them but you can

1575
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:05,200
you know we have a movie about walls

1576
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:08,240
that we're working on

1577
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,720
um but it's it took we took a hiatus you

1578
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,078
know

1579
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,879
with covid and uh we have a whole bunch

1580
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:14,720
of other

1581
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,160
things that are in the works some of

1582
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,160
them we're doing independently

1583
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,200
not as the yes men but i'm doing stuff

1584
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:22,960
and uh

1585
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:25,439
andy is doing stuff and um yeah we're

1586
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,640
also always trying to recalibrate

1587
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,520
because

1588
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,558
you know the the terrain is changing so

1589
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,119
quickly

1590
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:34,640
and it's such a strange and interesting

1591
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,400
moment

1592
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,558
particularly in the united states but

1593
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,720
also all over the world

1594
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:42,480
yeah there's a i mean there's many

1595
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:45,520
questions along the lines of

1596
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:47,440
like how do you feel about satire

1597
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,359
in this year when it just seems like

1598
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:51,760
half the news is satire

1599
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:52,799
right or at least it feels just

1600
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,599
completely

1601
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:56,720
unhinged right yeah and i don't think a

1602
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:58,960
lot of times it doesn't

1603
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,759
i don't think satire about donald trump

1604
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,039
works

1605
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,760
i didn't even think that any of the

1606
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:04,559
stuff that was on saturday night live

1607
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,400
was funny

1608
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:08,079
you know where they impersonate the

1609
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,200
people in the administration it's just

1610
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:12,000
like

1611
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,480
worse versions of the real thing that's

1612
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,880
really

1613
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,640
funny if you could actually laugh about

1614
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,799
it if it wasn't real

1615
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:21,038
um i mean it must have been the same

1616
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:22,640
like looking at hitler in the in the 30s

1617
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:24,640
you know like you probably look at that

1618
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,558
and think this can't be real

1619
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,759
but you know it's here's this crazy

1620
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,960
looking guy doing

1621
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,599
saying crazy [ __ ] uh and so then what do

1622
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,680
you do

1623
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:35,920
and i think that you you choose

1624
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:38,078
different tactics for a while

1625
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,760
but you fight it seems like the funniest

1626
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,000
thing to do for him but to just

1627
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,880
pretend he's giving a coherent speech

1628
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,119
right

1629
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:49,920
totally yeah i mean it's like

1630
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:52,480
he keeps out doing himself what happened

1631
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:55,520
in the final weeks of the campaign

1632
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,799
and just after with giuliani and the

1633
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:59,440
four seasons

1634
01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:00,400
total landscaping and the face melting

1635
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,319
off and the

1636
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,760
i mean there was so many things where

1637
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:07,038
you just like the levels

1638
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:10,400
of crazy theater were

1639
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:12,319
oh man i yeah anyway i mean you could

1640
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,839
have definitely just claimed that as a

1641
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:18,319
yes man stunt

1642
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:20,078
definitely it was a stroke of genius

1643
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:22,079
that

1644
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:24,160
yes all right maybe a last question do

1645
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:27,280
you have any any things that failed

1646
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:30,160
spectacularly that you are yeah

1647
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:32,880
to reveal to them yes we have many

1648
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:34,720
things that have failed spectacularly

1649
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,920
and uh there are some of them that you

1650
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,279
can read about on the

1651
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,920
yes men website which is at the

1652
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,000
yesmen.org

1653
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,280
and one in particular that i recommend

1654
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,880
reading about

1655
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:49,119
that we documented at least in text is

1656
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,960
an event where we impersonated a group

1657
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:54,079
called the international

1658
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:56,079
web police claimed to be securing the

1659
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:59,680
internet this was back in the

1660
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:02,400
late 90s or around 2002 or something

1661
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,759
anyway it was a it was a funny event and

1662
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:07,280
uh

1663
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:12,000
yes i'm not going to get into it here

1664
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:15,920
but it amuses me just to think about it

1665
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,319

01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:41,839
