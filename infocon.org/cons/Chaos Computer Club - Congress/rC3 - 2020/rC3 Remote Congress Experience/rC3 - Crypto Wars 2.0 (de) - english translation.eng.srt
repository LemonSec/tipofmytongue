3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,480
and now

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,480
the talk five ai fbi europol

5
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:28,160
these organizations have been trying to

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,198
abolish end-to-end encryption

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:35,680
and this talk from eric mclare

8
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,360
will give us an insight in this world

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,320
describing what has been happening in

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,600
the last five years

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,879
and he will also explain what will

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,280
happen in the next couple of days

13
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,160
especially last two months have been

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,640
very

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,639
intense

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,840
i greet all of you all of the ladies and

17
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,000
gentlemen

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:07,040
so let's go right into the middle of it

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,560
you probably have noticed

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:14,000
those pushes by

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,680
the um parliament to

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,799
get rid of end-to-end encryption from

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,920
the net

24
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:26,880
again and

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:30,640
talk i have packaged

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,920
this talk into several articles

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,360
that i wrote but they're over time

28
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:41,840
so let's

29
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,840
start with something very current

30
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,759
there was a resolution that was not

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,960
apparently non-binding or at least

32
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,960
that's what they claimed

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,399
it has already spawned off a new

34
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:03,360
um implementation law

35
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,719
like an ordinance so a non-binding

36
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,038
resolution by the

37
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:12,480
by the um the commission

38
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:16,160
was already put into an ordinance

39
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:22,238
so it's about a super secure

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:23,840
um encryption standard that they have

41
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,879
and it's the same all the time for the

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:31,120
eu there's a non-binding resolution

43
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,120
and there's another decision

44
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:40,080
by the council and this is the

45
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,079
the normal process

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,879
at this stage in the process

47
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,839
already this is being tied into other

48
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,839
legislation that is happening right now

49
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:05,840
this is concerning the high security

50
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,840
encryption standards

51
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,958
a reenactment of orwell again

52
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,319
and i want to show you today that this

53
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:32,159
basically didn't come out of thin air

54
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:35,920
it was already started in 2014

55
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,599
and i want to refer to the

56
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,958
basically the history of it that was

57
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,959
laid down by net politics

58
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,840
matthias monroy basically laid down

59
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,840
a similar timeline

60
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,599
a very granular fine finely detailed

61
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,399
history of the the whole affair

62
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,000
whereas i want to do a high level bird's

63
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,400
eye view over the whole process

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,680
and beginning 2014

65
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,920
everybody's um yeah running around like

66
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,920
chicken

67
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,839
diagram shows the network traffic

68
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,639
it wasn't even the third and before that

69
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,320
it was even less

70
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,199
so it was the leaks by snowden

71
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,639
that the golden age of monitoring in the

72
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,720
internet

73
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:40,840
stopped and

74
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,840
the global siphoning off of data in the

75
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
internet

76
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,400
the encryption increased massively and

77
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,360
then

78
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,080
police had a major issue because they

79
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,400
used to

80
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,280
take a lot of data from the telephone

81
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:11,840
networks

82
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:11,840
metadata content

83
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:22,240
a judge and they were allowed to

84
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:26,719
take anything out that they could find

85
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:31,759
and now we're going where it started

86
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,759
it wasn't in europe it was in the usa

87
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,000
for example the w3c the hardening of the

88
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,680
internet the

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,720
tls the itf they've been pushing

90
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,360
encryption back then and in the time

91
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,840
after

92
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,000
snowden there was a bit of a break where

93
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,758
um legislation about surveillance wasn't

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,440
very popular

95
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,080
and they basically all went at it at the

96
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:06,000
same time

97
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:09,599
europol gchq fbi directors

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,400
in the usa and another one

99
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,120
who i'm going to talk about later they

100
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,159
all said

101
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,639
we need access to encrypted

102
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,039
communication

103
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,400
even including mobile phones because we

104
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,419
cannot do our work

105
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,508
without it

106
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,509
[Music]

107
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,160
the crypto plugin for the w3c browser

108
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,240
was already ready

109
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,520
it was the the foundation for the

110
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:43,199
encryption

111
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:45,200
on the web mac then and 2015 there was

112
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,840
a few eu

113
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,680
[Music]

114
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,599
council um

115
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,960
commissions that said we need secure

116
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,560
encryption which basically went the

117
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,520
opposite direction of what the others

118
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:03,120
were saying

119
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:06,560
yes in february

120
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:10,880
and the eu council

121
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,880
dealt with it in the year 2015.

122
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,000
they wanted to weaken encryption

123
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,919
and in these two years

124
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,039
there was there was this guy

125
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:31,840
nsa director rogers

126
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,840
came out from the dark and

127
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:41,520
he said that

128
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,520
there is there was this um

129
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:49,520
assassins that could not be um

130
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,960
caught because they couldn't hack the

131
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,520
phone

132
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,960
and there that was when the first

133
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,840
technical

134
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,840
problems occurred

135
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,639
it was discovered that there was this um

136
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:12,878
security vulnerability called freak

137
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:15,919
that was used by the nsa

138
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,160
that and that was used to

139
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,159
um

140
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,599
and the detection was really um

141
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,360
embarrassing because the nsa was asking

142
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,919
for this

143
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,120
which and this happened and and those of

144
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,279
you who were

145
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:39,360
part of the first crypto wars know that

146
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:43,039
this was an issue back then

147
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:47,279
if you look at these um ratings

148
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:50,080
you see that this browser has

149
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,080
supporting these

150
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,839
technologies and

151
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,519
and there was this old rc4

152
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,279
key which was really obsolete totally

153
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,560
outdated

154
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,680
but it was still supported

155
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:17,279
and that was a really um

156
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,279
embarrassing moment for the nsa

157
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,440
october 2015

158
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,440
let's encrypt was

159
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,200
yeah the let's encrypt certificates were

160
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,040
recognized by all

161
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,920
major browsers that was an enormous

162
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,069
um push against the nsa

163
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,069
[Music]

164
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,760
directly after the revelations by

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,959
snowden

166
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,720
um let's encrypt has been founded

167
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:54,079
the fba campaign that said

168
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,480
oh we can't get access to the iphone of

169
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,040
the

170
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,040
assassin

171
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:05,839
they complained yeah

172
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,839
but

173
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,120
they wanted backdoor keys for all

174
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,920
iphones otherwise it couldn't do

175
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,920
investigations

176
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:33,839
and there was a huge um vulnerability

177
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,839
in the firewall

178
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:52,000
let's encrypt started

179
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,880
at the end of december yesterday so

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,880
it started

181
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:04,000
and here we see

182
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,000
after a short while

183
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:09,360
[Music]

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,360
with regard to encryption

185
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:17,760
this 50 of internet traffic is encrypted

186
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,920
with some imagination you can imagine

187
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,920
that

188
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,240
that those people who work at the

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,200
switches

190
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,800
who who were who were doing their

191
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,279
surveillance they were really unhappy

192
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,279
about this

193
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:45,360
there was only encrypted traffic

194
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:49,120
so they couldn't just just

195
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,000
steal the data 2016

196
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,839
not that much happened except that there

197
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,839
was another embarrassing thing for the

198
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,839
fbi

199
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:11,540
because they locked themselves out of

200
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:14,720
the iphone that they were investigating

201
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,719
[Music]

202
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,519
the first campaign that they tried was

203
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,519
really

204
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
ridiculous

205
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,000
at the end

206
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,179
[Music]

207
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,760
at the end of 2016 16

208
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:12,959
they tried to attack

209
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,959
encryption or europe

210
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,600
it was a concentrated campaign from the

211
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
beginning

212
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:30,959
the only objective of that campaign was

213
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:35,839
to push out

214
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,839
and to end encryption

215
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,120
encryption and obviously that's not

216
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,399
possible

217
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,720
because even they knew that

218
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,160
they couldn't just ask for enter end

219
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,839
encryption to be removed

220
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,120
maybe in the 90s but it's too late for

221
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:06,320
that now

222
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,560
yeah so the investigators were

223
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,959
rather unhappy that they couldn't access

224
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,959
the data

225
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,839
and netpolitik.org

226
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,040
remark from the translation i did not

227
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,760
yeah okay so

228
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,680
so they had less telephone um

229
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,279
surveillance

230
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:45,839
at this point because it was not

231
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:45,839
possible to obtain the data

232
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,720
because now all the traffic even in the

233
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,120
phone lines is

234
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:58,160
encrypted or basically the phones are

235
00:14:53,120 --> 00:15:01,680
not used

236
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:05,360
but of course you could still get a

237
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,519
phone the mobile location data you could

238
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:13,839
still obtain

239
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,839
but it wasn't like before

240
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,839
so this is really new half an hour ago

241
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,800
so there has to be some possibility to

242
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,880
get

243
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,359
at the contents of the end to end

244
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,360
encryption

245
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:06,639
so that there is like a secondary key

246
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,639
that decrypts

247
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:16,240
something that is also not uncommon

248
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,360
that it's coming that happens in some

249
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,279
companies where

250
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,839
there is a secondary encryption key a

251
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,839
decryption key

252
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,639
because it shouldn't be that for

253
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,040
companies that

254
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:36,160
only the employee can decrypt

255
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,160
and that's what they

256
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,839
this is a new outline

257
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:09,760
um have a successor for the

258
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:14,799
network um

259
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,799
so that the duty to report information

260
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,640
and the council said we're going to do a

261
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,720
resolution

262
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,760
so the eu commission basically said they

263
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,440
understood and

264
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:43,840
we're going to do it so they started

265
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,840
and indeed

266
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:50,880
started some random measures even before

267
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,880
the resolution was signed

268
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,360
in this resolution about high class

269
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:04,960
security

270
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:09,280
encryption and it seems like this was uh

271
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,280
yeah it wasn't it wasn't a fair feeling

272
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,960
the resolution that they were proposing

273
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,080
they're waiting for the bill they're not

274
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,919
gonna

275
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:27,360
publish it now because it was always

276
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:31,520
propelled forward by uh terror acts

277
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:34,479
and you can see the the growth

278
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,480
in what's up

279
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,719
over the time frame that this talk

280
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,320
covers from

281
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:46,240
august 14 to in the 90s

282
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,360
and the 19 and more and more traffic

283
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,600
emerged that

284
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,039
none of them could access and all of

285
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,000
these

286
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,000
surveillance measures

287
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,520
legislation about surveillance always

288
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,240
covered telephone networks

289
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,639
and it didn't cover all of these over

290
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,640
the

291
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,640
on top services that we now use

292
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:15,039
over the top that's what they call them

293
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,639
basically anything that is tcp ip is

294
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,240
already over the top for a telephone

295
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,000
network

296
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:26,880
so now we're in 2017 and

297
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:30,880
this is where the direction emerges

298
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:33,120
where the council only

299
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,720
passed the resolution now but they've

300
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,840
been preparing it back then already

301
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,840
and you can see it here

302
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:46,960
already in january there is a new

303
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:49,840
etsy standard for surveillance of uh

304
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,840
social networks

305
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,120
etsy they prepare the interface

306
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,600
for getting the data out of the social

307
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,600
networks

308
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,720
they need a certain format for the

309
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,799
surveillance

310
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,440
to be able to process the data so this

311
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,918
is what standardizes it

312
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,640
and they've already prepared everything

313
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:21,840
for

314
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:21,840
transporting the data

315
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:30,400
that they need for the surveillance but

316
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,400
it's nothing new really

317
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,559
this is the way it always worked for

318
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,918
surveillance

319
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,760
in in the eu frame

320
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,440
basically there's always there's a whole

321
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,480
host of small measures

322
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:49,840
that get that work together to have

323
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,840
more tools for surveillance

324
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:58,719
they always use the same um

325
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,799
cover-up reasoning like um terrorism or

326
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,880
uh breaking down of society in order to

327
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:07,360
justify this

328
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,360
and this is already in the council

329
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,840
it all happened at the same time a lot

330
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,840
of these measures

331
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,840
and at the end of 2007

332
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,080
it was the presidency of austria at that

333
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:31,600
time

334
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:32,879
the only thing i can say is

335
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,360
the only thing i can say is that

336
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:40,320
basically austria was competing for

337
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,320
the worst or last place with germany

338
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:46,960
they basically only passed surveillance

339
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,520
legislation it was the complete agenda

340
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:53,039
of the austrians was geared toward

341
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,879
passing more surveillance laws so

342
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,120
don't feel too bad about your german

343
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,559
politicians ours are even

344
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,600
worse probably so

345
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,520
the biggest priority was um surveillance

346
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,600
regarding facebook

347
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:12,639
our minister published the information

348
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,520
and yeah obviously that when the news

349
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,400
got out it was

350
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,400
all over the media

351
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:27,840
they basically already created the

352
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:27,840
interfaces the technical interfaces

353
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,480
the main one being that none of these

354
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,760
internet companies that we're interested

355
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,440
in

356
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:41,600
never really sit in our countries

357
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,000
so when you want

358
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,879
information from them basically they

359
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,799
have to ask

360
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:51,039
the law enforcement in ireland

361
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,158
to pass it on to them and to force them

362
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:56,240
to comply

363
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,159
so over the years this became more and

364
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,400
more complex

365
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:06,400
and all of these surveillance standards

366
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,200
they became less and less usable and

367
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,240
they became

368
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,240
more and more complex

369
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,240
and there were more and more

370
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,720
requirements

371
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,720
for that

372
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,879
in 2018

373
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,239
what started in 2017 finally came to

374
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,919
pass

375
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,039
on all layers of the eu

376
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,760
it started at the same time

377
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,760
austria said that surveillance of

378
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,799
facebook needs to have priority over

379
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,158
everything else

380
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,158
it was an e-government

381
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:56,960
the ordinance was really insistent

382
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:01,200
on having uh an agreement with the us

383
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:04,240
regarding cloud surveillance

384
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,559
in essence you can you can

385
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,559
have surveillance on my cloud services

386
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:12,960
if you grant me

387
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,960
um surveillance on your end

388
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:25,039
more or less all of the

389
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:25,039
cloud services are all us companies so

390
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,200
the u.s basically passed on the

391
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,039
agreement

392
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,679
and said which is going to have our own

393
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,919
legislation since all of the

394
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,760
internet provided so the the service

395
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:47,840
providers are all our companies we can

396
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:47,840
just unilaterally get it

397
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,080
it was basically out of the question

398
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,600
that it would pass in 2008

399
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,399
and yet didn't they didn't

400
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,879
have the time to prepare it and now they

401
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,279
have

402
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:15,360
um surveillance that transcends borders

403
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:17,600
in a bill

404
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,279
basically if you if you get an order to

405
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,760
do it then you have

406
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:26,960
six hours to comply with that so if the

407
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:30,240
the austrian government says look

408
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,679
we need the data and talks to you as the

409
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,159
german government then you have to

410
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,480
comply

411
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,480
and pass it on within a few hours

412
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,120
so any major law that you break

413
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,120
should

414
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,159
and then there was a lawsuit regarding

415
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,879
um

416
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:16,000
access to encrypting messengers with

417
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,919
regards to facebook

418
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,840
and facebook it was

419
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,840
about the implementation of the sd5

420
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
protocol

421
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,600
do you look at the key the encryption

422
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,039
negotiation that happens in the

423
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,439
beginning where you try to settle on a

424
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,440
protocol

425
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,480
they send it across the facebook server

426
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:44,080
and that's an invitation to just

427
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,080
catch the key when it passes there

428
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,080
okay so what what does this have to do

429
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,400
with encryption a lot

430
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,399
actually

431
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:07,840
in 2015 there was

432
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,840
there was a gh2 um

433
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:17,679
they could have a third key for the

434
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,678
providers so that

435
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,720
if they could do the decryption for

436
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,720
the secret services

437
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,000
and on the same day

438
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,840
and when that was revealed

439
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,360
because otherwise the system will

440
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:51,200
collapse

441
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,199
and the police said the same thing

442
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,840
all of the law enforcement basically

443
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,840
said that

444
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,840
and the ec

445
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
said

446
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,320
suggest a new security standard for

447
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,919
encryption

448
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:17,840
[Music]

449
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,840
and it is

450
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:31,840
that can be

451
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:44,480
so they suggested a successor that

452
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:46,960
is broken basically

453
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,919
and then there was this protest because

454
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,360
it was

455
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,880
not a secure transfer layer so the name

456
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:59,279
was misleading

457
00:28:52,880 --> 00:29:01,760
of the successors

458
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,120
the united states wanted to have a data

459
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,480
exchange with itself

460
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,719
and then of course the tarot debate came

461
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,720
back

462
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,279
actually that were the attacks in

463
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,320
christchurch

464
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:21,039
new zealand that triggered these

465
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:24,960
um calls for

466
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,960
breaking encryption and of course the

467
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,440
government trojans are getting more

468
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,440
expensive

469
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:37,340
and yes

470
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,419
on the first of december 2019

471
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,419
[Music]

472
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,320
one moment it's the epic briefing of the

473
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,320
ministers

474
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:11,440
referring to an agreement made in 2016

475
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,480
that they made across different

476
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,240
institutions

477
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:19,039
institutions so

478
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,039
aunt

479
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:27,840
um and on this day

480
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,840
there was a briefing

481
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:40,320
of the club of burn for the ministers

482
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:44,399
that is the club of 26 or 27

483
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,399
countries with their secret services

484
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,840
who were discussing important matters on

485
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,840
an informal basis

486
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:57,099
[Music]

487
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,399
yeah right what did they discuss or what

488
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,399
did they say to each other

489
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:09,679
but in february of this year

490
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,679
there was the plague

491
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:19,840
there was a new law in the u.s

492
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
senate

493
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:33,840
and that contained

494
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:51,360
are not able to identify all of their

495
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,240
all of the content they are hosting then

496
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,240
they lose

497
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,158
lose the right to just say they are

498
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,159
innocent

499
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:05,919
or not involved and that's why

500
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:15,200
it was argued that end-to-end encryption

501
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:17,679
should not be supported

502
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,679
and then there was also someone from the

503
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,559
eu that said we need to do something

504
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,720
against

505
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,519
the eu and we don't want backdoors we

506
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,519
want front doors

507
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,720
the fbi shifts that was something that

508
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,480
was already

509
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:37,600
demanded in 2015 golden keys

510
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:43,840
but it's just like new language it's

511
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:43,840
it's nonsense

512
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,120
you guys said in the council

513
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:11,840
um in air quotes

514
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,399
so this is what the law says that

515
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,760
we need to investigate if

516
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,799
a child pornography can be identified in

517
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,110
the

518
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:31,230
data stream

519
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:31,229
[Music]

520
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,240
and then they did a study

521
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:53,840
it wasn't really clear

522
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,879
you should be able to identify them

523
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,000
according to the hashes used in the

524
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,159
encryption

525
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:09,120
and then the german council presidency

526
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,120
had the idea

527
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:18,000
where there are seven methods that they

528
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,119
put down

529
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,679
in a document

530
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,599
where they wanted to have seven

531
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,280
properties

532
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,800
or seven methods that where you can

533
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,280
identify encrypted

534
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,520
traffic but it turns out that none of

535
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,480
them actually worked

536
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,719
what they did was they took the method

537
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,320
by the gchq

538
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,319
and used it completely differently

539
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,759
basically a second key using it during

540
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,919
the encryption process

541
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,919
and

542
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,440
they added a lot of nonsense about

543
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:03,839
child pornography and how to identify it

544
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,839
and it was highly misleading

545
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,680
they wanted to prove that this was the

546
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,680
only way to do it

547
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,200
yes so

548
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,839
is

549
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,680
about accessing encrypted data for

550
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,720
signal and whatsapp

551
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,598
and that's the same that k-hop is trying

552
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,598
to do in europe

553
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,520
basically there was a choreography just

554
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,160
like

555
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,160
in ballet

556
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:51,839
in july there was a new regulation

557
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,279
against secure

558
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:59,839
encryption but nothing concrete has been

559
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,839
announced yet

560
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,200
basically there's a lot of petty fogging

561
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,720
the issue

562
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,480
saying that the the problems will

563
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,319
increase so much that we're not going to

564
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:12,880
be able to handle it

565
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,880
and in

566
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,839
is not the name i would use anymore it's

567
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,839
just too weak for that now

568
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,520
no it's not bad

569
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,240
the field was

570
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,359
this is a clear case of misinformation

571
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,800
by

572
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,799
an eu commission member

573
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,800
so i have a little bit of time left let

574
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:23,759
me explain this

575
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:26,560
in july she unknown

576
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,880
several platforms need to be searched

577
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,920
for

578
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,640
internet for child pornography on a

579
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,839
regular

580
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:38,879
basis including encrypted communication

581
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:42,400
because the um the availability and the

582
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:47,680
transmission of this kind of

583
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,680
video has exploded over the recent time

584
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,160
this is the result yeah there has been

585
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,160
an increase

586
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:04,799
it's not an explosion in the traffic

587
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:07,200
but rather microsoft

588
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,079
rolled out a software called portal dna

589
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,359
already in 2009

590
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:19,839
it's basically a photo

591
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:19,839
db with all sorts of

592
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:32,720
they marked every video and photo that

593
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:35,680
they could find and gave it a hashtag

594
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,879
they basically base their filters on

595
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,240
that and they're already

596
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,240
the filters are already running

597
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,079
it only started marking up videos in

598
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:47,200
2016 16 because

599
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,839
because that's when they gained the

600
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,879
capability

601
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:55,279
and that means

602
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,240
the explosion of the pedo criminal

603
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,079
content

604
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,759
is more or less can be traced back to a

605
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,480
software update

606
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,359
it was just not possible to find them

607
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,040
before

608
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:11,520
they were able to mark the videos

609
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:15,839
and since more and more platforms are

610
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,839
integrating the tool by microsoft

611
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
and more and more videos were being

612
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,640
highlighted as

613
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,920
containing problematic content that

614
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,839
doesn't mean that the

615
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,760
the amount of video content increased

616
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,759
it's just that we can find more now

617
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,839
so

618
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:53,099
[Music]

619
00:39:53,760 --> 00:40:00,240
an overview over this

620
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,240
weekend

621
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,160
so this was all wrong it was all

622
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,160
misinformation

623
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,960
then we

624
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,000
though you only solve a minuscule part

625
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,000
of the

626
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
issue so

627
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,799
they're claiming that if we can't filter

628
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,560
against terrorists on your platform then

629
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,359
you're not being allowed to provide that

630
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,359
service anymore

631
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,680
so none of this had anything to do with

632
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,839
if you look at the latest terror attack

633
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:56,400
basically the guy had no contact

634
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,319
to any um inciting sources on the

635
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,560
internet nothing on the phone

636
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:05,520
completely clean but it was enough

637
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,520
so there was another

638
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,520
within five days they got it through the

639
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,480
council because they basically said now

640
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,440
and never

641
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,440
we have to do it now

642
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:22,560
basically always the same process since

643
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,319
2014

644
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,119
whenever there's a terror attack push

645
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:35,839
another piece of legislation

646
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:35,839
so beginning of november

647
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,639
[Music]

648
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:49,520
the international statement that

649
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,599
was published earlier

650
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,440
so the international statement is

651
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,319
nothing

652
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:59,040
but a declaration by the five eyes

653
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,040
ministers

654
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,119
to have a very close contact and

655
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:15,359
have a continuous dialogue with them

656
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:20,240
especially with the uk

657
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:20,240
regarding this matter because

658
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:29,040
the third key scheme

659
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,040
originated within the gchq and

660
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:36,160
was published in 2017 for the first time

661
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:39,119
and that's when i when i met the guy in

662
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,000
in in the university of cambridge during

663
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,760
a talk

664
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,079
where he was already trying to publish

665
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,599
this

666
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,599
and where he was saying that

667
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:53,520
the law enforcement branch needs extra

668
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,240
keys for their

669
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,960
for their work and this is what it's all

670
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,479
about

671
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:04,240
propaganda lies more lies

672
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,880
behind the scenes agreement and a lot of

673
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,359
theater where they brought it all

674
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,359
together

675
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:16,560
this is more or less

676
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,598
all i wanted to say about this in

677
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,680
breakneck pace but you can read it all

678
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:27,839
if you go to my website

679
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,839
have a look at it

680
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:33,200
and there's a lot of images on it

681
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,560
and this is where i'm going to end my

682
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,799
talk

683
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,799
and

david

685
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,520
i'm really curious if there's any

686
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,520
questions about this

687
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,240
video

688
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,720
if people are interested we can have a

689
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:02,479
long q a in a different room if you want

690
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:04,640
and thank you

691
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,160
uh ladies and gentlemen thank you for

692
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,960
your attention and

693
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,960
now let's open for

694
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,560
thank you very much for this

695
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,560
comprehensive explanation

696
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,839
and there's so much information

697
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:31,280
um that's some really heavy stuff

698
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,280
we have some questions

699
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,560
if you want to ask questions you can

700
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:41,520
send them on irc

701
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:45,359
or with twitter rc

702
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:49,280
three and then one

703
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:54,000
o n e r c three one as the hashtags

704
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:56,480
to ask questions from irc

705
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,480
question

706
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:02,078
[Music]

707
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,000
what about changing of governments as a

708
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:07,599
german i don't

709
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,599
know changes of government

710
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,240
um yes so this actually changed

711
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:19,839
um yes as the parties just do what they

712
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,839
want

713
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:33,520
so this time i have to say

714
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:36,560
that they have a different approach

715
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,040
it wasn't like the big outcry that we

716
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:42,160
need to

717
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:42,160
do more um surveillance no

718
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,920
because the thing is that um

719
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:52,160
that they had the um terrorists on the

720
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,599
radar they

721
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,598
were surveilling them

722
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,680
they did not

723
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,800
and that was basically the reason why it

724
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,000
had these headlines that

725
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:11,280
they just could not decrypt

726
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,920
the uh information but they were aware

727
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,920
of the people

728
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,560
so the next question from the rsc

729
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,000
what where do you see the surveillance

730
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,480
or what what's the surveillance going to

731
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,880
be like within the next five years

732
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:44,319
okay well that's hard to say

733
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,720
i can't honestly not answer that

734
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,720
question

735
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:54,560
so i'm doing this for 25 years and i'm

736
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,520
reporting on it but if you know a lot of

737
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,240
history

738
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,240
then you can

739
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:05,520
predict or extrapolate history into the

740
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,520
future but not that much

741
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,319
so more than 10 years i don't dare to

742
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,319
make predictions

743
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,160
so what will happen in the next five

744
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,640
years on the eu level

745
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,640
he said

746
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,118
that they

747
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,219
[Music]

748
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:41,040
from the security researchers

749
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,480
and it will be a long fight

750
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:47,119
because the politicians and the

751
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,359
um secret services really really want

752
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,359
this

753
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:56,799
and the secret services are really

754
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,160
um desperate because in earlier years

755
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,280
they just

756
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:04,879
directly tapped on the internet

757
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:08,400
uh lines but it's no longer possible and

758
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:13,520
they they they are really

759
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,520
nostalgic um about the good old times

760
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:20,078
and that's and that's no longer the case

761
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:24,240
and let's say that's why they want to

762
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:27,599
re-establish their powers

763
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,598
or their capabilities

764
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,759
but i'm already old enough

765
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:38,880
to just look at this with a bit of

766
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,880
sport spirit

767
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,640
and we will basically catch them

768
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,119
whenever they try to

769
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,279
um whenever they have the next demand

770
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:54,160
coming up we will have an eye on

771
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:54,160
the surveillance people

772
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,400
and we caused a lot of bad press before

773
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,800
the

774
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,640
whole thing took off because we're

775
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,640
keeping an eye on the new legislation

776
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:14,799
thanks a lot from the irc community

777
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:18,558
great talk even i have more questions

778
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:20,319
so i'm wondering why is it why is this

779
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,920
or how could we make this more or less

780
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:25,040
effective

781
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:27,839
so the way i see it is

782
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:30,079
there is end-to-end encryption how can

783
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:33,279
you actually abolish that because

784
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:35,040
can't you just can't you just put in an

785
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,480
extra layer of encryption on top or

786
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,200
below

787
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,520
which could hardly be broken that is

788
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,520
true

789
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:51,280
i actually think that they are fighting

790
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:53,119
and withdrawing but

791
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,559
it's not like they can do whatever they

792
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:59,839
want

793
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:59,839
they have

794
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:13,839
against them

795
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,800
so it's because um they no longer dare

796
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,839
as

797
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,680
to propose such something like this as a

798
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:31,200
single country they

799
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:34,879
they basically try to push

800
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,879
their demands as

801
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,759
as a collection of countries and we are

802
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,200
ourselves in a good position because

803
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:45,040
there's always some way we can

804
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,040
protect ourselves or defend ourselves

805
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:56,480
or if they actually try to attack signal

806
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,480
we don't know if they will do this

807
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:10,399
there's people that just want to

808
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,040
communicate normally being social or

809
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:23,839
maybe just

810
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:23,839
do business

811
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:37,839
and the united states is also trying to

812
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,839
attack the big corporations

813
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,800
um really busy then

814
00:51:53,280 --> 00:52:00,240
yeah new

815
00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:04,319
basically new demands come up slowly

816
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:07,359
yeah another question from irc

817
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:11,359
are there specific

818
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:11,359
instructions what we can do to stop this

819
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:17,839
public make it public

820
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,839
you need to involve the people on all

821
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:22,880
levels

822
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:24,960
um trade associations they're all

823
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,400
affected

824
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:33,839
and they really don't like it is

825
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,839
american services

826
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,720
exactly not just the chinese that are

827
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:45,359
grabbing for

828
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,359
trade secrets

829
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:54,480
only the nsa claims to be so holy

830
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,480
as to not do that but

831
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:01,839
i believe the economy isn't trusting

832
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,839
them at all

833
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,160
those are all points that we have to do

834
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:15,279
one thing that i took away from the

835
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:19,359
crypto wars

836
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,359
where anderson was really important

837
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:26,960
so basically the crypto was 1-0

838
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,520
from 94 to 2000 and something when we

839
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,960
won

840
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,880
we were the group that really was

841
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:34,000
protesting and

842
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:37,440
we had a huge silent

843
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,440
um comrade

844
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,839
do you know who supports us

845
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,720
where we get our money from for the

846
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:52,319
conference basically the banksters

847
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:56,558
the the banks were supporting us

848
00:53:52,319 --> 00:54:00,240
because we were really surprised

849
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,240
we we really couldn't believe it

850
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,680
they were trying to get digital banking

851
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,880
going

852
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:11,839
and what they needed was secure

853
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,839
encryption

854
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,680
and that's why they said

855
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,480
it was it's great that there are so many

856
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,480
banking groups

857
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:26,799
because that saves us a lot of effort

858
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:31,119
and

859
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:33,599
time and we we don't need our own astro

860
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,599
turfing

861
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:37,920
do you know what that is

862
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,319
not so public organization that has

863
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,880
clinton motors or at least their very

864
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,880
own agenda

865
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,760
if you by any chance

866
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,279
we're probably not going to be perpetual

867
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,599
friends with google apple or

868
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,599
facebook or whatever but if we if we can

869
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:31,440
work along on certain issues that's

870
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,440
actually really helpful yes

871
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,520
what do you think of the googles the

872
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,520
amazons the apples

873
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:45,759
if you believe apple

874
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:48,000
they their reputations on the line

875
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,000
is

876
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:03,119
so how can we prevent them from

877
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,919
smuggling in back doors into our open

878
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,280
source

879
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:11,280
software yeah i'm

880
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,799
i'm a uh i'm i'm a linguist not a

881
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,240
computer scientist

882
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:19,200
and i'm not qualified to enter here

883
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:22,000
but i'm asking you to solve that problem

884
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:25,520
yourself you're the hackers not me

885
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:31,839
i'm i'm just um yeah an apprentice

886
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:31,839
at best what what's regarding the

887
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:41,680
i've been educated by the community and

888
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,920
i'm really grateful for that

889
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,078
but i'm really sorry i can't answer that

890
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,079
one

891
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:59,839
certainly possible

892
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,558
they poison some software but this is

893
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,680
it's not possible to do that on a large

894
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,839
scale

895
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:13,200
or to an extent where you cover most of

896
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:17,119
the software

897
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:19,200
so i'm pretty so sure that

898
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:20,240
members of the ccp would notice pretty

899
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,680
quickly

900
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,759
and i don't think this is a very

901
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:28,319
persistent threat

902
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:41,839
all right then i think this is the end

903
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:41,839
again thank you very much

904
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:55,839
wow

905
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,960
you
