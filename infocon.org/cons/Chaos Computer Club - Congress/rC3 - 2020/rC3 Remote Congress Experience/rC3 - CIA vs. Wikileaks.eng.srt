as we said the years before

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:22,720
the force merged to maine andy

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,119
is commonly known in rsc his current

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,799
talk

8
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:29,519
caa versus wikileaks intimidation

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,640
civilians and other tactics observed and

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,680
experienced

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,800
in his talk andy aims and

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,040
to report and shows a collection of his

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,760
observations physical

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,079
visual and other evidences of the last

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,600
year

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,879
incidents that strongly indicate the

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,840
context of the u.s central agency

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,800
central intelligence agency agency and

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,520
potentially

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,280
other entities of the earth government

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,840
acting against wikileaks

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,879
and surrounding persons and

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,600
organizations please welcome

24
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,920
with the very warm digital appliance

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,920
andy

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,759
okay i i have no idea how a digital

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,119
laplace works here but um

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,640
thanks for thanks for it anyhow um

29
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,880
at the beginning i want to make and i

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,600
have to make a few disclaimers so that

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,640
you know

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,119
um which perspective you're getting here

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,759
um i'm working as a data journalist for

34
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,000
quite a while

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,080
around the topics of survival and signal

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
intelligence data security i'm running

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,560
this funny bug planet

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,079
even started that blockplanet.info

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,640
before snowden came with all his

40
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,679
documents but i did work a while

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,439
with his documents um however this talk

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,720
is a bit different as i'm not talking

43
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,880
about things that i you know

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,560
learned studied or whatever but i

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,479
experienced myself

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,840
i'm describing events here where i was

47
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,799
targeted

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,399
and so i might not be the most neutral

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,200
person

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,960
in this scenario but i'm trying to be

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,000
technically as accurate as possible

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,439
anyhow so forgive me if i'm a bit grumpy

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,080
about these people um that's just

54
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,680
because of the perspective

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,760
secondly while i've also and the ccc of

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,599
course has been addressing human rights

57
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,640
issues in the digital age for a long

58
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,200
time

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,160
we and i personally co-founded eg the

60
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,839
european digital rights initiative and

61
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,160
to ensure the enforcement of human

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,440
rights in the digital environment

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,239
however what happened here is a slightly

64
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,040
beyond digital rights it goes into real

65
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,040
life

66
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,799
and while i'm a german citizen and i

67
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,400
know roughly what kind of laws have been

68
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,120
violated here

69
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,760
in respect to the german environment i

70
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,840
absolutely would welcome people who

71
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,840
helped me analyze and understand it from

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,440
the perspective of the universal human

73
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,560
rights

74
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,760
because there is similar cases with

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,959
people living on

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,200
other jurisdictions and so on um

77
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,720
second slide of disclaimers sorry that

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,079
it's so much

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,359
um so i'm addressing with this talk

80
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,519
activities against people surrounding

81
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,040
and have been and or surrounding julian

82
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,599
and or wikileaks

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,560
and or other members of wikileaks um

84
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,040
whatever i describe here is

85
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,400
have i have personally observed and

86
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,519
experienced it

87
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,680
so it is for sure very incomplete

88
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,280
it's at best a fragment of what's going

89
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,400
on but um

90
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,599
you will in case you haven't heard about

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,920
it yet that pompeo

92
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,000
yeah made some very clear statements

93
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,280
when he was head of cia

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,990
it's pretty clear where to attribute

95
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,599
these things

96
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:46,480
[Music]

97
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,399
and lastly there is of course other

98
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,720
prisons as mentioned but i'm keeping

99
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,360
them

100
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,760
out here for all kinds of reasons um but

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,519
there will be the time when

102
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,040
we will hear more reports and other

103
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,560
perspective of this

104
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:04,400
particular situation so

105
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,560
um here's my little overview i want to

106
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,680
get you an idea how to get into such a

107
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,959
mess

108
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,599
um just in case you know you want it

109
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,599
um the context on the timeline a bit of

110
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,599
psychology as it's important because at

111
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,639
some point you not only get paranoid you

112
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,959
have this drive

113
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,280
to oh no this can't be true right you

114
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,040
have this cognitive dissonance

115
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,479
uh drive inside of you that you would

116
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,320
like to stay

117
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,080
um saying um the new normal of i.t

118
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,759
incidents we're all used to that covered

119
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,758
versus overt

120
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,759
what's what i mean with the term

121
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,520
intimidations of violence physical

122
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,360
events and their impact

123
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,960
about the elephant in the room the

124
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,639
problem with the missing socks

125
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,440
um and at the end a little bit of

126
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,080
questions

127
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,080
in my infectious um how to get out of

128
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,359
this mess maybe also

129
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,719
so um how to get into such a beautiful

130
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,600
mess

131
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,000
wait it's not beautiful um well there's

132
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,000
some

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,320
ideas we share in the hacker community

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,680
usually and even

135
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,680
it's not far from where to get into the

136
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,080
journalist community

137
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,039
information should be free free flow of

138
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,440
information

139
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,560
um is a bit of a requirement for world

140
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,160
peace

141
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,759
and we had this um and i personally also

142
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,919
had this type of

143
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,120
self-conception self-understanding

144
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,919
consciousness

145
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,080
20 years already when weekly started

146
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,440
around 2006 so

147
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,479
this is not that i was jumping or

148
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,320
anybody in the scene was jumping um

149
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,800
onto something that didn't exist until

150
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,400
then but um wikileaks turned out to be

151
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,800
an extremely

152
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,880
good um concept as a democracy test

153
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,720
if governments cannot deal with full

154
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,560
transparency well that tells you a lot

155
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,880
about them

156
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,880
and but of course that is similar to

157
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,080
um jumping into the last point similar

158
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,440
to

159
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,359
um working in journalism when you

160
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,719
expose things in joliets and be it

161
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,160
corruption

162
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,160
be it hypocrisy of politicians be it

163
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,000
blunt lies or whatever it's not always

164
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,120
about making friends

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,560
um it's um yes partly making friends and

166
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,639
partly

167
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,280
pissing people off that's um happens

168
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,080
however in this particular environments

169
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,000
that

170
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:33,039
julian inspired to um create

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,960
um there's some yeah cultural even

172
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,318
misunderstandings for example the word

173
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,359
conspiracy

174
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,840
for us in europe i think many of us in

175
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,600
the

176
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,679
german hacker scene are inspired by

177
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,360
robert and wilson's way of saying oh a

178
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,840
conspiracy is like

179
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,000
the world is full of them and we should

180
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,440
join the best of them

181
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,759
but the in the american context

182
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,280
the word conspiracy is a legal term

183
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,759
unfortunately

184
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,599
and when you are with american citizens

185
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,360
in a room and talk about conspiracies

186
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,719
they often get very nervous and it's

187
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,840
kind of a complete different

188
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,840
attitude because it's like the u.s term

189
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,719
to define people who belong to a group

190
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,799
like

191
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,160
organized criminals or organized you

192
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,800
know this t-word this

193
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,280
other type of entities and of course

194
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,440
that's

195
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,400
absolutely not what we want to get into

196
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,160
involved to

197
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,799
but sometimes we mistakenly or

198
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,240
misunderstandingly joke about

199
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,639
conspiracies

200
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,360
and people listening to this get it

201
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,720
completely wrong and i feel that is also

202
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,440
what happened

203
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,199
um and how uh yeah me and others got

204
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,360
into such a mess

205
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:44,479
um so at the end of course um journalism

206
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,039
and that's similar to um

207
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,758
yeah dealing with data from a hacker's

208
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,960
perspective

209
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,120
is about yeah supporting

210
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,400
media with data and information and so

211
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,080
on

212
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,799
um so here's a bit of a timeline to give

213
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,318
you

214
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,960
a time frame i'm now after i was

215
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,800
a bit long for about two decades in ccc

216
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,599
spokesperson and board member blah blah

217
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,599
blah

218
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,960
i moved to the board of the valhalla

219
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,000
foundation where online foundation

220
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,120
collects actually

221
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,240
money for wikileaks under the aspect of

222
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,599
wow's idea of supporting freedom of

223
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,440
information

224
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:26,319
since 2010 or so i joined a little later

225
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,520
however when wikileaks started to

226
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,440
publish the

227
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,280
afghanistan the iraq warlocks the

228
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,080
diplomatic cables

229
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,240
um that already triggered legal

230
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,880
investigations and of course the arrest

231
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,320
of

232
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,200
dan still bradley now josiah manning um

233
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,680
later so there was always it was always

234
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,279
clear

235
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,959
more or less right from the beginning

236
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,279
that there's legal trouble on the way

237
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,880
that there's a secret grand jury

238
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,959
and that the americans didn't really

239
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,000
appreciate their war crimes to be

240
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,479
exposed

241
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,600
and their diplomatic cables to be in the

242
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,320
internet

243
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,640
to be understood and readable for all of

244
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,680
us

245
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,120
and the media worldwide and so on um

246
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,719
of course um when people come together

247
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,440
and gather in any

248
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,320
project you have human beings you have

249
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,279
they have characters they have mistakes

250
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,320
um they do things that are not always

251
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,160
great

252
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,399
so i'm not trying to say here that

253
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,240
everything was always great and it was

254
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,279
only the cia messing it up now

255
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,880
humans make mistakes and these mistakes

256
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,360
in such an environment of course get

257
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,600
exploited get amplified

258
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:40,320
and so on in 2007

259
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,279
um wikileaks started publishing some cra

260
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,440
documents

261
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,040
and a whole series of it the so-called

262
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,839
fault seven

263
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,240
documents and those documents describe

264
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,160
yeah

265
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,200
technology exploit programs from the cra

266
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,640
you probably most of you will know them

267
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,519
if not you can now look them up um these

268
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,240
included tools that allowed the caa to

269
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,000
pretend to be someone else including

270
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,240
coming from another country speaking

271
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,480
another language be from russia

272
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,519
in russian be it from iran and farsi and

273
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,720
so on

274
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,040
and um pompeo who was at that

275
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,560
moment still ahead of this year a got

276
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,480
very upset

277
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,399
there's two references from this one is

278
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,079
from april 217

279
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:29,519
and another is from february to 18.

280
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,760
in his first public speech as a cra

281
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,440
director

282
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:38,000
uh 13th of april 217 um

283
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,200
he made a speech at a conference waskin

284
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,160
in washington

285
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,160
and he said things like wikileaks walks

286
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,760
like a hostile intelligence service and

287
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,560
talks like an intelligent service

288
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,399
and called wikileaks a non-state hostile

289
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,479
intelligence service

290
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,720
so for those of you who know a little

291
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,480
bit about information science

292
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,399
this this idea of data is actually

293
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,320
something you can technically measure

294
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,920
information is data in a context and

295
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,920
intelligence is

296
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,680
information processed to a level where

297
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,240
you can make decisions based on

298
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,120
it so being a public intelligence

299
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,760
service

300
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,240
i would say from that perspective is

301
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,360
like a

302
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,920
honorable term however um

303
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,640
yeah the way pompeo emphasized it i

304
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,880
think

305
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,800
uh was slightly not that honorable he

306
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,000
was more comparing it to you know

307
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,519
other state actors and evil forces and

308
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,839
so on because

309
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,480
the u.s understanding of intelligence

310
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,399
services far away

311
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,399
from entities or any other water

312
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,279
um is far away from entities just

313
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,359
collecting information

314
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,760
but as you know they also mess up with

315
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,760
other people's life and so on

316
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:57,920
um however a year later

317
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,040
in uh february to 18 he even upgraded

318
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,560
this type of

319
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,560
statements at that site german newspaper

320
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,479
reported about what he said at the

321
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,359
munich security conference

322
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,519
intelligence roundtable and he said

323
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,680
really nasty sentence like that

324
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,360
he's most of his time he's dealing with

325
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,160
the non-state actors

326
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,480
and that's like al-qaeda islamic state

327
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,920
uh

328
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,120
wikileaks or hezbollah like what a list

329
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:29,680
so i have no idea um

330
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,680
what he has um yeah what turned him into

331
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,160
um comparing these kind of things i mean

332
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,040
his butler i could say we in berlin

333
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,079
um we know that they provide actually

334
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,360
jami halloumi

335
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,839
and and um some things but yes they are

336
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,079
money launderers and are suspected

337
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,639
terrorists in some areas or whatever

338
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,560
i have been declared terrorist but the

339
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,399
hummus is really good i can say

340
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,479
um however the um

341
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,079
point i'm trying to come to so pompeo

342
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,240
got very upset

343
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,439
he made all this comparison and he seems

344
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,959
to have

345
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,480
um yeah allocated resources to deal with

346
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,920
wikileaks and everybody

347
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,399
jumping around and it's no surprise that

348
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,680
esvalholland foundation

349
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:20,000
finances selected activities of

350
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:23,199
specific publications there um

351
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,320
that we also got in the focus with us

352
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,399
uh collecting donations and um you know

353
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,519
talking with the guys and financing some

354
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,800
projects

355
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,279
so um before i'm coming to very concrete

356
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,319
events

357
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,680
i want to you get one second into

358
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,199
psychology

359
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,839
so of course when things happen to you

360
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,519
um from the intelligence perspective

361
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,519
they always come with what's called

362
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,040
plausible deniability

363
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,120
when there's a guy standing in front of

364
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,800
the door watching you know if you come

365
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,240
in and out it's not just someone

366
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,719
watching your door or someone reading

367
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,279
the newspaper or

368
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,399
repairing some electrical pipes or some

369
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,560
water pipe or whatever

370
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,560
i mean there's always a good reason for

371
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,479
him to be there that has nothing to do

372
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,279
with what he's doing

373
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,360
and um that that's basic principle

374
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,839
plausible deniability

375
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,000
how intelligence agencies act in the

376
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,920
so-called field so meaning in your home

377
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,600
or on the street they're following you

378
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,439
or whatever

379
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,720
so um over time um of course if you have

380
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,560
too much of this

381
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,040
you're seeing these patterns and that's

382
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,000
probably mainly called paranoia so you

383
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,920
get like

384
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,160
you know suspicious of everything that

385
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,920
happens that might be very legitimate

386
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,839
but you get like the feeling that

387
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,560
something is wrong and so on

388
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,480
um and that can be um we could also

389
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,638
instead of paranoia call it

390
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,240
situational awareness at some points

391
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,920
because if it really happens it has

392
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,880
nothing to do with your mind getting

393
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,000
crazy

394
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,040
it's just an accurate observation of

395
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,920
patterns that happens around of you

396
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,959
but you might know that and your two

397
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,120
friends who

398
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,359
experience the same might know that your

399
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,120
girlfriend your partner

400
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,040
the normal people you deal with they

401
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,360
might all not understand this

402
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,199
and think that you're driving nuts and

403
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,800
this driving nuts is of course

404
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,839
an element um that you always have to be

405
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,399
self-critical

406
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,040
because on the one hand side you might

407
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,199
indeed

408
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,120
see too much things happening that do

409
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,359
not really happen on the other hand side

410
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,399
there's also this human drive that

411
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,360
we don't want this cra guys to be in our

412
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,839
life

413
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,399
we want everything is to be fine and to

414
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,639
some

415
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,839
extent maybe that's even healthy to not

416
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,160
see the monsters

417
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,199
all the time but if they are really

418
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,040
there

419
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,240
and you start denying them while they

420
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,199
sit in front of you

421
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,800
um that's also not so helpful so i found

422
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,920
myself in this kind of

423
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,839
um yeah weird environment where all

424
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,800
these kind of thoughts come up all the

425
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,360
time

426
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,160
and i'm starting with the most harmless

427
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,600
stuff

428
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,040
so internet attacks hubble or internet

429
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,160
incidents i would

430
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,880
i t incidents i called it here um due to

431
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,279
the

432
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,000
pure volume of it i will put this into

433
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,120
separate

434
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,399
um presentation one day or report

435
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,240
and in the next days or weeks or months

436
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,279
and and you can all have fun with it but

437
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,720
she has just some basic patterns so

438
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,000
devices um you use as communication

439
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,880
terminals or

440
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,800
communication devices they always have

441
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,480
issues when you start to do encrypted

442
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,758
stuff and it's always when you do it

443
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,199
with specific people

444
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,600
so that's then

445
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,959
mobile phones with data service at some

446
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,440
point all of them

447
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:44,800
have start to have issues very high

448
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,800
volume of used data

449
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:51,680
apps disappear if you use them at all

450
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:55,040
i stopped using them at all um

451
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,959
now high battery use it when you did

452
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,880
nothing with your film over hours and

453
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,199
you were wondering what's going on

454
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,639
okay yes we have faraday bags we put

455
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,799
them somewhere else but still

456
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,439
it's a little weird when your battery is

457
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:11,119
empty half day

458
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:13,280
on lte i'm when i configured my phone to

459
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,719
be on lte only it worked mainly fine

460
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,918
next to that i couldn't make normal

461
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,400
phone calls

462
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,400
but when i had it in the normal mode it

463
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,039
got downgraded to 3g

464
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,720
and there my encrypted connections

465
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,919
started to have problems

466
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,760
on my fixed lines my vpns when i tried

467
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,340
to build up a vpn shows me

468
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,440
certificate errors and problems

469
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,280
[Music]

470
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,960
and then of course you deal with

471
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,639
journalists which i'm doing with my

472
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,919
colleagues all the time

473
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,840
and they are not technical experts they

474
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,799
all have their macs and so on so they

475
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,799
have funny issues with their pgp keys

476
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,720
not working anymore with their pgp

477
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,639
setups not working anymore

478
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,880
yes it's also because it's open source

479
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,760
software but um there's also something

480
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,600
going on

481
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,360
but this is kind of the world we all

482
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,159
know and we get used to it you know this

483
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,520
is like okay

484
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,760
i.t doesn't work secure um

485
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,960
connections break well happens all the

486
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,760
time

487
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:15,200
um from about mid

488
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:17,520
217 when i um still regularly

489
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,919
like once twice a month was flying over

490
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,918
to see julian in the embassy

491
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,840
i realized that there was something

492
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,840
changing it with my treatment at the

493
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,480
border that's of course not ca that's

494
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,918
purely

495
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,559
uk border police uncles and they like

496
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,480
asked who started to ask funny questions

497
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,639
like do you live in the uk

498
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,880
what's your occupation how long do you

499
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,799
stay what do you do in the uk

500
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,039
before then there was maybe one question

501
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,840
but not three four of them

502
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,600
and the most important was that i

503
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,159
realized that he did not even

504
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,918
listen to my answers sometimes he

505
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,200
started the first question after i

506
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,280
answered the third

507
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,360
and i was feeling like in the limbo like

508
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,160
with the machine who would randomly ask

509
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,399
me things

510
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,160
but i then realized he was just waiting

511
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,919
for the green light on the screen

512
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,280
to let me go and that green line

513
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,600
probably meant

514
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,559
um that the team outside was ready to

515
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,360
pick me up

516
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,480
and that's what happens so um i get into

517
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,799
the uk

518
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,520
and have people follow me like the whole

519
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,240


520
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,799
day not only on the way to the embassy

521
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:25,280
from the embassy back and so on

522
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:27,679
um i once spotted one of those persons

523
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,879
like sitting on a street level on the

524
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,720
other side

525
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,039
watching the whole time i was in an

526
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,000
office ground level

527
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,000
and because i had a bit of experience

528
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,880
with that in continental europe like in

529
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,880
germany

530
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,360
if you realize these guys go after you

531
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,200
and you put your camera on your table

532
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,879
or start even to make photos of them

533
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,960
they're very quickly gone because they

534
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,960
don't want to be you know relocated they

535
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,760
don't like to be exposed and so on

536
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,320
but the british behaved in this time

537
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,120
this scenario completely different

538
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,600
so he was like getting like you know

539
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,639
very aggressively body language like

540
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,240
spotting

541
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,000
looking back and so on so um that was a

542
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,320
little weird

543
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,080
that same day at three o'clock in the

544
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,678
night when my friends drove me to the

545
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,480
place where i was sleeping in a one-way

546
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,360
street

547
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,159
there was still a car following us um

548
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,719
even in the one-way street so actually

549
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,000
um he had to turn back and so on that

550
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,799
was no more

551
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
covered surveillance that was already

552
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,280
the the edge to

553
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,240
intimidation and then

554
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,399
over the next months i started to have

555
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,240
new favorites but not only in england

556
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,720
also in other countries

557
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,799
that i would see homeless looking like

558
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,280
people on the street level

559
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,840
um sitting there bagging or leaning to

560
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,678
some

561
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,120
buildings and at some point i had to

562
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,799
realize that the cheap

563
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,879
plastic bags they were wearing were just

564
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,400
a cover for cameras that

565
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,320
were actually with zoom and digital um

566
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,880
getting into my direction so that felt a

567
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,480
little hmm

568
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,120
and so the idea of this measurement if

569
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,039
you

570
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,439
look at their manuals which you'll find

571
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,120
somehow in the internet is

572
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,120
that the difference between discovered

573
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,439
survivals which is to find out where you

574
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,678
are

575
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,080
and to open the violence which i call

576
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,960
imitation intimidation surveillance

577
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,840
the idea is you you create in the person

578
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,840
in this case

579
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,760
in yeah for me a state of distress

580
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,000
so you're like constantly having this

581
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,720
like you know looking around

582
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,559
and you obviously have the idea

583
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,120
something is going on and they let you

584
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,360
know

585
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,439
they want to let you know and that's a

586
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:46,080
little weird

587
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:49,440
so in april 2018

588
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,399
uh actually in march 2018 um

589
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,720
i brought one of my crypto phones in

590
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,240
this case a desk phone based on a

591
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,440
zip phone called snom 870. um

592
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,919
back to our workshop here to

593
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,559
repair the display had been exposed to

594
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,600
heat and

595
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,840
got a little melted it's not so super

596
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,399
high quality lcd display

597
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,000
so i wanted just to display the to

598
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,320
replace the display so i opened the

599
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,360
thing

600
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,840
and i found actually a bug and that bark

601
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,120
um turned out to be very sophisticated

602
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,799
thing so

603
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,559
there was a battery pack there was a

604
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,360
shielded thing um

605
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,559
there was behind that shielded thing was

606
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,439
a module

607
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,039
that had been soldered into it was based

608
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,440
on an fpga

609
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,360
some hardware crypto elements 16

610
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,200
gigabyte of flash rom

611
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,760
it was completely passive so i wouldn't

612
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,320
have found it in any sweep because

613
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,000
it just recorded whatever i talked on

614
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,200
that encrypted phone

615
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,400
um and would be triggered by high

616
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,120
frequency

617
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,559
to send out the recorded stuff encrypted

618
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,039
in a brief signal

619
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,520
um you see here the url to find more

620
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:02,480
pictures online to give you an idea

621
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,480
this is the thing i found um this is how

622
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,679
it looked like at the beginning

623
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,679
it is the phone itself has two pcbs one

624
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,000
for the keyboard and one for the

625
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,679
you know connectors the processing and

626
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,760
so on

627
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,360
this was the modified version of the

628
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,520
keyboard pcb

629
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,039
with this battery pack in blue the

630
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,360
shielded module

631
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,158
and here you get an idea what was in

632
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,799
there

633
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,200
um that's pretty high tech we did of

634
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:32,320
course look into what exactly

635
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,960
do we have here when where this um

636
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:40,158
chips produced what does it do and so on

637
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,240
but um it's pretty obviously that this

638
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,600
is like for those who have read this

639
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,000
known documents intensely

640
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,918
it's what's called special collection

641
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,200
service inside there there's a group

642
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,480
called

643
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,520
targeted access target access operations

644
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,039
tao

645
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,760
and they work together with the thing

646
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,919
called pag the physical access group

647
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,200
that because someone and that was the

648
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,960
thing

649
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,640
it was not only built into this film

650
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,480
that phone had be of course

651
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,400
had been of course in a locked room and

652
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,200
i had to ask myself okay what happened

653
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,520
here

654
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,039
here you see how they grabbed the audio

655
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,120
with a glued

656
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:22,000
mini pcb from the other main controller

657
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,000
into their little technology and here

658
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,320
you see a comparison picture

659
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,480
to the right you see the original pcb

660
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,320
keyboard which has almost nothing

661
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,559
on it and to the left you see the

662
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,799
modified version

663
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:40,720
a friend of mine made a bit of a diagram

664
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,279
and yeah i'll just leave it for you you

665
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,679
can

666
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,120
review it later i'll upload these pdf

667
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,320
slides of course

668
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,000
um so here's some aspects of what was

669
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,240
going through my heart

670
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,360
over the time of course the first

671
00:24:52,240 --> 00:25:00,400
question was how long was this there

672
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:02,639
um no idea could be years

673
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,679
the components we identified were

674
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,360
produced

675
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:10,480
around or no earlier than

676
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,279
april 213 so if you remember

677
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,000
snowden came with this revelation mid of

678
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,960
213

679
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
roughly and i've been working for the

680
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,720
speaker

681
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,880
with others on this known documents next

682
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,760
to that phone and coordinating a lot of

683
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,679
it

684
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,000
in the year 213. so in theory it could

685
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,200
be

686
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,880
even related to that who knows um

687
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,400
the dimensions suggest clearly a

688
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,799
non-metric origin

689
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,600
the antenna would you know work in the

690
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:42,080
range of

691
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,080
um 800 megahertz so um you find here um

692
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,080
mentioning of a pdf that tells you

693
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,720
something about these groups

694
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,080
um but i did talk to some people who do

695
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,360
professional sweeping

696
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,120
meaning looking for audiobooks and so on

697
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,959
in devices and rooms

698
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,479
and they told me from the experience of

699
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,679
the cold war

700
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,320
until today the operation to bring

701
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,880
something

702
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,918
into a room into a device that's quite

703
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,600
an effort

704
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,480
because you need to secure you need to

705
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,039
ensure you don't get caught and so on

706
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,279
and so what you normally do is because

707
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,520
technology can fail is you do not

708
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,200
install one bark you install at least

709
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,158
two in the cold war

710
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,640
people told me from the elder generation

711
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,120
that

712
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,120
the relationship was one to eight so

713
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,559
that because technology failed a lot

714
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,840
back then

715
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:34,399
um however that made me of course think

716
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,039
okay what else could there be

717
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,039
you know what can i do to find the rest

718
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,039
and so on does it even make sense can i

719
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:44,320
secure all the rooms

720
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:46,640
that i use to work here and there in

721
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,158
such a way that i could be sure and of

722
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,799
course i can't be

723
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,159
so this was the first hard confrontation

724
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,240
with my own

725
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,919
cognitive dissonance because all that

726
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,640
you know surveillance theater where i

727
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,960
thought okay

728
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,640
julian has some trouble and i think i

729
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,480
have something to do with it and when i

730
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,120
travel to england okay they follow me

731
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,279
you know

732
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,158
you get used to that kind of things but

733
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,880
like

734
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,440
something you can have in your hand and

735
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,360
that's

736
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,120
outside of it incidents that means that

737
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,000
all your encrypted communications have

738
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,678
been listened to

739
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,679
well that feels shitty um so that's

740
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,080
what i call a hard confrontation with my

741
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:27,120
own cognitive dissonance

742
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,600
um the next thing i want to talk about

743
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,639
is very recent it's about one and a half

744
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,799
months out

745
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:38,000
old now when here in berlin um

746
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,120
i went out actually very early in the

747
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,440
morning

748
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,279
to get some stuff from the grocery in a

749
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,080
time of pandemic when i want to send the

750
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,159
shop at seven

751
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,360
something in the morning i come back

752
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,640
half an hour later

753
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:53,520
and the key to my apartment door does

754
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:57,360
not fit in the cylinder anymore

755
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,600
that felt a bit shitty um it was not a

756
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,559
normal cylinder it was a circle stealth

757
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,480
cylinder

758
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,480
um you might want to look at the

759
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,520
internet what it is it's a swiss company

760
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,159
who's doing

761
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,440
nice keys that you cannot photograph and

762
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,679
copy because

763
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,919
it has inner elements with a

764
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:17,679
sophisticated mechanical

765
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:20,720
a way of opening i did however

766
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:23,840
when i bumped into my door and had to

767
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,360
now first i called my locksmith dude

768
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,600
or my friend from the lock packing

769
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,719
industry i could say um

770
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:34,320
who had advised me to buy that cylinder

771
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,919
um we i talked with my lawyer and we

772
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,320
agreed it's a good idea to call the

773
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,880
police to put it on the other list of

774
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,200
things that i had collected until then

775
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,080
um i then realized that i had been

776
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,640
followed that

777
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,320
morning but i didn't take any attention

778
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,320
to it because i was just walking you

779
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,559
know in half automatic mode to the

780
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,320
grocery and there was a couple talking

781
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,080
such a

782
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,080
they will probably listen to this talk

783
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,158
and will remember that dialogue it was

784
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,080
just not making any sense but i was too

785
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,120
polite to point it out

786
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,439
and they were very closely so it was

787
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,760
not about where i was going it was about

788
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,000
that i was not at home so they

789
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,840
ensured that in the time frame that i

790
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,360
was there the other guys could operate

791
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,399
and so on

792
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,840
um yeah that is an ongoing investigation

793
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,158
but i can tell you this is

794
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,360
the next accident where like incident

795
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,000
where like um

796
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,600
cognitive dissonance and the illusion

797
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,440
you want to give his of you know i'm not

798
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,000
important in this game yeah these guys

799
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,799
follow me

800
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,440
here and there and they this feels kind

801
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,679
of different this is no more nice

802
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,279
um here's a little bit of a you get the

803
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,200
idea of the cylinder

804
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,720
you cannot really see the object that

805
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,720
was inserted but

806
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,200
at the end we didn't get it out for

807
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,279
forensic reasons we had to drill

808
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,399
police went through the apartment and so

809
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,960
on um

810
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,158
yeah another interesting day you can

811
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,520
have

812
00:29:54,159 --> 00:30:01,279
um so here's some aspects

813
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:04,559
um that i asked myself

814
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,120
so was it even my cylinder that i can

815
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,440
open

816
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:12,239
maybe they could not lockpick

817
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,799
the original stealth cylinder i had they

818
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,760
had to

819
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:17,279
open it in a violent way they were in

820
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,559
the apartment to

821
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,799
whatever put another bug in there

822
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,879
but as they couldn't replace it with the

823
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,440
original cylinder as they had destroyed

824
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,679
it

825
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,679
like they put another one in and that's

826
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,799
why my key wasn't fitting

827
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,440
it's an option next option wasn't maybe

828
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,080
a trap

829
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,760
to make me replace the broken cylinder

830
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,480
with a cheaper one with a more simple

831
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:45,360
one that they could open down afterwards

832
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:48,640
when i was gone next option

833
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,959
or maybe was it not about the door at

834
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,840
all was it maybe just to freak me out

835
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,240
um of course it feels not so great if

836
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,240
you

837
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,360
can't open your own apartment door and

838
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,279
so on

839
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,439
um and the fourth question was of course

840
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,880
oh gosh how much time did i spend that

841
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,440
day with you know

842
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,080
with the police was drilling open the

843
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,679
door

844
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,439
with all that kind of things it more or

845
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,559
less cost me a day

846
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,840
um and what may be

847
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:18,879
happened to my to my machines

848
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:22,240
meaning my computers my other things

849
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,320
maybe where was my attention not

850
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,320
in that time frame because it could be

851
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,918
it was a pure distraction thing

852
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,360
it would freak him out a little bit and

853
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,120
while he's freaking out

854
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,559
we do other things in his office or

855
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,840
whatever

856
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,480
i can't rule it out um and then of

857
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,320
course

858
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,320
i mean the police sent me some funny

859
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,960
questions i'm still working on that like

860
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,158
yeah should i name pompeo as a suspect

861
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,279
not sure

862
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,600
but um maybe i should i'm

863
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,000
discussing it with my lawyer and so on

864
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,959
and also is it maybe related to the date

865
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,440
this was the

866
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,039
third of november um just in case to

867
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,880
have it said the third of november is

868
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,240
the election day or was the election day

869
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,480
in the united states

870
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,039
and there was some accusation with john

871
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,080
had something to do with the election

872
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:13,039
some years ago so

873
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:15,519
however the next event

874
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,799
the incident number three has to do with

875
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,880
something that happened

876
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,080
in between because on monday the day

877
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,840
before they

878
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,360
messed up with my door i had shipped

879
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,639
some documents to spain

880
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,760
i realized then um that was legal

881
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,399
documents that

882
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,320
required me and a friend going to the

883
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,399
spanish embassy we gave

884
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,720
a tower power fraternity and so on

885
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,879
because we are also accusing this

886
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,200
company uc global which i talked about

887
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,279
last year which was the company

888
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,279
um running the surveillance or the

889
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,039
protections of ireland at the beginning

890
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,640
on behalf of the ecuadoreans in that

891
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,200
embassy and later it turned out to be

892
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,240
working for shadow anderson's company

893
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,440
or at least having a site arrangement

894
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,120
there

895
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,039
which is still subject to an ongoing

896
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,080
lawsuit and we participate in that

897
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,480
lawsuit because

898
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,559
not only julian was bite on everybody

899
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,600
was right on who was visiting him

900
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:11,360
and so on so i had ship documents

901
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:14,080
on that monday almost six o'clock

902
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,559
um on the local post office here by dhl

903
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,080
express i put that documents in a sealed

904
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,320
bag that's like

905
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,639
a bag was a serial number and so on that

906
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,960
went together with the describing list

907
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,120
was inside the bag into a white envelope

908
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,840
that again i sealed with you know

909
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,000
seal tape um then i gave that to the

910
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,080
post office but they insisted it gets in

911
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,720
a dhl express bag that's what you get

912
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:40,320
for the 70 euro

913
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:43,200
to be arriving within two days um

914
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,399
so um yeah the stuff arrived on

915
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,760
wednesday

916
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:49,600
but um all opened and um

917
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,000
the spanish lawyers freaked completely

918
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,559
out they were very sure

919
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,039
that this was a meddling um you would

920
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:00,559
see that it was sliced open and so on

921
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,080
yes you see this funny uh duct tape here

922
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:05,120
called soil

923
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,600
but why would the german customs

924
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,520
open a document shipment within europe

925
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,879
that just not makes a lot of sense it's

926
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,119
still

927
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,560
on the way to be checked in theory they

928
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,919
could do that

929
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,159
but also this incident has some aspects

930
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,480
it's a breach of client privilege that's

931
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,159
why the spanish lawyers insisted us we

932
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,240
bring this to a criminal

933
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,000
complaint they did on their end right

934
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:31,759
when they received it and

935
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
they made this photos um so was german

936
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,639
customs even involved it was just a duct

937
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,359
tape used by some funny people

938
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,159
um why when i emailed all this to my

939
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,799
lawyer with the picture sensor one

940
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,720
why did he not receive the email until

941
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,760
he realized on monday that it somehow

942
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:53,118
ended in his trash

943
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,440
he also freaked out and um

944
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,119
then i talked with dhl of course i made

945
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,119
a big fuss there and they were like no

946
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,680
we cannot tell you on which legal

947
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,000
grounds the shipment was open we cannot

948
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,319
tell

949
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,160
you who did it but if you have an

950
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,320
enquiry why don't you

951
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,279
send it to the custom so without giving

952
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,320
me even which

953
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,560
customs entity it would be or whatever

954
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,040
and again of course this is kind of an

955
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,200
interesting story but i have

956
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,560
normally other priorities in my life so

957
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,720
i'm asking myself

958
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,440
oh gosh how many days shall i waste here

959
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,399
with finding out to open the

960
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,480
shipment um but you know this is again

961
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,760
the state of distress this is again the

962
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,760
the effort

963
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,440
and it's again a reminder we are after

964
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,320
you we check your things we don't like

965
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,280
you're

966
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,880
um suing the cra suspected company and

967
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,720
so on and so on

968
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,839
um so coming to a bit of a conclusion of

969
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,078
this talk

970
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,759
as we also want to have time for for

971
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,000
questions and so on

972
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,000
um i want to talk about three aspects

973
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,400
the one is the elephant in the room and

974
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,560
the problem of the missing socks so

975
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:04,079
at some point um i don't want to

976
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,240
say that i have been completely not in a

977
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,960
state of distress you know so

978
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,118
i don't know how this affects my sanity

979
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,320
and those people surrounding me

980
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,720
so your cognitive systems get kind of

981
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,440
otherwise triggered and you start to see

982
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,200
these things

983
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,760
everywhere and when then you wash some

984
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,439
socks

985
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,119
and it turns out there's a sock missing

986
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,760
the other players in my life was like

987
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,000
okay cia

988
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,920
however i did suspect the bad sheets and

989
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,640
we found one of the socks in a bad sheet

990
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,119
so

991
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,040
when you know the problem is socks get

992
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,480
in the drum sometimes hanging you watch

993
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,079
something different than like a bad

994
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,760
sheet and a bad sheet is an excellent

995
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,680
place to hide things that

996
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,960
have been in the drama than get into the

997
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,720
bad sheet and you

998
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,160
just try it with it and you don't even

999
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,319
realize it and so on

1000
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:56,879
so while i'm a complete um

1001
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,720
for entertainment reasons also for you

1002
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,599
know you need to relax your brain

1003
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,279
in such a situation once a while i'm

1004
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,359
totally okay to say

1005
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,119
this here is responsible for everything

1006
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,759
including the missing socks but

1007
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,760
suspect the bad sheet first and realize

1008
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,960
that yes this is a joke and this is

1009
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,599
escapism

1010
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,880
and it helps you maybe to stay sane for

1011
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,320
the little moment

1012
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,320
but in the long term i don't know so

1013
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,240
and that's the the i don't know part is

1014
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,440
the other two slides that are coming out

1015
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,040
so what should i do

1016
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,040
and i should invite some friends and

1017
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,720
declare my office here

1018
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:35,200
um like a laboratory for surveillance

1019
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,040
um yeah it has been before i looked at

1020
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,640
survivors technology but in this case

1021
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,240
it's the violence technology looking at

1022
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,520
me and my friends so it's

1023
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:47,118
slightly different um it's maybe

1024
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,440
also important to not get into some kind

1025
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,960
of

1026
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,720
auto response mode when things happen

1027
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,119
because i was thinking i said what the

1028
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,598
 why are they doing all these things

1029
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,839
it cost them money it costs them effort

1030
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,280
um is it to freak me out is it that they

1031
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,240
think that like

1032
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,320
like um like i'm seriously in such an

1033
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,319
evil mode organization that

1034
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,839
you know they will escalate things and i

1035
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,880
will start to throw

1036
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:15,119
bombs at the u.s embassy or i don't know

1037
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,480
um i have no idea what their idea is

1038
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,599
there but i would just

1039
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:23,440
try to stay like slow motion

1040
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,800
and think about it um the next aspect is

1041
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,040
however

1042
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,599
do i infect other people and now i'm not

1043
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,920
talking about my paranoia

1044
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,680
or my situational awareness as i would

1045
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,720
call it

1046
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,040
which of course at some point is ongoing

1047
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,720
and

1048
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:44,640
it's no more sometimes um but

1049
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:47,520
when i talk with normal people with

1050
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,160
other journalists with people i deal

1051
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,440
with for

1052
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:54,560
normal things and they visit me and we

1053
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,720
do whatever kind of social uh

1054
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,880
things like normal things like having

1055
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,118
food and afterwards they re

1056
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,800
they call me a day later and say oh

1057
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,960
finally my phone started

1058
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,920
rebooting twice yesterday and and these

1059
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,760
kind of things

1060
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,200
so that you think okay it's not my

1061
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,400
paranoia that

1062
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,040
um is infectious it's actually they

1063
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,119
obviously

1064
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,880
want to not only know what kind of

1065
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,800
people i'm dealing with and look into

1066
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,240
their technology they also want to freak

1067
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,280
them out so

1068
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:26,399
this is um not cool and

1069
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,040
it also means that the type of ignorance

1070
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,119
you could

1071
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,480
normally apply and say well ignorance is

1072
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,280
a bless

1073
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,800
come on let's have have a nice day and

1074
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,800
forget about all this that's kind of

1075
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,480
limited that's no more an option

1076
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,960
um and also while i've been dealing

1077
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,119
um with that type of stress and that

1078
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,680
type of thing for a while now

1079
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,320
and i can say yeah well that's how it is

1080
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,759
um

1081
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:54,800
and um it doesn't mean that everybody

1082
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,400
dealing with you can do that

1083
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,839
there's people who are seriously freaked

1084
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,119
out by such a situation

1085
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:03,359
and they it craze fear it creates

1086
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,160
anger stress and so on so that's not

1087
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,359
cool

1088
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,799
so um my last slide and it ends up with

1089
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,839
a question to you guys is

1090
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,880
how to get out of this mess um

1091
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,200
so you know option one i managed to get

1092
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,640
proper authorities to make the ca stop

1093
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:23,759
acting illegal okay i heard the laughing

1094
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,480
i know this is ridiculous um but you

1095
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,040
know it would be so beautiful

1096
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,680
justice prevails um the german

1097
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,839
authorities the european ones pick it up

1098
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,078
i finally managed to escalate it to the

1099
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,599
guinness and by shaft i do not have to

1100
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,160
talk with the german intelligence

1101
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:43,599
services as i'm not sure they would be

1102
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,480
helpful in this game um and they make

1103
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,599
the stop

1104
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,880
the cra stop acting illegal and

1105
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,000
against me and the other person

1106
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:55,040
surrounding beautiful dream but

1107
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:59,119
okay not very realistic maybe option two

1108
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:01,440
pompeo realizes jesus loves wikileaks

1109
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,520
and whatever shall become true will

1110
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,200
become true he reads it on the bible

1111
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,560
pompeo seems to be if you look at his

1112
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,439
twitter account

1113
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,560
a reasonable belief in jesus christ and

1114
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,800
all that thing

1115
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,599
so he realizes it's all wrongdoing

1116
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,599
against julian

1117
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,319
wikileaks and all the people targeted in

1118
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:21,359
that context and stops it

1119
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:24,000
i know okay happens

1120
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,759
welcome good um if that's realistic i

1121
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,960
don't know you tell me

1122
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,880
um and the third option uh i don't know

1123
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,839
maybe you have some ideas and that's my

1124
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,960
question to you

1125
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:38,078
the audience um and that's the end of my

1126
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,400
prepared part of the

1127
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,400
talk

1128
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,599
and with these words uh thank you andy

1129
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,880
for the brilliant

1130
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:51,119
talk in the meantime i'm

1131
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,920
i i received some message uh a third

1132
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,800
option would be to have a great win yard

1133
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,359
wine yacht sorry um i personally love

1134
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,119
you

1135
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,640
it's completely right i considered

1136
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,400
actually maybe i should do something

1137
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,118
with ghosts become a farmer

1138
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,480
or you know yeah there's these options

1139
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,119
but i thought before i

1140
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,160
you know give it up and find my way on

1141
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,200
the countryside

1142
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,640
um i outsource the problem to the

1143
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,839
community and see what they think

1144
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:23,598
in the meantime i think there is uh

1145
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:27,200
plenty of time for a great white wine

1146
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:29,920
but to our questions we have indeed

1147
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,118
plenty of questions the first question

1148
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,960
would be

1149
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,560
how would you compare the civilians of

1150
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,079
the cia or other

1151
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:42,480
to the civilians of the gdr so for the

1152
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:45,440
deutsche democratic republic um

1153
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,319
well i'm born in hamburg in west germany

1154
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,359
i lived in

1155
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:51,119
east germany when the government was

1156
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,720
already falling into pieces it was

1157
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:57,200
technically still there

1158
00:42:52,720 --> 00:43:00,959
so i'm not the best person to compare it

1159
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:03,680
but i did talk with a person i know

1160
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,440
who worked for the foreign intelligence

1161
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,359
services because there was

1162
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,880
you know i simplified here of course the

1163
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,000
incidents a little bit there was one

1164
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,400
scene when later

1165
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,200
i went into my kitchen that day when my

1166
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,319
door

1167
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,439
lock got tampered with and i found a

1168
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,839
blue

1169
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,520
plastic glove and i don't have blue

1170
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,359
classic gloves and i asked my lucksmas

1171
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,759
guy he was like no it's not from me and

1172
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:27,598
the police had black ones so

1173
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,680
and i thought hmm what the maybe

1174
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,960
the guys have been inside the apartment

1175
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,640
which i didn't thought

1176
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,800
earlier because it was second log and

1177
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,160
the police checked and so on

1178
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,960
um and then i talked to discuss it with

1179
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,359
this

1180
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,480
person i know he's a kind friendly man

1181
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,160
who was working in the foreign

1182
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,400
intelligence of that

1183
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,560
country and so and he was like you look

1184
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,119
you have to look at it from a cost

1185
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,440
effectiveness point of view like that

1186
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:56,079
piece of plastic cost you 10 cent

1187
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,640
nothing and it freaks you out three

1188
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,720
months

1189
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:03,200
so see how much how cost effective it is

1190
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,399
and i mean that's a good aspect um

1191
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,480
that's a good point

1192
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,880
and so i think that the east german

1193
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,520
stasi the guys the eastern intelligence

1194
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,599
guys

1195
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,839
they also they knew very well the

1196
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,560
difference and they had both instruments

1197
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,680
in their

1198
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,000
you know in their uh program to either

1199
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,960
do

1200
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,079
coverts of violence to really like not

1201
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,960
let you know

1202
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,640
and the department for we let him know

1203
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,880
and see how he reacts or

1204
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:33,040
we let him know because he's ongoing

1205
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,599
doing things and we want him to

1206
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,680
you know stop it and and get intimidated

1207
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,880
and so on not get scared maybe or his

1208
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,960
wife gets scared or

1209
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,440
these kind of things so i think it is

1210
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,480
comparable

1211
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,280
cool uh oh well not cool

1212
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,000
um speaking of uh covered versus uh over

1213
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,440
civilians

1214
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:57,200
syrian story as you now know

1215
00:44:53,440 --> 00:45:00,560
does it still bother you emotionally

1216
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,839
um well what bothers me sometimes

1217
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:05,920
is you know it's also it has

1218
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:07,440
sometimes it's nice to be alone and it's

1219
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,480
sometimes nice

1220
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:13,280
to not think about the ca

1221
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:16,079
guys um being in the apartment next door

1222
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:19,680
or in my case an apartment under me

1223
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:23,280
or in in surrounding environments

1224
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,560
um but thinking about normal things like

1225
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,640
playing a puzzle or

1226
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,880
seeing some funny spy movies oh wait

1227
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,920
that's

1228
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,599
almost relaxing no seriously um at some

1229
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,720
point it sucks a little bit

1230
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:39,440
i i can't kind of deal with it

1231
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,799
um but i mean this 20 20 year has of

1232
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,040
course complicated

1233
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,480
um or has made it almost impossible to

1234
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,000
travel so normally i

1235
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,079
escape my intensity of my work situation

1236
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,680
with travels maybe

1237
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:56,240
um i can do that this year so i it feels

1238
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,839
a little more intense and it it annoys a

1239
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,598
little bit and i would like to get these

1240
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:05,200
guys out of my life and do something

1241
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,200
useful with their life or whatever

1242
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:14,959
yeah the next question um

1243
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:14,960
he or she or the person or

1244
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,680
creature probably missed it do you

1245
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,520
disassemble all your devices on a

1246
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,879
regular base

1247
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,480
no i usually do just irregular and seal

1248
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,680
them

1249
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,760
in this case um the seal had

1250
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,879
had an issue with the with the heat as

1251
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,960
well so i

1252
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,400
and i was lousy on checking it i have to

1253
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,040
say um

1254
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,440
so yes that's something i mean if you

1255
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,000
have

1256
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,960
one office you can do that i tend to

1257
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,160
work on different continents even and

1258
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,599
that um turned out to be a bit of an

1259
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,598
issue

1260
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,000
so yes you need to have safes everywhere

1261
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:57,680
and seals and

1262
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:01,200
but even then you know um pompeo

1263
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,799
seems to have justified um or have given

1264
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:06,640
orders to do these things

1265
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,839
no matter the costs and my expectation

1266
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,920
to have like a

1267
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:12,560
private or in secure encrypted channels

1268
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,599
so it's

1269
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,160
very limited for a while watching that

1270
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,560
effort

1271
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,160
the encryption of the kryptophone

1272
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,160
obviously was good otherwise they

1273
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,720
wouldn't have had the effort to

1274
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,200
you know build something in but um at

1275
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,399
the

1276
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:31,279
end of the day um for me um

1277
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,880
it has the same impact it's like well

1278
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,359
yeah it's a phone

1279
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,119
it's a piece of device it's in a room

1280
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,640
the room has windows

1281
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,640
we've seen what they've done with the

1282
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:44,078
embassy windows and so on

1283
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,640
so it's like yeah security what a nice

1284
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,839
idea

1285
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,839
but it doesn't really exist

1286
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,359
yeah um do you try giving a few coins to

1287
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,640
the homeless looking people

1288
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:58,078
to do either some reverse intimidation

1289
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,598
or good deed

1290
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:04,480
if they are not cia yeah that's uh

1291
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:06,640
i mean i had this one particular

1292
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,920
situation where i was

1293
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,118
waiting for someone on a kind of a

1294
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,720
shopping street

1295
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:16,240
and i just i just thought something is

1296
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,520
wrong with the guy but when

1297
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,000
i saw the camera and son he also rushed

1298
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,880
away

1299
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,960
so no i didn't give them the money the

1300
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:28,319
second scenario

1301
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:30,559
um now but it's a good idea um the thing

1302
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:33,520
is that what i started to do

1303
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:35,440
is to always have a camera with me that

1304
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,839
turns out for me to be important to be

1305
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,079
able to document things and also

1306
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:42,160
most of them except the british don't

1307
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:43,599
like it when they are being photographed

1308
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,200
and you

1309
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,040
either they it's very interesting

1310
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,640
because normal people do realize when

1311
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,000
they are being photographed but these

1312
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,000
guys are either

1313
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,079
pretending no i don't see that you

1314
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,240
photograph me you know they look

1315
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,319
but a little bit with too much energy

1316
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,439
away at the moment

1317
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:03,279
or they are seriously disturbed and go

1318
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,280
away

1319
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,480
so the best uh solution would be to have

1320
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,160
the boldest

1321
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:12,480
biggest largest camera uh always by hand

1322
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,640
yeah let me say it like this i mean i've

1323
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,200
not been afraid of survivan's technology

1324
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:20,720
and for sure not of cctv for a

1325
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:23,598
long part of my life but i start to

1326
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:26,720
like the idea of cctv at some places in

1327
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:28,800
my own environment i'm sorry to say that

1328
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,319
but there's compromises you can make

1329
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,079
like survival feed

1330
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,599
you know other parts you don't always

1331
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:35,680
need the faces

1332
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,079
and if you need the faces yeah there's

1333
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,000
options

1334
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,119
and still analog photography is a great

1335
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,720
thing

1336
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:47,200
but that's my personal opinion um

1337
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,480
you maybe you want to you can talk maybe

1338
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,960
you cannot talk about

1339
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,920
um do you use other counter measurements

1340
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,599
um

1341
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,240
you want to talk about or you can talk

1342
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:58,240
about now i obviously don't want to talk

1343
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:01,359
about it but i mean i've been

1344
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:05,279
um i was wondering um

1345
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:08,160
myself how um

1346
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,160
why i had this rather intense things

1347
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,480
going on in me i was wondering is it the

1348
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:15,520
time frame is it me as a person

1349
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:18,720
it might have to do with actually being

1350
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,599
in this uh funny scene of course i've

1351
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,759
i've learned

1352
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,640
i mean i know lock picking parisons i've

1353
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,040
always

1354
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,118
had an eye on having good locks based on

1355
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,680
their advice and understanding how easy

1356
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,680
it would be

1357
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:35,359
otherwise and using encryption was also

1358
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:37,040
not always about let like

1359
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:39,040
hiding something it was just good

1360
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,040
practice of having privacy and

1361
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,440
operational security

1362
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,480
so for me that was very normal for many

1363
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,960
years to do that

1364
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,880
and maybe you know compared to other

1365
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,359
persons that made me more interesting i

1366
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,640
don't know

1367
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:55,359
i'll find out one day um but

1368
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,040
i think it's a good idea for everybody

1369
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,598
involved to think about these three

1370
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,759
aspects

1371
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:04,960
physical security encryption and also

1372
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,839
uh what kind of ways do you have to

1373
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,960
realize if something is being tampered

1374
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:10,960
with

1375
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,200
yeah and that's not necessarily

1376
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:15,119
monitoring i mean monitoring can help

1377
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,960
but on the other hand side

1378
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:19,520
yeah with monitoring systems they can

1379
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:24,160
also deal with

1380
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:24,160
like physical checksums kind of

1381
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,319
our next question uh do you ask the

1382
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:31,119
police at the border if everything is

1383
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,119
prepared now

1384
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,280
uh you mean not the british border

1385
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,520
probably that's the reference to

1386
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,520
i don't travel to the uk anymore i

1387
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,559
decided you know after they dealt with

1388
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,640
julian there

1389
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,839
i don't like that place anymore i never

1390
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,000
felt so

1391
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:47,759
well there and actually maybe i forgot

1392
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,319
to mention that um

1393
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,880
after this kind of treatment at the

1394
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:54,319
border

1395
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,720
started i also started avoiding sleeping

1396
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:59,680
in the uk so i made day trips

1397
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,839
sometimes in order to get the last plane

1398
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,480
out of the country i was flying to tsuri

1399
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,160
first

1400
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,920
because it was a late flight thing to

1401
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,680
julian then next morning to berlin i

1402
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,599
felt uncertain better

1403
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,040
at the bar of fish hitting hotel than in

1404
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:15,200
london central city with

1405
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:17,200
um yeah the special relationship

1406
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:20,879
as it's called between the intelligence

1407
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:23,520
of the uk and those of the us

1408
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,520
i see

1409
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,160
speaking of sleeping or in this case

1410
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,240
concerning your apartment

1411
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,558
that question would be would some home

1412
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:35,680
surveillance system brings some

1413
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:37,839
relief for example

1414
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,680
well that's like that's like a change in

1415
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:42,400
devil with the other dude right

1416
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,759
i mean um no i'm not really a friend of

1417
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,920
that but yes of course

1418
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,880
i had to at the end of the day at least

1419
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:52,559
check with my door and

1420
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:54,720
so on what i can do to detect and record

1421
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,920
things and so on but it's not a pleasure

1422
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,118
it's not like

1423
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,680
[Music]

1424
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,680
i don't know i mean yes you you end up

1425
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,240
doing that kind of but that's not

1426
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,480
how life on planet earth should be

1427
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,279
yeah yeah so it's it's a kind of a

1428
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,720
trade-off

1429
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,640
um for what return and yeah i mean

1430
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,279
the thing is i mean look i'm a german

1431
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:17,200
citizen what i'm doing is constitutional

1432
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,640
protected i live in the governmental

1433
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,240
district of berlin

1434
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:24,879
it's fairly safe here but

1435
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,959
you know i have friends in other places

1436
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,480
other situation in life is completely

1437
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,599
different there

1438
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:34,640
and um that is more

1439
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:35,599
what worries me that i'm in a relatively

1440
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,359
cool position

1441
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,040
secure position that's why i can talk

1442
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,680
about these things but i have friends

1443
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,880
who

1444
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:44,480
have a more severe situation and they

1445
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,319
are not sure they should talk about it

1446
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:51,760
to not escalate things and that's

1447
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:51,759
a very tricky choice to make maybe

1448
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,119
yes indeed

1449
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,640
that brings us to another question and i

1450
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:02,000
think this is a perfect

1451
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:04,160
point to mention that uh can we do

1452
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,359
what can we do to support you in getting

1453
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:08,160
out of this mess

1454
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:09,440
and what can we do in general for this

1455
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,440
well i really

1456
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,119
appreciate the question i don't have a

1457
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:16,160
good answer but i think

1458
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,359
um yes i would like to discuss more with

1459
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:20,879
people

1460
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:22,880
about what can be done um i mean i'm

1461
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,119
for the moment i'm dealing with police

1462
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:28,720
lawyers the

1463
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:32,800
speaker guys i'm working with they also

1464
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:35,839
find some ways maybe to address it um

1465
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:38,640
but it seems like at least if it comes

1466
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:41,160
to julian situation things are

1467
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,279
badly escalated and it's all a bit

1468
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,879
interrelated so

1469
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,280
i don't have a good answer at this

1470
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,839
moment but i

1471
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,839
think it's a good idea to discuss it

1472
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:54,319
more and

1473
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:54,640
um so maybe identifying other people who

1474
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:56,960
are

1475
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,319
in some kind of a risk situation because

1476
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,520
these things happens and

1477
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:03,680
as i maybe hopefully was able to show

1478
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,880
it's not that difficult to get into such

1479
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:08,078
a message

1480
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,839
it happened yeah and

1481
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,000
speaking of discussing you mentioned

1482
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:14,240
earlier there is a big blue button

1483
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,359
to discuss any further you will find it

1484
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,160
in the 2d

1485
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:20,000
area in a 2d world in the whistleblower

1486
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:22,399
wiki is it right

1487
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,480
yes in the tent actually i was told and

1488
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,119
the tent is the url to the big blue

1489
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,559
button or

1490
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:32,319
somehow it's interlinked there

1491
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:32,799
so again please go out explore the 2d

1492
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:36,400
world

1493
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:40,240
and of course there was a blower tent

1494
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,240
we still have some minutes left

1495
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,359
how do you do mentally did you use any

1496
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:49,359
methods to keep your head clean

1497
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:52,240
or clear and freak out

1498
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:54,640
uh yeah that's a good question um i

1499
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:57,759
drink too much vodka but

1500
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:00,879
i try to keep it with good quality

1501
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:04,240
um let me say it like this

1502
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:07,359
um the real trouble is

1503
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,160
maybe that well in this scene here

1504
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,558
people

1505
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,480
have a rough understanding of this type

1506
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:16,559
of things already

1507
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:18,960
um i also liked

1508
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,400
to have or to to be around with people

1509
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,640
who have nothing to do with

1510
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,440
i.t with security with all these kind of

1511
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:28,640
things so-called normal people sometimes

1512
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:31,920
it's refreshing to be with them but

1513
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:35,200
their ability to understand this mess

1514
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,200
is a little bit limited

1515
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:42,160
so um it's i think others judge better

1516
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:43,040
how i'm doing mentally i'm trying to

1517
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,240
keep my head

1518
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:47,680
up and i'm finding a good way out but if

1519
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:51,200
anyone has a good idea

1520
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:54,960
i'm really all for listening

1521
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:57,680
and see what's possible

1522
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,799
in this case i can can come back to the

1523
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:02,000
vineyard

1524
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:05,520
it's pretty relaxing to have work

1525
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:08,319
in the late autumn all right

1526
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,119
even during a pandemic okay you just

1527
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:12,160
have to

1528
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:13,040
find a way there yeah it's outside and

1529
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,598
it's a

1530
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,880
a lot of distance between the people i

1531
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:20,160
think this will work

1532
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,920
um so the last question um red or white

1533
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:27,839
wine

1534
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:27,839
red red wine red yeah definitely

1535
