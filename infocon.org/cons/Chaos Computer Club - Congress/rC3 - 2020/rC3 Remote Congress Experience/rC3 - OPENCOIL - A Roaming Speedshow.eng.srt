speedy and today uh we're gonna

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,920
talk about open coil um what it is

9
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,680
what it is not uh our motivation for

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,399
this project

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,280
the technology behind it uh technology

12
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,119
reused

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,400
and some funny things we encountered

14
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,640
along the way um stay

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,439
until the end because we will be sharing

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,040
some of

17
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,279
um yeah our builds so you can replicate

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,840
replicate this yourself

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,600
um please enjoy the talk this is all

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,880
live so we're not sure what's gonna

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,240
happen

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,039
but we have a trusted clipboard here so

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,119
i'm confident we can do this how about

24
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,320
you speedy

25
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,200
well we'll find out right so um let's

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,559
dive right in

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,479
um what is open coil um you can see a

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,759
bunch of uh

29
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:47,280
scooters around us here um open coil

30
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,560
uh open coil basically um is a concept

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,399
for a mobile art show on um these

32
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,360
dockles electric sharing vehicles or

33
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,840
in short vehicles that can be rented by

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,119
a

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:05,360
app um it ran for one week

36
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:07,759
end of october this year basically

37
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,000
the two of us we came up with this

38
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,520
concept and we then invited

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,440
um 10 artists to

40
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,879
share their works with us and present

41
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,879
them on

42
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:24,079
these e-scooters open coil

43
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:27,760
builds on the idea

44
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:32,160
of the speed show as well as

45
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,319
offline art and some

46
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,599
maybe some influence of the dead drop as

47
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,280
well all

48
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:43,119
brilliant uh concepts by um media artist

49
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,959
again bartol we basically

50
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,640
for open coil we basically took these

51
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,680
ideas

52
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:53,799
and tried to merge them together

53
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:57,040
into a concept that then uses

54
00:02:53,800 --> 00:03:00,879
non-destructive add-ons that we

55
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:04,000
can put on these scooters

56
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:08,159
to host the

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,519
artworks by all the individual um

58
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:15,200
artists um basically

59
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,640
uh once these scooters are modified with

60
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,359
our add-on

61
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,000
we can release them into the streets and

62
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,280
they

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,879
become available for the public

64
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,560
in the whole micro mobility service area

65
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,280
um we came upon this idea because we

66
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,080
wanted

67
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,239
to interact with these micro mobility

68
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,599
services

69
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,720
basically open coil it

70
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,760
appropriates their infrastructure so

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,519
one thing that is out there for for

72
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,599
everyone to use and we

73
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,879
this open call concept it appropriates

74
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,000
this infrastructure

75
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:57,439
as a decentralized network of of nodes

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,959
scooters um and then we can share

77
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:04,640
artworks on all of them um

78
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,480
we the artists um we

79
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,040
we invited them we wrote them an email

80
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,679
about this idea we had

81
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,560
um and we told them okay so we're

82
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,599
looking for

83
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,959
a small art pieces art

84
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:22,320
um that can be stored on um

85
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,440
two megabytes of of storage and

86
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,440
the result well the response was

87
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,199
overwhelming to us as well because like

88
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,440
we we

89
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,280
got immediately got responses from a

90
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,960
bunch of really really really brilliant

91
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,239
artists out there and they all

92
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,198
helpful and supportive and um actually

93
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,360
created

94
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,960
most of the work that you can see or you

95
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,199
were able to see in

96
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,400
the show were created for this show

97
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,840
especially

98
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,960
and they were all then uh optimized

99
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,440
to be viewed on mobile devices since

100
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,159
this roaming speed show is actually well

101
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,680
decentralized and you would need to

102
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,560
go into public space find a scooter

103
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,680
connect with your phone to that scooter

104
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,639
via wi-fi

105
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,600
and then the artwork that was stored on

106
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,120
the

107
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,000
scooter was with was visible

108
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,960
for for the visitors of the of the art

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,479
show

110
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:24,159
um all all of the arts

111
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,960
all of the artworks are somewhat uh

112
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,520
concept

113
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,719
context specific words they all deal

114
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,240
with

115
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,280
either movement or um just capitalism in

116
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,840
general

117
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,280
um some of them even um with the

118
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,119
pandemic since

119
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,080
obviously this all came about um while

120
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,680
the pandemic was happening and the

121
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,919
concept really

122
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,520
um it wasn't really pandemic

123
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,560
driven but maybe accelerated since

124
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,758
um while we were already working on this

125
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,840
concept

126
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,759
we realized oh these all these

127
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,119
restrictions and

128
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:08,479
um yeah restrictions that came up on the

129
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,360
general gallery industry or

130
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,840
where you would go normally go as an art

131
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,600
enthusiast to to look at art

132
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,119
they were all sort of like limited in

133
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,199
what they were able to present

134
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,039
what they were able to offer and a lot

135
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,759
of the um

136
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,199
a lot of the uh galleries traditional

137
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,800
more traditional galleries

138
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,919
they then uh moved all of their

139
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,280
um available

140
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:38,479
shows to the online

141
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,599
some of them in very interesting and

142
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,120
creative ways

143
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,960
others really just pictures of

144
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,800
artworks they have hanging around in

145
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,280
their galleries and you could

146
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,240
just like click through a slideshow and

147
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,280
that basically

148
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,919
led to us thinking oh okay so how about

149
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,119
we take

150
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,240
our net art that is usually already

151
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,199
presented in the

152
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,160
online world and take them offline just

153
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,599
to show

154
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,720
okay so there's actually um maybe

155
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,280
different solutions that are still like

156
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,240
completely pandemic friendly to present

157
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,799
uh

158
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,080
art in the in the offline space other

159
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,240
than just

160
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:25,198
going online um

161
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:28,400
there is uh for example this work here

162
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,440
um it's sarah grant's contribution to

163
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,638
our show

164
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,160
um it's a little mobile game that

165
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,960
deals with pandemic um

166
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,800
as you have like you have to fight

167
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,080
little coronaviruses

168
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,520
and and it's it's like based in the city

169
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,639
of berlin which is

170
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,280
where open coil first first happened so

171
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,680
this

172
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,440
this work is really nice to show how

173
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,280
involved the artists were with

174
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:00,879
with the concept of open coil and

175
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,679
how creative they they got and and

176
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,759
to to develop art that is suitable for

177
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,599
this

178
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,720
um yeah uh so

179
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,680
in short we we had a

180
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,599
small gathering here in front of the

181
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,400
central finance in berlin to have like a

182
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,360
small

183
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,239
test opening to like for all the artists

184
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,560
and and

185
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,440
friends friends who like see the

186
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,240
artworks

187
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,240
and for us for us to test our hard and

188
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,159
software tests if everything

189
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,680
was working the way we was we supposed

190
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,240
uh we we thought that we thought it

191
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,559
would work and uh we found a couple of

192
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,080
bugs we found a couple of issues

193
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:47,839
which we then were able to um solve

194
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,440
in time for the official opening where

195
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,000
we would then release all of the

196
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,720
scooters onto the streets of berlin

197
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,680
to be actually fully publicly accessible

198
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,480
and then

199
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,079
um watch our scooters move uh through

200
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,360
berlin that is basically

201
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,040
the whole concept um maybe

202
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,480
speedy can say something or scooty can

203
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,519
say something about

204
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,360
why we even used scooters in the first

205
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,120
place

206
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:18,320
yeah so um like both individually were

207
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,279
already like very interested in in

208
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,279
this whole movie movement of these micro

209
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,399
mobility services

210
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,519
um in general

211
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,800
and especially scooters specifically

212
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,440
um it's

213
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,560
it's very strange to like overnight uh

214
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,680
be confronted

215
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:43,199
uh in your city um with a bunch of

216
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,760
of like highly technical uh

217
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,800
species occupying the same sort of

218
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,040
ecology as

219
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,920
you are um and this this really yeah

220
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,800
made us think like

221
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,599
like what are these these animals or or

222
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,399
things

223
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,399
or or species um

224
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,040
it it immediately triggered also

225
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,279
questions about

226
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:15,599
uh about public space itself um

227
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:18,640
whereas before it might have been

228
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,120
you know unnoticed um but all of a

229
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,480
sudden this this

230
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:28,000
semi-public space was was occupied by

231
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:32,560
like private private companies uh

232
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,720
vehicles and it just

233
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,800
brought up a lot of emotions and not

234
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,839
only like artists or researchers

235
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,560
but also like in with normal people

236
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,600
and you might have seen the gut

237
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,920
reactions of

238
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,360
a lot of people who could not park their

239
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,479
bike anymore on the streets

240
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,079
because it was occupied by a bunch of

241
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,519
scooters

242
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:58,640
um such as

243
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:02,160
yeah throwing them into the river or

244
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,720
you know breaking them on purpose and

245
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,360
while this is a reaction coming from

246
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,920
from the

247
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,000
people who are engaged suddenly they are

248
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,399
like they all experience the same

249
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,640
thing that we experienced that all of a

250
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,320
sudden overnight there are these

251
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,640
thousands of new well

252
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,800
things occupying the same space that we

253
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,560
regularly occupy or that we

254
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:31,359
um will live in and yeah that triggered

255
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:34,719
emotional responses uh and yeah a lot of

256
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,200
critique yeah and it's it's it's just

257
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,160
very

258
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,839
interesting to to see this sheer amount

259
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,560
of technology that these

260
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,120
species are carrying with them and how

261
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,640
this is

262
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:51,839
sort of dumped freely on the street to

263
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:53,839
to um yeah interact with

264
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,279
you know normally you would use a mobile

265
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,480
phone to rent these

266
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:01,439
uh randy's cars or scooters

267
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,320
and drive around and get charged from

268
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,320
your credit card

269
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:13,279
but yeah we were sort of

270
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:15,760
looking for ways to to um

271
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,720
yeah regain sort of agency in this in

272
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,720
this sort of

273
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,440
newly newly created ecology where uh

274
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,320
seemingly anyone can can occupy or take

275
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,600
this this

276
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,959
public good and we were very interested

277
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,720
in in the ways how these

278
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:35,839
companies also did this um

279
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,959
so yeah that that also led us to

280
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,360
today to the next to the next part um of

281
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,439
our

282
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,680
sort of interest um

283
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,880
like how to engage with these uh

284
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,079
scooters

285
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,959
um not by ranting them but uh

286
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,000
in a sort of public way so instead of

287
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,680
looking for

288
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,560
backdoors or bugs or whatever

289
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,199
um how can you engage with these these

290
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,160
practices of sharing vehicles

291
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,079
um venture capitalism in in ways that

292
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,360
are like publicly accessible

293
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,959
um without breaking anything

294
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:18,160
um yeah uh

295
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,959
so but by by sort of chance um was like

296
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,079
a year ago

297
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,599
we tried to to like charge a phone on a

298
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:29,359
scooter we found on the streets

299
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,959
and it would actually charge it without

300
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,519
renting it first so in a way

301
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,638
uh we discovered that uh we had like we

302
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:42,480
discovered free energy

303
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,800
um and then this is all right it's just

304
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,760
more or less yes yeah we we found the

305
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,160
first

306
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,600
uh entry point the first portal of

307
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,399
communication

308
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,000
that made it available to us uh to

309
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,120
engage the school scooters

310
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,680
um in a different way than that

311
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,320
maybe the the micro mobility service

312
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,680
intended

313
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:09,440
to and also um this just

314
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:12,959
opened up motivated us to do

315
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,959
to do a different approach

316
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,720
yeah so um there's actually two uh main

317
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,079
ingredients to our project

318
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,800
um that are actually focusing on

319
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,359
on how to publicly approach these things

320
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,920
um

321
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,560
one part is a software part and the

322
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,120
other part

323
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,119
as said before is a hardware element

324
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,479
so before going into the software maybe

325
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:41,519
you can we can briefly explain

326
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,800
that these models that are shown here

327
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,680
actually are outfitted with a little um

328
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,079
charging pad so under under the steering

329
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,760
wheel

330
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:55,120
there's a sort of clip where you can

331
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,360
mount your mobile phone on

332
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,800
and if it's compatible with wireless

333
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,000
charging

334
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,639
it will charge your phone while you're

335
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,519
driving it around which is nice because

336
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,360
yeah

337
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,000
if you rent this thing and you run out

338
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,920
of battery and you cannot lock it again

339
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,399
yeah you have a problem i mean

340
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,120
i don't like this service line um

341
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,320
without a

342
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,360
battery so this is a sort of nice

343
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,959
service that goes

344
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,360
both ways i guess um

345
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,119
the other part is the the the software

346
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,800
part um maybe speedy

347
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,839
you can yeah um basically

348
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,800
um after we discovered this first entry

349
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,480
point we

350
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,359
just tried to think of of other

351
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,079
things that this these micro mobility

352
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,720
services

353
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,719
will hand us for free that or or that

354
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,560
are publicly available

355
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,920
and um we found out okay so

356
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,399
the next major thing that these

357
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,000
that of this major like block of

358
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,120
information that they will release

359
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,759
um without account app anything

360
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,759
is uh the locations of their scooters

361
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,399
and their battery status and stuff like

362
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,079
that

363
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:17,040
it's all if you download their specific

364
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,239
server the specific services app um

365
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,079
you'll see

366
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,000
without even logging in creating an

367
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,439
account putting credit card

368
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,519
information down or anything you will

369
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,800
already be able to see

370
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:31,839
um where the scooters are located um

371
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:36,240
what is their uh license plate number or

372
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:38,480
um i like their their vehicle id um

373
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,920
as well as their their battery status

374
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,360
and um

375
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,479
basically we um looked a little deeper

376
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,079
and and then we've

377
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:51,839
we found um um just lying around

378
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,560
uh on the internet um we found uh an api

379
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,519
key that was previously discovered by a

380
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,399
guy who

381
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,040
discovered github a guy who put it on

382
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,360
the github

383
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:06,399
and which we found um and then this

384
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:09,839
this api key basically um gave us

385
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:13,520
the capabilities to uh run

386
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:15,359
api requests and like get responses with

387
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,720
all the information that we

388
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:23,359
needed to develop our open coil concept

389
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:28,160
further so basically

390
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:30,959
what we did we we built a website

391
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,000
for optimized for mobile devices

392
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,559
obviously that would

393
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,520
then um allow its visitors to locate

394
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,200
the scooters that we had modified and

395
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,760
totally those so

396
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,440
not all the scooters as in all the

397
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,960
schools that would usually show up in

398
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,960
your in your

399
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:54,160
app um just those scooters that had our

400
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,919
arch gallery modification on them

401
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,440
and we found out about different

402
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,080
statuses that these

403
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,880
scooters can have through the response

404
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,399
that we got from the api

405
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,720
for example if someone

406
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,760
rents out a scooter that has this

407
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,720
gallery space

408
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,679
its status obviously changes from

409
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,960
available

410
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,880
to unavailable so that um

411
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,400
another user of the micro mobility

412
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,720
services they wouldn't

413
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,919
see the scooter anymore on their app

414
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,160
because someone else is already using it

415
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,520
and we implemented these different

416
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,960
statuses in our

417
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,160
um in our website as well to um better

418
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,919
show

419
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,880
or or to well notify

420
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,960
visitors of our gallery when um a

421
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,120
scooter becomes unavailable because

422
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,640
it's either rented out or maybe it's

423
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,879
battery drained or

424
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,960
it got damaged overnight all these

425
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,559
different things we basically found out

426
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,840
while observing

427
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,320
the behavior of these um vehicles over

428
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,080
time

429
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,439
and we figured okay so there are all

430
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,960
these different um

431
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,559
statuses that um they can be in and

432
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:12,559
which we can implement in in our

433
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,480
um in our website to make um

434
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,960
to make it more clear to our visitors

435
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,000
which scooters are actually

436
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,960
available to be located in the wild

437
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,880
and watch the artwork that is on there

438
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:39,840
and which of them maybe

439
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:39,840
aren't anymore um yeah here

440
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,918
you

441
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,120
statuses that these scooters can be in

442
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,200
and it shows

443
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,239
a lot about the scooters and it always

444
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,280
shows their

445
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:30,400
current location um

446
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:35,120
so as soon as we basically had this

447
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:37,280
these tools we immediately noticed that

448
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,158
uh as soon as we like put these scooters

449
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,760
out we had very low expectations of

450
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:46,640
like the general life cycle of

451
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,919
or life expectancy of one of our modules

452
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,360
because looking at the schools and

453
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,400
looking how they were treated by the

454
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,559
public

455
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,960
we had we were like very um

456
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,039
curious to see if like how long our

457
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,159
modules will actually last and

458
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:05,520
um just looking at the map and like um

459
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,880
reloading it all the time um to see if

460
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:12,480
something changed um it

461
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,679
it was uh fun it was it has a fun

462
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,320
it has always it has us

463
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,760
it had us um physically engaged with the

464
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,879
scooters again because we were like

465
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,520
sitting at home and

466
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,919
um reloading the website all the time to

467
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,240
just

468
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,760
like to look where our scooters are

469
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,799
where our babies are

470
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,559
whether they need service and we would

471
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,520
then like every time something changed

472
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,678
every time like a

473
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,879
scooter's icon switch to like

474
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,080
maintenance or

475
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,799
um battery or something we would then um

476
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,360
like drive there and look if our module

477
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,080
is damaged in any way or if it's like

478
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,479
broken if it's still working and through

479
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,600
through

480
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,360
through this engagement we um

481
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:58,799
yeah we've we just um

482
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,439
found out so much more about how these

483
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,158
services

484
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,159
operate and how um

485
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,919
yeah how the scooters are actually used

486
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,280
um

487
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,080
and yeah we we were taking good care of

488
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,360
these

489
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,080
like modules that we had put on which is

490
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,799
the

491
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,840
the hardware part of our um of our

492
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,240
concept

493
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,158
and maybe we can tell something more

494
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,840
about that

495
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:31,280
yeah so up until now um

496
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:34,559
there wasn't a single hack really

497
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,600
um we are we've just been using

498
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:41,440
like uh publicly available um

499
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,600
accessible resources to build like an

500
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,320
alternative infrastructure on top of an

501
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,320
existing one

502
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,520
as speedy just showed we created a map

503
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,440
to

504
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,440
to track all the vehicles we had

505
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,400
outfitted with

506
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,600
with our sort of hardware implant or

507
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,600
parasite if you like

508
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:09,120
which is basically uh a replica of the

509
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,240
existing uh charging port for your

510
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,199
mobile phone on the

511
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,240
on the scooter so um you have a bunch of

512
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,919
lighting here around

513
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,159
also in real life um

514
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,320
and yeah maybe we can just sort of like

515
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,640
walk you quickly through the

516
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,320
technology we developed to sort of

517
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,880
harness the

518
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,320
the free energy available on these

519
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,679
devices

520
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:36,879
which again is uh it's a feature

521
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:40,960
it's not a bug

522
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:44,880
so if we start

523
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:49,039
here i'm sitting right on top

524
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:53,039
of a microcontroller with wi-fi

525
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:56,240
um esp12f

526
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:59,440
that creates a wireless hotspot

527
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,480
and runs a web server that contains the

528
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,720
the artworks so

529
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,000
anyone could connect to it with a mobile

530
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,120
phone or

531
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,480
a laptop and they will get a little

532
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,479
pop-up

533
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,559
on android it's sometimes a bit more

534
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,320
difficult sometimes not

535
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:21,440
um it will present you the the artwork

536
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,720
that's that's running on it

537
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:28,159
um if we go a bit further down

538
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:32,720
there's a a little black thingy it's a

539
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:35,520
voltage regulator that um because um

540
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,400
that turns the 5 volt from the charging

541
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,840
coil

542
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:43,200
into 3.3 volts for the esp

543
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,760
um if we follow the the green line it's

544
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,679
our

545
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,840
custom pcb we made to sort of snugly

546
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,559
fit all the electronics into the the

547
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:56,639
replica of the of the charging pad

548
00:24:52,559 --> 00:25:00,240
um you'll see a beautiful copper coil

549
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:03,919
with some electronics on it um

550
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:07,200
this is a sort of soldier's diy

551
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:10,159
module to create your own um

552
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,520
like phone charging station or device or

553
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,559
whatever

554
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,600
um it is capable to turn

555
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,200
uh like the qi standard wireless

556
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,080
charging

557
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,720
uh standard uh developed for for mobile

558
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,840
phones

559
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,039
uh which is alternating current

560
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:32,879
um it turns it into a direct current

561
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:35,919
of 5 volts um that can be in turn

562
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,039
used by the esp after it's been

563
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:42,960
shifted to 3.3 volts

564
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:45,440
um yeah i mean let's say that this

565
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,840
um we use the different versions of this

566
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:51,200
car in in the process and

567
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,120
um originally this like board set up

568
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,640
here or like just the coil and the

569
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,520
and the small board attached to it is

570
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,039
we found these were boards that were

571
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,000
created to

572
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,679
give this wireless qi capability to

573
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,760
devices that

574
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:12,960
didn't have that before so

575
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,039
basically make everything qi

576
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,039
capable which is the standard that these

577
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,559
charging pads were using so

578
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:24,400
we just took one of these uh to

579
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:28,080
charge our or just power our gallery

580
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:30,880
chip yeah there are also

581
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,199
other models that are sort of adapters

582
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,679
for

583
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,480
older phones so you can turn your old

584
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,880
phone into

585
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,480
a wireless chargeable phone

586
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,919
some of these they require some

587
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,600
modifications

588
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,600
which we will later share as well

589
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:53,200
yeah maybe one fun thing to notice

590
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,960
is that yeah there's no

591
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,960
way to connect to this thing uh

592
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,080
physically um

593
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,960
so yeah one of the limitations of uh two

594
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,399
megabytes

595
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,600
uh comes from the fact that um we can

596
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,640
update these microcontrollers

597
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:14,000
over the air so we can update the

598
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:17,520
firmware running on it using a wi-fi

599
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,039
and yeah we actually did not password

600
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,840
protect this

601
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,520
uh left it intentionally open in like

602
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,720
the hope that someone would

603
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,440
find a scooter on the streets um find

604
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,559
this

605
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,399
this strange module and then um yeah

606
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:36,000
would be able to like repurpose it for

607
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,000
its own uh for his own goals

608
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:44,639
one of the sort of goals was to

609
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:48,559
to make it sort of easy to apply

610
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,799
easy to remove and non-destructible

611
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,840
and i think maybe the the the most

612
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,240
important thing or

613
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,240
the most

614
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,840
um is not hampered by this uh or

615
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,159
obstructed by this adult

616
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,158
so you can still charge your phone

617
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,000
if you put it on the pad so

618
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,639
here you see a little slideshow of how

619
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,240
to mount

620
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:17,440
our replica parasite

621
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,799
so it easily slides on the existing um

622
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,840
charging pad uh i would say the only

623
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,360
difference is

624
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,879
um the rubber anti-slip

625
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:32,959
rings um of course

626
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:36,720
our sort of yeah hand-painted

627
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,039
stencil with the logo yeah but basically

628
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,919
the purpose of this was just to

629
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,919
create this

630
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:49,120
mostly invisible add-on that

631
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:53,200
uh um might then be

632
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:55,918
like well will not be found by

633
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,520
um someone um who's not looking for it

634
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,600
by accident and then be

635
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,840
like removed immediately we wanted it to

636
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,199
be like very stealthy

637
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,240
um for for it to last longer i guess

638
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,640
and uh these like shells that we

639
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:14,080
vacuum molded they like fit snugly onto

640
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,440
the original board and they just snap on

641
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,879
the plastic protects the chips inside

642
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,679
from the

643
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,640
from from the weather and then yeah once

644
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,000
they're mounted

645
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,120
the asp gets powered by the scooter

646
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,960
and the wi-fi becomes available and you

647
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,760
can just

648
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,080
as soon as you're in range you can see

649
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,000
the

650
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,240
network on your phone you can connect to

651
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,159
it and a pop-up portal will

652
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,159
show the artwork that is on there

653
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,600
yeah so you have to be like that close

654
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:55,439
to the actual scooter to

655
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:58,399
view the artwork through the artwork

656
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,840
no yeah and basically after we've

657
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:04,158
created this um

658
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:07,600
thing we um then uh

659
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:10,000
we we mounted it uh onto a bunch of

660
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,959
these scooters that we found to be

661
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,039
charging

662
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,640
uh even though they weren't rented so

663
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,440
giving out free

664
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,960
power all the time we mounted them uh

665
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,000
those modules to

666
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,120
to them and then yeah as we said earlier

667
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,799
after our little

668
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,199
um um opening uh

669
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,879
we just put them out on the streets and

670
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,640
um

671
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,799
we're hoping that they were traveling

672
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,520
that they will be traveling through the

673
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:44,639
micro mobility service area on their

674
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:48,240
on themselves um and

675
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:51,360
see we um freed the scooters all

676
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,440
within the area of nanoikon in berlin

677
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,719
and you can see uh some of them

678
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,799
basically stayed in

679
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,399
noikon for the whole duration of the

680
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,279
show others moved

681
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,158
quite far like to bedding and

682
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:06,159
charlottenburg

683
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:08,960
and stuff um but yeah we were very

684
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,919
curious and and and and we looked very

685
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,200
closely

686
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:16,080
um into that data and

687
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,039
you can see after maybe two or three

688
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,240
days

689
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,720
uh one of the scooters made a like huge

690
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,080
trip

691
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,679
to like spandau which is actually

692
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,120
outside of the normal service area of

693
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,120
this

694
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,479
of these scooters and we were super

695
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,799
curious um

696
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,519
at first we thought oh this is some

697
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,639
drunk

698
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:41,440
driver who over the night took a scooter

699
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,440
on a road trip for four hours and ran

700
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,120
until the battery died

701
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,200
and we were very um worried about our

702
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,959
module and we wanted to see

703
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,360
as we said in the first couple of days

704
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,559
we were super worried about them and we

705
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,519
immediately

706
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:02,639
um decided to like step on our bikes and

707
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:05,120
bike there to um see

708
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,640
what was wrong with uh or if there was

709
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,000
anything wrong with the scooter how it

710
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,960
ended up there

711
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,840
and yeah that's how we arrived here yeah

712
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,200
that's how

713
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:18,399
we arrived here this

714
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,919
place here is the backyard

715
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:25,120
of a tier service facility so

716
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,720
it imminently became clear to us that

717
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,120
it wasn't a drunk driving we drove it

718
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,760
here it was actually one of the service

719
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,959
technicians

720
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:36,080
um that was on the regular basis

721
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,480
services servicing these scooters and we

722
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,120
had

723
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,880
noticed the scooter status changed to

724
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,199
like damage or something so

725
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,120
we couldn't get to the scooter and

726
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,840
remove our module before

727
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,918
it was taken here so yeah we just

728
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,279
followed the api

729
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,279
here to this location

730
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,760
and yeah so

731
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,360
we found that over the course of this

732
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,799
week um

733
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:08,399
maybe three scooters ended up here um

734
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:11,440
and uh as we said they

735
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,239
they as we found out um there were a

736
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,480
couple of

737
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,559
uh workers driving around on these

738
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,399
mopeds that you see here in the back

739
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,760
um they were moving in and out of the

740
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,879
warehouse and we

741
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,279
um quickly engaged with um with the

742
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,799
workers there and yeah we actually

743
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:30,240
um like as we said we we previously

744
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:34,080
found this

745
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,880
this uh bug of sorts we never found out

746
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,439
whether

747
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,799
uh the the possibility to charge a phone

748
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,000
even without

749
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,879
renting the scooter is a bug or if it's

750
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,240
a feature we

751
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,679
realize there's a specific number or a

752
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,720
specific version of the

753
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,279
scooters that are available for this

754
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,120
we realized okay there's the those

755
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,440
scooters that start with the two set

756
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,080
their

757
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,600
their id's will start with the 2 7 or

758
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,080
sometimes a 2 8

759
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,918
and they will all have a helmet box as

760
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,559
we saw in the first picture they all

761
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,839
have this

762
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:12,879
like black box on their um steering

763
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,960
um and uh we

764
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,239
searched the api for these specific

765
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,879
models and then

766
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,598
tracked them through the through the api

767
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,799
and

768
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:26,000
well it led us here to this um very

769
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,919
real back door into um

770
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:33,280
the workshop and uh yeah

771
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,000
just this this new world of or this new

772
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,280
layer of

773
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,879
the this these these companies became

774
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,919
very um very visible to us and obviously

775
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:47,040
um all we cared about was our scooter

776
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,480
we wanted to see if it's still alive if

777
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,440
it's still

778
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,760
sending a signal so why don't you follow

779
00:34:51,440 --> 00:35:02,880
us

780
00:34:51,760 --> 00:35:06,960
into the warehouse ta-da

781
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:10,000
here we are um this is uh what we found

782
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:13,440
when we entered the stream yeah

783
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,320
all these scooters uh basically

784
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,280
yeah all of these scooters were in need

785
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,280
for repair

786
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,560
and there were a bunch of technicians

787
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,880
working on them

788
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,839
as we said we we talked to one of them

789
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,760
and he was very

790
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:28,320
friendly um to let us take a peek inside

791
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,520
and

792
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,040
take a look at yeah how these screws

793
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,240
were serviced

794
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,480
and yeah a lot of realizations came from

795
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,479
that

796
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,400
yeah so speedy well what what actually

797
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,280
happened to the parasite

798
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,160
yeah but you still see it yeah we

799
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,880
immediately

800
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,279
uh yeah we immediately took out uh the

801
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,079
phone

802
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,040
and we searched for the wi-fi signal and

803
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,000
uh

804
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,160
well play grave 2020 the work by sarah

805
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,079
gand it was still there it was though

806
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,399
the wi-fi signal was really strong we

807
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,720
were super like stoked about it but

808
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,480
looking at all the scooters and i mean

809
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,439
some of them are

810
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,160
completely taken apart we were sure that

811
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,200
um

812
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,879
this this parasite of ours will

813
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:23,200
eventually get uh well found and

814
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:26,320
and then be destroyed um so

815
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,680
we were we weren't able to locate it

816
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:32,000
inside the area um we were also

817
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,960
thrown out shortly after taking this

818
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,119
picture

819
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,520
because apparently you are not allowed

820
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:41,839
to take pictures in

821
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,839
this facility

822
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:50,480
so yeah there was a interesting

823
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:53,440
layer indeed on top of just

824
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,119
you know chasing scooters on the streets

825
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,720
and looking at maps

826
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:02,320
um this displayed

827
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:05,439
a whole nother level of physicality

828
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:08,240
to us and

829
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,160
made us realize actually um what we had

830
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,839
become

831
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,399
so over the yeah the short short while

832
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,759
uh

833
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,000
during the the one week of the

834
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,400
exhibition um

835
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,480
we actually realized that we we sort of

836
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,440
became an ad hoc

837
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,880
sharing company ourselves we found

838
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,240
ourselves

839
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,200
running around berlin trying to

840
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,118
you know see how our modules were doing

841
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,000
also to see if the scooters were still

842
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,200
okay

843
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,760
um yeah certainly because yeah

844
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,319
if they were falling over they yeah we

845
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,320
had to put them up again so people would

846
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,560
rent them and they would get charged

847
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,560
again so our module we had to take care

848
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,078
of our gallery hosts

849
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,680
exactly um so i don't know if that's a

850
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,280
symbiotic relationship

851
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:02,160
we were in but um and of course

852
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,160
yeah we we also used the api in the same

853
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,160
way the company does

854
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,520
to track to track your to track our

855
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,440
modules

856
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:14,560
um so um

857
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:18,240
this place here also

858
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,880
yeah it it it just blew our minds

859
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,759
basically

860
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,760
um that you can use this publicly

861
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,960
available

862
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,359
map data basically to

863
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,440
find out where these scooters are going

864
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:34,240
and we were actually surprised to see

865
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:38,079
that they are actually being repaired

866
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:41,118
and not just you know recycled

867
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,079
um as you see they're actually like

868
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,079
sorted

869
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:48,320
by different levels of damage uh

870
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,200
here down on the floor there are some

871
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,040
that are

872
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,799
where the steering wheel column is like

873
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,599
completely broken off

874
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,200
um yeah these will be repaired or

875
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,720
decommissioned

876
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:03,520
um we actually decompiled

877
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,480
the application used by the people who

878
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,280
work here

879
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,400
it can be just found in the app store

880
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,560
yeah for each

881
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,520
each micro mobility service they

882
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,720
basically

883
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,680
um have an app that is publicly

884
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,640
available

885
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,399
that all the users will use to track

886
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,640
their scooters and then there's also

887
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,640
an app for all of these service

888
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,440
technicians all of the people who

889
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,480
um go on nightly trips to replace

890
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,839
batteries and

891
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:35,680
yeah we'll do what we did for a week uh

892
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:38,400
check on check on the scooters and um in

893
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,118
a way yeah if they need repairing they

894
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,640
will end up

895
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:45,920
in this place and they all have this

896
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,759
this app for for tiers uh it's they're

897
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,320
called rangers the people who

898
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,320
collect them and switch up batteries and

899
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,480
there's a shelter app which

900
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,079
is probably used by the people here

901
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,560
inside this warehouse because

902
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,119
while decompiling it we found all these

903
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,200
new

904
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,800
statuses that these scooters can be in

905
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,078
where they would have

906
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,760
very specific um information about the

907
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,920
sort of damage that was done to the

908
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,480
scooter whether the gps that you

909
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,920
issue that broadly here are or just a

910
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,200
damaged blinker or

911
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,319
steering wheel or something

912
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:25,839
all of that was sort of like within um

913
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:25,839
the api that we found

914
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,560
yeah so um speedy how

915
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,359
how many of the of the parasites did we

916
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,640
actually

917
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:39,680
end up losing yeah that is

918
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,960
a very interesting because we

919
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,520
um as we said we we found this place and

920
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,839
we

921
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,680
uh got thrown out of it immediately and

922
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:50,720
we were

923
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:54,160
sure to never see our module again

924
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,598
and for this specific module um it

925
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,279
actually took quite a while

926
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,800
like we talked to one of the service

927
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,440
technicians he said

928
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,800
usually scooters can be in and out of

929
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,599
here within days

930
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,160
for our scooter it took almost two

931
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,599
months

932
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:12,160
um to be back on the street

933
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,599
uh as soon as we realized they that the

934
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,000
scooter is back on the street

935
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,119
actually we lost uh during this week we

936
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,480
lost in total

937
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,040
three modules to this place and all

938
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,880
three

939
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,880
eventually came back on the street so

940
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,960
that's a a good thing they

941
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,839
actually all three um were able uh

942
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,000
were able to get repaired and yeah we

943
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:37,279
did what we did we tracked them down and

944
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,480
we looked at them and we were extremely

945
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,280
surprised

946
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,920
to see that our modules were still on

947
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,920
there

948
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,200
they were still working fine they were

949
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,280
in perfect shape

950
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,560
the scooters were repaired and the

951
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,560
galleries were back online

952
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,480
yeah so a possible explanation for this

953
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:00,879
um

954
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:03,760
we basically don't know um

955
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,160
i we can't believe that that our our

956
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,440
like

957
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,078
um add-on is so um our replica is so

958
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,599
well done

959
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,839
that uh person who works with them daily

960
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,640
uh wouldn't notice in in a blink of an

961
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,279
eye

962
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,319
uh when we would you know walk in berlin

963
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,240
on the streets

964
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:25,359
we would just spot our our models

965
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,200
instantaneously from across the street

966
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:29,440
without even checking your wi-fi or the

967
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,439
map

968
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,879
but yeah another explanation could be

969
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,359
that um

970
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,319
these scooters are actually uh uh

971
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:40,480
evolving

972
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:42,240
and uh also migrating so

973
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,319
yeah as you might have noticed if you

974
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,319
live in a city where these uh

975
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,920
e-scooters are driving around like

976
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:50,240
almost every

977
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,839
yeah three months there's there's a new

978
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,078
model going around

979
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,599
um either because other ones are being

980
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,640
decommissioned or

981
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:02,000
or whatever and maybe

982
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:05,118
yeah our module was yeah

983
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,520
seen as just a new another prototype or

984
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,839
a new model roaming the streets

985
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,880
um yeah i mean these these people who

986
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,359
work there

987
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,560
they didn't seem to be um actually

988
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,319
working

989
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,799
actual employees of tier they seemed

990
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:22,400
this this warehouse it seemed to be

991
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,359
there before even tier like it seemed to

992
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,839
be this

993
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:27,440
workshop that was there prior to the

994
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:30,720
micro mobility

995
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,960
industry um popping up in berlin and

996
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,680
basically it seemed to us it seemed as

997
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,640
if this space was just rented out

998
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,480
and these workers were just told to from

999
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,400
now on repair these

1000
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:47,760
and yeah as as scooty already said like

1001
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,400
within the time frame we were closely

1002
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,359
engaged with these scooters we we've

1003
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,160
seen probably

1004
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:55,440
three different models um pop on the

1005
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,560
street so it's

1006
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,359
it's not super unlikely that the workers

1007
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,680
there they just

1008
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,680
thought this they were meant to look

1009
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,200
like this

1010
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,200
another funny coincidence

1011
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,480
one day we found one scooter had uh

1012
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,720
migrated to

1013
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,960
uh marseille in france uh possibly

1014
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,439
to look for better weather because uh

1015
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,880
winter in berlin is of course

1016
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,880
very cold and dark

1017
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:29,440
but then we noticed that it was

1018
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:30,720
next to a word which is uh like a german

1019
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,720
engineering

1020
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:38,640
company an equipment rental

1021
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:42,959
um when we uh actually visited

1022
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:46,560
this this space uh in berlin um

1023
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:50,560
we couldn't help notice that the map um

1024
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,920
showed a word next door as well so

1025
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,880
there's a there's an interesting

1026
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,440
connection there or maybe not

1027
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,520
maybe it's just coincidence but two of

1028
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,240
the scooters that were taken from us one

1029
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,640
to merced

1030
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,240
one to here they both ended up very

1031
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,359
close to a good store

1032
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,879
so i don't know if there's a connection

1033
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:12,319
between those two

1034
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,720
and also the scooter that was migrated

1035
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,960
to marseille it was an older version it

1036
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:20,078
was an older model and we quickly

1037
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,200
realized that um it seems in berlin

1038
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:25,119
specifically

1039
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:28,240
because tier the company that

1040
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,599
owns all of these scooters um it's a

1041
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,640
berlin-based company

1042
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:33,760
and it seems that within berlin they try

1043
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,879
to only

1044
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:40,319
operate with the latest models

1045
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:43,359
and all the models will be

1046
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:45,520
either decommissioned or migrated to

1047
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:48,560
other locations where

1048
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:51,440
maybe their presence is not as prominent

1049
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,440
as in berlin

1050
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,119
yeah so to sort of

1051
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:08,399
wrap up our sort of approach in this um

1052
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:11,279
um it was sort of a way to to

1053
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,560
to get to know these companies and and

1054
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,040
these devices and

1055
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,560
and sort of try to figure out what it

1056
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,240
what they are

1057
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:23,520
um we sort of used

1058
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:25,118
um like like the tactic of art or the

1059
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,079
excuse of art i would say

1060
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:30,160
um as a way to to to deal with these uh

1061
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:33,520
invading species

1062
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:37,200
um but yeah that's of course only uh

1063
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:40,720
uh yeah one way to to to deal with this

1064
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:44,240
uh we already mentioned people um yeah

1065
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:46,640
um responding in ways that are um

1066
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,560
destructive and and maybe not so

1067
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:52,319
environmentally friendly

1068
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:54,640
um because these uh devices um

1069
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:56,880
although claimed by by all the companies

1070
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,200
to be like co2 neutral

1071
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,240
uh of course still contain like 20

1072
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,279
kilograms of

1073
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:05,919
lithium iron batteries and yeah if you

1074
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,880
look around here

1075
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,000
how many how much material there's like

1076
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,480
seriously

1077
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,839
on the streets and being put into this

1078
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,640
especially considering

1079
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:17,759
um the the new models every couple of

1080
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,000
months

1081
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,880
wow this thing is just so fast and

1082
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,680
evolving so

1083
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,160
fast and i guess we we can all remember

1084
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,879
the

1085
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:28,480
the pictures from china and their bike

1086
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,839
graveyards because

1087
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:35,200
previous to this version of

1088
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:37,759
douglas sharing uh micro mobility

1089
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,960
we had the rental bikes we had all these

1090
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,720
different companies

1091
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,119
in berlin dumping their bikes in the

1092
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,598
streets in a very similar way to

1093
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,480
where to like how we came upon these

1094
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,440
beautiful

1095
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,800
creatures and they all disappeared i

1096
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,880
mean in berlin you can

1097
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,760
eventually spot a broken mobike on a few

1098
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,000
corners

1099
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,720
but the app disappeared from the app

1100
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:04,480
store and basically

1101
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,480
they just disappeared and

1102
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:11,599
they ended up on graveyards

1103
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:15,040
uh in china

1104
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:17,839
and uh yeah para city or we call

1105
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,160
this add-on para city gallery this was

1106
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:21,680
just

1107
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,640
sort of our way to interact with the

1108
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,319
scooters and then

1109
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:30,000
see if like they will run into a say

1110
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:34,079
in the into a similar faith maybe

1111
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,359
yeah so yeah in our sort of research or

1112
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:41,040
our journey um we

1113
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:44,160
we mainly used uh like looked at the api

1114
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,880
um and sort of reverse engineered some

1115
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,680
apps to

1116
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:50,640
to gain some more knowledge about this

1117
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,640
whole ecosystem

1118
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:56,640
but of course you can also look at the

1119
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,040
economic models of these companies you

1120
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,879
can

1121
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:04,319
go to crunchbase website and and see who

1122
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,920
invest in what and and who buys who

1123
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:08,079
um you can follow me there is a

1124
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,400
connection between word and tier in the

1125
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,240
end

1126
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,240
maybe you will find that on crunch base

1127
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:17,920
and of course there's a very uh

1128
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:19,440
language of marketing that's being

1129
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:23,680
deployed by these companies

1130
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:27,440
and very interesting terms of services

1131
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:32,078
and privacy statements where you

1132
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:32,079
will actually easily discover that

1133
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,078
yeah most of the the eco-friendliness is

1134
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,760
is

1135
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:42,559
mostly outsourced to to third parties um

1136
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:45,760
for example the recycling of tears is

1137
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:49,400
done by deutsche recycling

1138
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:51,200
their co2 goals are offset by

1139
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:54,319
climatepartner.com

1140
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:57,520
and yeah as speedy mentioned this

1141
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:59,440
this whole space here is it's it's also

1142
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,440
not owned by it here it's it's

1143
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,960
another contractor on a contractor on a

1144
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,800
contractor creating

1145
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,800
um yeah um a lot of small small jobs

1146
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,200
uh in this blockchain it's basically

1147
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:15,200
already laid out to be a very

1148
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:16,799
momentarily it seems that all of this is

1149
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,319
very

1150
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:22,800
yeah just uh during the

1151
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:23,520
the pandemic you would see within weeks

1152
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,760
uh

1153
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,800
whole hospital hospitals will be created

1154
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,599
and this

1155
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,280
sort of uh seems a lot like this this is

1156
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:35,119
just a pop-up hospital

1157
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,160
for scooters and um it'll exist as long

1158
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,960
as scooters exist

1159
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:40,078
and as soon as they're like they have

1160
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,920
evolved to the next

1161
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:48,559
version of the micro mobility

1162
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,559
this will be something else again

1163
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:57,920
exactly another thing you can do is uh

1164
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:59,680
for example yeah um if you do want to do

1165
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,280
some non-destructive

1166
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:06,839
um armchair reverse engineering you can

1167
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:09,920
go to the fcc database

1168
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:13,200
ssc.io and um

1169
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:16,400
yeah look try to see if if um

1170
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:19,040
the electronics are registered there and

1171
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:22,400
mostly you can find pictures of the

1172
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,400
actual electronics that are

1173
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:30,400
inside of these uh equipment

1174
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:34,319
um yeah so the fcc is the the american

1175
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:37,920
sort of um radio watchdog

1176
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:41,520
taking care of the spectrum emissions

1177
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:45,200
and there's also there's also the

1178
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:48,400
way to do something similar to

1179
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:50,879
what we did um decompiling

1180
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,680
all of the available apps to find a

1181
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,720
little

1182
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,680
new entry points as we said the the api

1183
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,319
key that we

1184
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,279
um used was previously discovered by

1185
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:02,160
someone who did

1186
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,000
just the same he decompiled the trap and

1187
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,200
he found this api key just hard

1188
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,640
coded in there and we found out that

1189
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,680
there are different

1190
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,960
types of api keys out there there are

1191
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,240
the ones that

1192
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:18,640
the users will use so if you're on an

1193
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,319
app on official tier app you'll use a

1194
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,240
different api key than

1195
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:24,640
the one that we are using because for

1196
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,520
example on the tier app you'll be able

1197
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,520
to

1198
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:31,759
bring a scooter and like have them blink

1199
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,599
in the street to be more easily located

1200
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:36,640
that's for example something

1201
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:38,880
that we couldn't do with our key um and

1202
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,680
there is more to be discovered

1203
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,480
in within these apps and also as we said

1204
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,960
the

1205
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,160
the other apps that exist from from

1206
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,680
these sharing

1207
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:52,720
companies another entry point is the

1208
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:54,879
the physical scooter itself

1209
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,000
yeah you can notice that on the bottom

1210
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,520
there's often

1211
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:02,640
a large amount of stickers

1212
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:04,800
a lot of times it contains the fcc id

1213
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,839
where you can look up the electronics

1214
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,079
inside

1215
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:09,520
but also like the the original

1216
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,880
manufacturer of these

1217
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:16,000
things which are mostly i believe come

1218
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,520
to come from china and um

1219
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,640
yeah if you know like okay the

1220
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,640
manufacturing way

1221
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,720
if you know the manufacturer and the

1222
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,839
model uh you can look for

1223
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:30,879
like uh service manuals or

1224
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:31,520
manuals in general and get to know some

1225
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,880
of the

1226
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:38,000
more features of these devices

1227
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:40,240
for example on the models of scooters

1228
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,680
you can see here

1229
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,640
there's a little um black bar uh at the

1230
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,839
front

1231
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:51,200
um on the top of it there's a

1232
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:54,240
there's a sort of eye with the led in it

1233
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:57,118
um but some of the the

1234
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,319
um i have to say some of the manuals

1235
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:01,440
actually

1236
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:04,400
um provide a little indication of an

1237
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,920
optional camera to be built in so maybe

1238
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,119
that's the next step of the

1239
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:11,839
evolution um that these

1240
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,960
sort of scooters can uh you know observe

1241
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:15,599
themselves and their

1242
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,599
environments

1243
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:24,960
um yeah so these were the ways we we

1244
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:28,319
thought of like approaching this um

1245
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:31,599
and we sort of now want to ask you like

1246
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:35,119
um or offer you a little hand in

1247
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:38,319
how you could possibly approach this

1248
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:42,000
um yeah earlier this year we

1249
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:45,279
did a workshop um around this

1250
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,319
topic um in because

1251
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:53,359
in stuttgart and we um

1252
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:56,240
basically we had already uh come up with

1253
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:57,839
this concept of ours this concept of the

1254
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:00,558
roaming speed show

1255
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:01,599
and well we were sure that this single

1256
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:03,760
air this

1257
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,359
single entry point of the charging pad

1258
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,400
this this option

1259
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:12,000
for free um electricity

1260
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,440
um it could be like our our way of using

1261
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,680
it is just the

1262
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:19,760
one little like possibility that

1263
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,879
is out there and we were doing this

1264
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,000
workshop we

1265
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:26,160
actually um had a couple of

1266
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,640
wooden adapters made that would also

1267
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:32,160
snugly fit into the

1268
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:35,839
into the smartphone

1269
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:39,440
holder with the g coil and

1270
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:43,040
it would allow the participants of our

1271
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:47,040
workshop to create their own add-ons to

1272
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:50,240
to see for possibilities

1273
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:54,400
for themselves to sort of

1274
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,399
um increase the

1275
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:58,000
the value of these scooters to them

1276
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,400
personally

1277
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,720
because we found that a lot of people

1278
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,440
were criticizing these scooters simply

1279
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,200
because

1280
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:10,160
the solution that they that the the

1281
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,640
micro mobility industry um said that

1282
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,359
they were

1283
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,720
they were this this beautiful climate

1284
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:18,558
neutral solution to

1285
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:22,160
a mobility problem that

1286
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:25,359
existed in in urban areas

1287
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:28,240
we found that this solution this

1288
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:29,440
scooter solution to a lot of them

1289
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,839
doesn't

1290
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,359
exist it's it's it's useless these

1291
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:35,279
scooters are useless they are not

1292
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:37,680
solving this

1293
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,359
this problem for a large part of the

1294
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,359
people and we were just thinking

1295
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:43,598
okay so if these scooters are here to

1296
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:44,000
stay and what is the only good thing

1297
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,079
that they

1298
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,200
can offer well it's a large

1299
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,280
infrastructure

1300
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,640
and it's free energy for some of them at

1301
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,280
least and

1302
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,920
we invited participants of our workshop

1303
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,640
to

1304
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,040
um just think of more ways other than

1305
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,558
the

1306
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:04,319
gallery at all think of more ways to um

1307
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:07,520
engage with the scooter and increase

1308
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:13,839
well usability or just

1309
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:13,839
value of these scooters

1310
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:22,319
pcb is that we created for the

1311
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,359
um for the gallery is just put inside

1312
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:27,119
the wooden block

1313
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:27,598
and um instead of powering this wifi

1314
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:30,240
chip

1315
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,520
you could just use the power to power

1316
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,720
whichever other

1317
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:38,000
um um device you want

1318
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,720
um in this case a toothbrush for i don't

1319
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,760
know

1320
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:46,879
free charging up two toothbrushes

1321
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,880
on the street forever that is

1322
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:53,279
a thing a theme

1323
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,760
it's the new thing i heard it's the new

1324
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,920
thing

1325
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,920
i heard i heard too

1326
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:03,839
yeah so um in the end here we basically

1327
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,960
want to

1328
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:09,119
take the same approach we want to invite

1329
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,920
everybody um

1330
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,640
to maybe think of uh solutions

1331
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,640
themselves

1332
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:18,558
maybe think of um a way of communicating

1333
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:21,520
with the scooters themselves

1334
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:23,520
to just get a better understanding of

1335
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:26,799
the industry

1336
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:27,280
of the way the industry works and the

1337
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:30,799
way

1338
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:34,000
we can actually benefit we

1339
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:37,440
as the general public because obviously

1340
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:40,480
a lot of the stuff from these scooters

1341
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:43,760
is is actually not for the public or

1342
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:46,799
at least not for the general public

1343
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,119
and um we invite you to actually think

1344
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:50,400
of

1345
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:53,440
um hacks uh

1346
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,960
add-ons modifications word um

1347
00:58:53,440 --> 00:59:00,079
that um that will for you

1348
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:03,359
solve this uh self solve a

1349
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:06,400
problem um we have created this

1350
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:09,839
github where we share

1351
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:12,640
um a couple of nice goodies

1352
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:12,640
with you guys

1353
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:20,960
yeah so we're actually intentionally

1354
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:23,200
not sharing um our

1355
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,720
sort of original wi-fi uh modules

1356
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,359
schematics and code

1357
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,480
because we think that can be found in

1358
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,880
berlin still

1359
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,240
we share all of the information on the

1360
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:35,680
gallery

1361
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:39,118
add-on if you actually go to berlin find

1362
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:42,720
our scooter that we um provided

1363
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:44,480
in the open coil show and

1364
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,319
yeah you can log on to the wi-fi and

1365
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:49,520
download all the schematics there

1366
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:49,520
but this is something different

1367
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:54,640
yeah the url for that you can actually

1368
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:58,240
find on on github

1369
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:01,839
on the at the url you see above and

1370
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,839
now our server will die

1371
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:09,920
yeah hopefully not um

1372
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,240
yeah so on the on the github you'll find

1373
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,319
like

1374
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:17,839
plans um how to modify

1375
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:21,440
like cheap cheap adapters to work

1376
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:24,640
with these cheat coils you will find a

1377
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,440
positive mold for vacuum forming your

1378
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,960
own

1379
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:31,920
adapter that's 3d printable

1380
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,319
and you will find the the wooden block

1381
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,359
that's

1382
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:38,640
uh either laser cuttable or

1383
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:39,680
cc-able um yeah this is really nice

1384
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,680
because there's

1385
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,118
holes and you can just you know use a

1386
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:45,520
hammer and

1387
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:47,760
and some nails to to to mount whatever

1388
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:52,559
you want on this

1389
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:56,720
um yeah maybe to to sort of wrap up

1390
01:00:52,559 --> 01:01:00,000
this kind of technical talk

1391
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:03,439
in some ways um this is of

1392
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,720
of course not a purely purely technical

1393
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,920
project by

1394
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:11,200
uh to brilliant artists

1395
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:13,359
um this this project is is you know

1396
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:18,640
running for half a year now

1397
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:22,160
um it's uh it's like an accumulation of

1398
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:25,118
social contacts and trends and um

1399
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,598
spaces but also knowledge that has has

1400
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,960
been

1401
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:31,440
um you know um

1402
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,799
be been exchanged over over at least 10

1403
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,920
years time

1404
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:39,599
um so it's it's actually a very very

1405
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:41,760
big social part in this project um

1406
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,200
yeah and in the same way i think we

1407
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:46,640
believe that

1408
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,200
um also just dropping technology on the

1409
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,319
streets

1410
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:53,919
isn't gonna solve like uh social issues

1411
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:56,558
or in fair environmental issues um

1412
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,359
and yeah we want to sort of connect with

1413
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,079
you and

1414
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:01,279
try to think of yeah try to think of

1415
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:04,480
other ways to do this

1416
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:07,200
to actually um yeah

1417
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,559
make something make a difference in in

1418
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:11,200
this industry

1419
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:11,599
um because i think um there are enough

1420
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,000
um

1421
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:15,119
possibilities enough entry points enough

1422
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,920
front doors

1423
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,200
really um to to engage with the scooters

1424
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,559
to like find out

1425
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:26,799
stuff about them yeah and

1426
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:28,480
and to sum this up yeah we just want to

1427
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:30,240
give uh in the end we want to give a

1428
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,880

1456
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:48,319
a let's go to q a go to get up

1457
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:49,759
download our stuff hack some scooters

1458
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:52,720
find

1459
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,720
solutions to problems that's so nice of

1460
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:58,319
you thank you so much

1461
01:03:54,720 --> 01:04:01,919
it's been a real yeah totally new

1462
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:04,640
perspective on on these uh strange

1463
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,839
little things that's crowding all the

1464
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:09,200
streets everywhere

1465
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:11,920
even if i already fought um what about

1466
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:13,839
cars the cars need much more space maybe

1467
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:16,079
that's another idea

1468
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:18,640
yeah and they're just much more

1469
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:22,000
difficult to hack we found

1470
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:25,680
and yeah maybe maybe we should have

1471
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,079
an outside tag but i just wanted to say

1472
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,078
um

1473
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:30,319
we're very sorry we had some problems

1474
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:33,520
with the with the audio

1475
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:37,200
um in between it wasn't too much but

1476
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:40,240
um still very very sorry for that

1477
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:42,960
and um unfortunately we can also not

1478
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:45,520
um guarantee that it's gonna be better

1479
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:48,559
on the media cccde

1480
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:49,119
but it was still okay um you know in

1481
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:52,640
germany

1482
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:55,039
it's all still newland so

1483
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,879
maybe maybe we just need to be a little

1484
01:04:55,039 --> 01:05:01,839
bit patient

1485
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:04,720
um let me just uh jump in here and um

1486
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:05,200
repeat once more uh the github address

1487
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:09,759
that's

1488
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:12,960
github.com slash speedy minus scooty

1489
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:16,319
slash open coil

1490
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,799
and while we're at it we're very happy

1491
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:20,160
if you

1492
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:23,280
would also give feedback for the um

1493
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:27,680
for the talks you can do that in the uh

1494
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:31,359
far plan um not in the blinky fancy app

1495
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:34,720
um uh in the normal

1496
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:37,598
far plan and there's a feedback link and

1497
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,558
you can tell us what's been good what

1498
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:41,359
hasn't been good

1499
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,640
um of course we know there's sometimes

1500
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:44,960
technical problems but

1501
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,799
i already heard that the target show

1502
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,000
which is our biggest news show on

1503
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:51,759
germany

1504
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:55,359
public television they even had to

1505
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:57,280
stop their show today because of

1506
01:05:55,359 --> 01:06:00,720
problems so we're not the only ones

1507
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:04,079
we're not alone and

1508
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:07,520
yeah we have

1509
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:09,119
a lot of questions and finally we also

1510
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:12,640
have a lot of time

1511
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:15,680
so um i hope

1512
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:17,920
that we're ready now to maybe switch

1513
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:20,240
to these questions let me just check

1514
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,240
that

1515
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,400
okay

1516
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:33,038
so first one about

1517
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,000
maybe they clustered for for different

1518
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:35,599
topics

1519
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,520
maybe you want to choose a topic first

1520
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:41,039
um about the project in general

1521
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:42,319
about the implant um about the api about

1522
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,839
the hardware about

1523
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:46,400
off topic what what are you going to

1524
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:49,440
start with off topic

1525
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:52,799
off topic honestly sure

1526
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:53,359
of course are you aware of any backup

1527
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:56,880
doors

1528
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:56,880
back doors with these scooters

1529
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,399
not really i mean we're not even sure

1530
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,440
that

1531
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:06,960
what we have found is actually a bug we

1532
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:11,039
we've just found this open coil

1533
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:12,640
um that gives out free energy and

1534
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,960
we're not sure if that's a bug or a

1535
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:16,799
feature actually so

1536
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,720
i mean yeah it's it's a feature in a way

1537
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:20,720
that um yeah

1538
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:23,680
you're like allowed to charge your phone

1539
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:26,959
um when you rent it

1540
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:28,078
so yeah yeah maybe there's someone in

1541
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:31,520
the audience who can

1542
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:35,760
sort of enlighten us about this

1543
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:40,520
maybe please drop a note on twitter

1544
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:44,799
um with the hashtag rc2

1545
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:44,799
rc32 sorry um

1546
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:51,440
yeah uh or on irc

1547
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:54,319
and next off topic question how did you

1548
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:57,839
do this awesome presentation

1549
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:57,839
i know

1550
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,759
oh green screen

1551
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:10,400
thank you yeah it's been it's been nice

1552
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:13,039
to go outside while not going outside

1553
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:15,039
okay next topic yeah yeah it was like

1554
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:18,480
the only way that we could be together

1555
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:18,960
and yeah yeah true yeah it's it's nice

1556
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:21,919
to see

1557
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,960
yeah i know what you mean uh hardware

1558
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,839
implant api

1559
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,839
or project

1560
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:32,080
you choose oh

1561
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:39,440
api api

1562
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:42,400
is this api still open yes

1563
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:44,559
yes please don't close it we want to do

1564
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:48,238
this show another time another

1565
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,239
place please please don't close it

1566
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:52,000
or you take the next car project

1567
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:54,318
remember

1568
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,120
okay what are the most interesting funny

1569
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:59,440
unusual

1570
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:59,439
things that you have seen with the api

1571
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:07,040
oh that's a very good question

1572
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:10,719
uh there were some some funny

1573
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:15,040
um repair statuses like

1574
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:17,520
uh destroyed or something

1575
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:20,960
yes some were really obviously pointing

1576
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:23,679
towards the commission

1577
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:26,399
highly decommissioned highly highly

1578
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:28,640
decommissionable

1579
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:30,479
yeah yeah just the general stuff that we

1580
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,480
figured out oh okay so

1581
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:33,919
apparently the scooter that was in

1582
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:37,198
berlin two days ago

1583
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,600
is now in marseille this this alone was

1584
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:40,799
a

1585
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:42,560
a weird coincidence and then i don't

1586
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:46,158
know if you've noticed but

1587
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:48,560
um the during the screen recording of

1588
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:51,439
our website you could actually see that

1589
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,560
currently one of the 11 scooters we

1590
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:56,239
chose

1591
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:59,120
to host our add-ons moved all the way to

1592
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:59,440
potsdam which is also definitely outside

1593
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,239
of

1594
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:04,159
service area and as far as we can tell

1595
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,839
there it's not another workshop it's

1596
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:11,440
just a residential area

1597
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:14,560
and um maybe someone uh check it out

1598
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:18,480
yeah maybe okay

1599
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:19,679
total the have you seen any interesting

1600
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,159
moving patterns

1601
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,760
on other than the trip to the repair

1602
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:27,199
facility okay we have that

1603
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,679
i guess um okay maybe we go to implant

1604
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:31,120
now

1605
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:35,040
is that okay or harder sure

1606
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:38,559
okay so uh sorry if it was already said

1607
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,560
how expensive is the implant

1608
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:46,320
if you buy it in bulk it's it's around

1609
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:48,960
five euros i would say okay

1610
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,440
yeah it depends it really depends on on

1611
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,280
like

1612
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:54,000
the scale you want to do this obviously

1613
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:57,120
we bought a bunch of

1614
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,760
uh esps and stuff we because as we

1615
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:01,120
mentioned

1616
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,760
before we we were expecting these things

1617
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:05,120
to launch

1618
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:08,320
to not last as long as they they did and

1619
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:11,599
um we bought a bunch of them so um

1620
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:14,480
we got them for very reasonable but

1621
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:16,320
also we had some ish issues um with

1622
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:19,519
delivery on time

1623
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:23,360
um out of like china obviously

1624
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:26,400
doing due to corona in a way

1625
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:30,000
so we had to last minute switch to uh

1626
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:33,199
to a more local uh supplier and

1627
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:36,239
this supplier like he only had these

1628
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:38,159
these uh these adapters that you would

1629
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:40,480
plug into smartphones all the

1630
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:43,599
smartphones that that don't

1631
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:45,599
have wireless qi capability so we just

1632
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,719
ordered a bunch of these adapters and

1633
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:50,719
then we

1634
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:53,199
like took them apart and just like

1635
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:55,920
we just like took the parts we needed

1636
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:58,000
and they and they didn't work

1637
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,960
yeah at first they didn't work we had to

1638
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,520
like

1639
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:03,199
look at a picture of the the version of

1640
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:05,199
this hardware component that we

1641
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:06,320
previously had and we realized oh just

1642
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:08,080
by comparing

1643
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:10,320
the two pictures we realized oh there

1644
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,040
are like two more components on this

1645
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:13,440
board

1646
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:15,199
and we we just soldered them off and

1647
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:17,599
then bridged uh like two

1648
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:18,320
pins and then they worked again so there

1649
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,080
was a lot of

1650
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:24,480
um weird quirky like uh

1651
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,519
sort of hacks that we had to uh um had

1652
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:29,839
to do just

1653
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:30,640
to um get the get the modules working in

1654
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:34,480
time

1655
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:37,280
and obviously if you're like

1656
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:39,280
if you're on this tight schedule then um

1657
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:42,320
things might get more expensive but

1658
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:43,759
yeah yeah it's already five years versus

1659
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:46,480
money

1660
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,960
um did the technicians find any of your

1661
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,959
implants

1662
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:52,799
yeah as far as we know they didn't

1663
01:12:53,440 --> 01:13:00,480
or maybe they took them to pottstown

1664
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:02,480
uh maybe yeah maybe maybe

1665
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:05,040
maybe we go to harper before we come

1666
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:06,400
back to the project in general

1667
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,159
i think the hardware of some of these

1668
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:11,360
devices is open source do you have an

1669
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:14,559
idea where to find a plan to copy it

1670
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:17,040
um i guess the devices are originally

1671
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,040
attached

1672
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:23,280
i saw i didn't get the last part

1673
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,080
and that's a that's another comment um

1674
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,880
that's uh

1675
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:29,199
belongs to it uh i guess the device is

1676
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,360
originally attached

1677
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:31,360
no

1678
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:37,599
charging the charging pads the charging

1679
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:40,320
pads they are attached to the scooters

1680
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:42,719
they just come with the scooter and as

1681
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,120
we said in our presentation you can try

1682
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:48,239
to

1683
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:48,239
like go through fcc's website or

1684
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:52,400
just look at the serial number and and

1685
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:54,480
fcc

1686
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:56,799
numbers on the scooters themselves to

1687
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:59,440
find out more about the hardware that's

1688
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:01,040
inside these the scooters and inside the

1689
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,919
charging pad that is attached to the

1690
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:05,040
scooter

1691
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:08,000
when it comes to our hardware um

1692
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:09,600
that the the gallery module that we

1693
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,880
attached to the scooters

1694
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:14,640
that um we we haven't we did

1695
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:16,560
made it we did make it publicly

1696
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:19,840
available but only

1697
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:22,800
if you find our scooter in berlin

1698
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:24,800
and log on to its network and download

1699
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:28,239
the contents we will not share it

1700
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:30,320
online ever it's gonna be offline

1701
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:33,280
on a scooter in berlin for as long as

1702
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:33,280
the scooter exists

1703
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:37,519
okay why didn't you just open the

1704
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:43,839
battery pack to get

1705
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:43,840
voltage and place the module there

1706
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:50,400
um this is i don't know

1707
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:52,239
um i think uh these batteries run on 42

1708
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:55,519
volts or something

1709
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:56,400
uh yeah and also we were about to find a

1710
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:59,600
hack that's

1711
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:01,440
non-destructive we we had already seen

1712
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,000
all of this destructive

1713
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:05,839
criticism uh of these scooters we've

1714
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,960
only already seen what

1715
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:11,520
uh how people um in general react

1716
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:13,679
to these when they don't like them and

1717
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:16,800
we just wanted to find a more clever way

1718
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:18,640
of of dealing with it and

1719
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,640
um there are probably a lot of

1720
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:24,000
possibilities to

1721
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:26,880
gain access to the power or or

1722
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
even other features of this um these

1723
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:31,360
scooters and

1724
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:33,120
uh you're free to do uh modifications on

1725
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:35,920
scooters yourselves but

1726
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:37,360
we for this project we wanted to look

1727
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:41,440
for a

1728
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:45,280
stealthy non-destructive non-invasive

1729
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:47,519
parasite that would just extend

1730
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:50,000
the capabilities of the scooter without

1731
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:53,440
interfering with

1732
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:56,480
with its uh original business model

1733
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,480
yeah yeah

1734
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:02,000
you could try uh mounting like a bicycle

1735
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:04,480
dynamo on the wheels maybe

1736
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,480
oh yeah

1737
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:11,840
yeah why not um okay

1738
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,360
anything else you want to add to the

1739
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:17,360
technical

1740
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:17,360
specifics

1741
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:23,599
okay then project in general what are

1742
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:26,719
the reasons to decide to make the

1743
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:30,400
gallery available for only a few days

1744
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:33,760
i'm not sure uh if

1745
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:35,040
if this maybe was a misunderstanding but

1746
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,760
um

1747
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:38,480
no it's sort of a sort of understood

1748
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:41,760
correctly

1749
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:43,919
the show uh the open call show it only

1750
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:46,960
ran for a week in berlin

1751
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:50,480
that is due to um

1752
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:54,000
one uh one reason was that we

1753
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:55,678
just didn't imagine this this module to

1754
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,640
last that long

1755
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:59,360
and we didn't find out until long after

1756
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:03,199
the show

1757
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:04,559
that it would actually survive a trip to

1758
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:07,678
the warehouse

1759
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:10,159
so after a week we thought okay

1760
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:12,400
this is just too too much work because

1761
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:15,199
as we said we were

1762
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:17,280
really like on our bikes every night

1763
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:19,519
checking on these modules checking on

1764
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:22,719
these scooters it was a lot of work and

1765
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,199
um yeah this was just not we could keep

1766
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:26,640
this

1767
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:28,839
sort of um we couldn't we couldn't be a

1768
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:31,840
sharing company for

1769
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:33,520
forever

1770
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,880
yeah maybe maybe i don't know maybe

1771
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:40,000
there's another way to

1772
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:42,400
document it in some some way or so

1773
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,800
well now that we know that these modules

1774
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:48,239
are way more durable than we imagined

1775
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:49,840
we um as we said we are thinking of or

1776
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:53,040
we definitely want to

1777
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:56,080
um repeat this show

1778
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:57,840
in another time another city because

1779
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:00,080
the good thing about these scooters they

1780
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,760
are everywhere now and um as far as we

1781
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:04,320
can tell this uh

1782
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,199
solution that we came up with it works

1783
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:08,639
in every city

1784
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:11,360
so um you're

1785
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:12,080
we also hope that we can repeat this

1786
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,000
somewhere else

1787
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,199
some other time and maybe um

1788
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,080
[Music]

1789
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:19,440
have it be available longer or actually

1790
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:22,159
for as long as

1791
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,159
they will last

1792
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:26,639
yeah are there plans to make roaming

1793
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:29,040
galleries of

1794
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:30,159
on other types of infrastructure like

1795
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:33,440
cars

1796
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:36,239
um or in general what

1797
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:37,120
um what are you planning to do you have

1798
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:38,879
any plans

1799
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:40,640
what you want to do with it in the

1800
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,120
future is there anything

1801
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,120
coming up

1802
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:49,440
that's a very very tough question

1803
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:54,960
now first we go for the cars maybe we

1804
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:55,360
can do like a like a project where

1805
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:58,640
people

1806
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,639
can join in freely

1807
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:04,560
there have been like like many

1808
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:08,159
historical examples of

1809
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:12,080
you know uh you know public free

1810
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:14,639
shared infrastructures and um

1811
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,600
a lot of art projects as well for about

1812
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:19,120
netherlands

1813
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:22,880
uh for example by dania varzeliev

1814
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:25,280
using the the subway

1815
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:26,960
carriages to carry about like mesh

1816
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:30,320
network routers

1817
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:32,800
um we had this tram gem

1818
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:34,320
project that used trams as musical

1819
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:37,520
sequencers

1820
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:40,239
and very nice projects uh so

1821
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:42,640
something i can imagine is maybe like a

1822
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:46,480
collaboration with freifunk

1823
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:50,159
uh providing mesh wi-fi mesh nodes

1824
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:52,959
on roaming devices um but yeah

1825
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:54,000
it's really hard to sort of uh see the

1826
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:57,120
future in in

1827
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,159
times like this yeah maybe you should go

1828
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:01,840
out and find them

1829
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:04,080
out there and just have it go out and

1830
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:07,520
find them is

1831
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:12,000
in the rc2 world and chat about it

1832
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:14,480
um one of our live stream chatters

1833
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,719
uh just shouted to please share the api

1834
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,718
key

1835
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,840
so

1836
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:37,360
i know yay is there

1837
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:38,239
maybe um if there's more questions or

1838
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:42,080
interest

1839
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:44,000
is there maybe a place an assembly or a

1840
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:46,800
special bar where you're hanging around

1841
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,600
later on or tomorrow here at the rc2

1842
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:51,520
world um

1843
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:54,320
i'll see now yeah you know what i mean

1844
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,320
like you're out there

1845
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:57,760
yeah yeah actually

1846
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:01,280
i would like to hang out in the hardware

1847
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,480
hacking area

1848
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:05,040
of the the workshop area in the in the

1849
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:09,199
world

1850
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:11,280
it's a nice space um

1851
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:12,320
yeah maybe you can type the api key

1852
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:15,280
there i mean

1853
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:16,639
copy paste it it's a bit long to to you

1854
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:19,679
know mention it here

1855
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:19,679
it will take all night

1856
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:26,840
okay uh obviously this question is

1857
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:30,080
very interesting so they keep keep

1858
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,719
putting it back so have you seen any

1859
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,719
interesting

1860
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:35,120
moving patterns other than the trip to

1861
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:37,120
the repair facility

1862
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:39,360
seems to be very important so what have

1863
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:42,400
you what have you been

1864
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:44,360
finding well out was just

1865
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:46,320
interesting to see um

1866
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:48,639
[Music]

1867
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:50,400
from what we could tell by looking at

1868
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:54,320
these 11 scooters

1869
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:58,080
specifically we um well

1870
01:21:54,320 --> 01:22:01,440
they were mostly uh being

1871
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:04,559
moved uh during the night or like

1872
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:06,960
uh evening morning um times and not so

1873
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:10,560
much during the day

1874
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:11,520
they some of the scooters we uh selected

1875
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,920
they've never

1876
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:15,280
they've never moved out of nikon one

1877
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:19,040
scooter didn't move

1878
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:21,920
a single time during the whole time we

1879
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:22,960
we watched it and others made uh really

1880
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,360
long trips

1881
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,320
as you could see in the animation there

1882
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:28,559
uh one was

1883
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:29,840
like going crazy towards bedding and

1884
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,760
then um

1885
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:34,000
meeting kobe pitnik scooter was just

1886
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,560
like after one day it was in shallow

1887
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,280
book and

1888
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:42,239
like alone

1889
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:43,120
yeah one one interesting thing is uh for

1890
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:46,320
me was

1891
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:47,760
that um the the rangers or the juicers

1892
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:49,120
the people who swapped the butter

1893
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:52,239
batteries

1894
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:55,360
um yeah like

1895
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:57,440
at the night of the opening um

1896
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:59,440
you know a couple of our scooters

1897
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:01,360
actually ran out of battery

1898
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,559
um that's when we decided to end the

1899
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:05,120
show and

1900
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,679
yeah within uh five minutes there was

1901
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:09,199
this

1902
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:11,280
sixth rental car uh arriving

1903
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:12,719
with a dude jumping out swapping the

1904
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:16,159
batteries

1905
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:18,880
um yeah with the perfect the perfect

1906
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:19,599
ending to our show we had just removed

1907
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,840
the

1908
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:23,360
the modules we had just saved them and

1909
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,639
then these like

1910
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:29,440
guys jump out the this van and then

1911
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:31,600
swap batteries on the scooters and like

1912
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:34,400
nobody believed that we didn't actually

1913
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,679
plan this that it wasn't like a like a

1914
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:38,480
theater piece but it

1915
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:39,120
it was just a nice coincidence one of

1916
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:42,239
the many

1917
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:46,000
coincidences that made this project um

1918
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:49,120
happen in the first place um

1919
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,639
i just have to laugh because we always

1920
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:55,040
say with berliners we don't leave

1921
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:57,440
our kids you always stay in your kids so

1922
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,080
maybe some of the uh the scooters had

1923
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:03,839
the same

1924
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:03,840
um approach to just stay yeah

1925
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:14,080
excuse me yeah you're

1926
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:17,759
absolutely right the scooters seem to

1927
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:20,800
have adapted a very similar lifestyle

1928
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:24,000
yeah yeah

1929
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:25,199
okay there are still more questions are

1930
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:31,520
you still willing to take

1931
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:33,360
questions sure sure okay

1932
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,040
cool would you consider doing some work

1933
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,480
around the badly parked scooters for

1934
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,440
people who are blind or visually

1935
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,599
impaired

1936
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:44,719
did you notice this issue while doing

1937
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:46,960
this project

1938
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:48,560
uh do you have to repeat that question

1939
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,560
huh um he's asking

1940
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,159
and those scooters are parked everywhere

1941
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:54,719
very badly and it's a

1942
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:55,920
it's a dangerous blind or visually

1943
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:59,600
impaired

1944
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:02,639
and you probably noticed it and

1945
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:06,880
maybe you could add this as

1946
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:08,719
um as an aspect or

1947
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:12,320
yeah definitely there's that's one of

1948
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:15,440
the the many things that we um

1949
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:18,480
invite people to like um

1950
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:20,879
maybe uh look out for to

1951
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:22,718
i mean there are a bunch of people

1952
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:23,440
listening who are way more talented than

1953
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:26,480
we are in

1954
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:29,839
um all sorts of uh coming up

1955
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:33,199
uh with code and and and

1956
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:36,080
um ideas and development uh ideas

1957
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:37,839
uh to create add-ons for these scooters

1958
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:39,760
and obviously there are there are

1959
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,600
problems with these scooters that we

1960
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:45,120
didn't even think about

1961
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:47,360
we just tried to find one solution that

1962
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:51,599
would make them more interesting to us

1963
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:54,400
and obviously um there

1964
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:56,159
there's a need for for improvement on

1965
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:59,759
many levels and

1966
01:25:56,159 --> 01:26:04,080
um yeah using using this

1967
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:07,600
uh charger maybe there's a way to like

1968
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:10,880
mount a sensor on top that would

1969
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:13,520
then like give a um sound

1970
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:15,280
feedback to once you're approaching them

1971
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:17,280
or something

1972
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:19,599
um we haven't thought of anything like a

1973
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:22,400
boy or something yeah

1974
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:24,080
yeah well thank you so much um at the

1975
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:27,519
hardware acting hacking area

1976
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:28,639
and the um playground area i don't i

1977
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:31,600
don't repeat that now

1978

yeah it's the same name you're walking

1981
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:41,600
around recognition

1982
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:44,960
no no then you have to find a way to

1983
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:47,199
make yourself remarkable in some way

1984

1988
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,880
and maybe it'll take a while until we

1989
