[Music]

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,520
[Applause]

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,920
[Music]

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,160
all right

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,840
um fellow creatures um to be honest i

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,198
never thought that i would be

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,920
introducing a talk on measuring

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,080
radioactivity like

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,840
ever in my life but then again

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,919
considering the world state

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,558
uh current state at large it might be

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,079
not such a bad idea to be prepared for

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,559
these things right

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,800
and gladly our next speaker oliver

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,160
keller is an expert in detecting

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,360
radioactive

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,800
stuff oliver is a physicist and works at

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,200
one of the most prominent

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,919
nerd happy places did cern since 2013

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,360
is also doing a phd project about novel

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,680
instruments and experiments on natural

22
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,120
radioactivity

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,680
at the university of geneva and to even

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,800
more

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,640
to add even more rc3 pizzazz

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,479
oliver is active in open science

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,680
community and passionate about

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,960
everything open source all that sounds

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,119
really cool to me so without further ado

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,080
let's give a warm virtual welcome to

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,880
oliver

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,039
and let's hear what he has to say about

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,479
measuring radioactivity

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,080
with using low-cost silicon sensors

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,720
oliver the stream is yours

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,119
thanks that was a very nice introduction

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,360
um

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,439
i'm really happy to to have this chance

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,520
to present you i'm a member since

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,798
quite some years and this is my first

41
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,320
ccc talk

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,240
so i'm quite excited um yeah you can

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,919
follow me on twitter or i'm also on

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,119
mastodon not so active

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,159
and most of my stuff is on github

46
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,240
okay so what will we talk about

47
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,759
in this talk i'll give you a short

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,560
overview also about

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,680
radioactivity because yeah it's a topic

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,840
with many different

51
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,159
um details and then we will look at the

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,479
detector more in detail and how that

53
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,840
works in terms of the physics behind it

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,440
and electronics and then finally

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,120
we'll look at things that can be

56
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,400
measured how the measurement actually

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,840
works

58
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,800
what are interesting objects to to check

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,560
and how this relates to silicon

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,560
detectors being used at cern

61
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,160
so the project is on github called diy

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,839
particle detector

63
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,760
it's an electronic design which is open

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,160
hardware there's a wiki

65
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,200
with lots of further details for

66
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,319
building and

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,359
for troubleshooting there's a little web

68
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,839
browser tool

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,440
i will show later briefly and there are

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,879
scripts to record

71
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,760
and nicely plot the measurements those

72
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,599
scripts are bsd licensed and this is

73
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,679
written in python

74
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,599
there are two variants of this detector

75
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,400
one is called electron detector

76
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,079
the other one alpha spectrometer they

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,319
use the same circuit board

78
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,120
but one is using four diets the other

79
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,760
one one

80
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,640
for the diet there's a small difference

81
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,239
between them

82
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,079
but in general it's pretty similar but

83
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,000
the electron detector is much easier to

84
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,560
build and much easier to get started

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,280
using then you have complete part lists

86
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,640
and even a complete kit can be bought on

87
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,360
kidspace.org

88
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,720
which is an open hardware community

89
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,720
repository

90
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,159
and i really recommend you to check it

91
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,920
out it's a great

92
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,640
community platform and everyone can

93
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,839
register their their own github

94
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,480
project quite easily

95
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,440
now this is a particle detector in a

96
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,480
team box

97
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,920
so you can use the famous altoids tin

98
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,079
box

99
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,679
or something for swiss chocolate for

100
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,480
example

101
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,319
you can see it's rather small board

102
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,280
about the size of a nine volt block

103
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,560
battery

104
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,599
and then you need in addition about 20

105
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,640
resistor resistors capacitors

106
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,959
and these um silicon diodes

107
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,079
plus an operational amplifier which is

108
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,000
this little

109
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,680
chip here just little black chip here on

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,639
the right side you can see it's all

111
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,358
old-school

112
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,959
large components this is on purpose so

113
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,400
it's easy to solder for

114
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,000
complete electronic beginners and this

115
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,400
by the way this picture is already

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,759
one user of this project to post it

117
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,400
their own build

118
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,400
on twitter

119
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,600
okay so natural radioactivity so

120
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,599
i would say it's a story of many

121
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,520
misconceptions

122
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,840
let's imagine we are this little stick

123
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,120
figure here on the ground

124
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,560
below us we have uranium and thorium

125
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,520
we also have potassium 40 in the ground

126
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,840
and potassium 40 is is pretty specific

127
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,400
and

128
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,280
peculiar it actually makes all of us a

129
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:03,840
little bit radioactive

130
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,638
every human is has about 4 000 to 5 000

131
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,719
radioactive

132
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,400
decays every second because of the

133
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,560
natural potassium

134
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,159
and natural potassium comes with a

135
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,160
radioactive isotope

136
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,320
which is just everywhere it's in bananas

137
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,479
but it's also in us because we need it

138
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,240
for our body chemistry it's really

139
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,479
important

140
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,960
and even some some of those decays are

141
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,000
even producing antimatter

142
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,880
so how cool is that okay so what would

143
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,919
we

144
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,240
be measuring on the on ground well there

145
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,000
could be some gamma rays or electrons

146
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,280
and those are from beta decays or from

147
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,199
the uranium

148
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,758
there is one radionuclide appearing in

149
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,720
the decay chain which is called radon

150
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,759
and the radon is actually a gas so from

151
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,800
the ground

152
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,759
the radon can diffuse upwards and travel

153
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,880
with air

154
00:05:53,759 --> 00:06:00,319
and spread around so it's a bit

155
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,639
like a like a vehicle for radioactivity

156
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,880
from the ground to spread to other

157
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,720
places

158
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,520
and that radon would decay with alpha

159
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,479
particles producing electrons in beta

160
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,479
decays

161
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,880
and also gamma radiation further down in

162
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,039
the decay chain

163
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,560
so just to recapitulate i've said it

164
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,318
already

165
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,319
twice so alpha particles

166
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,240
are actually helium nuclei

167
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,960
so it's just two protons and two

168
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,240
neutrons

169
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,840
and the electrons are missing and in an

170
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,000
um beta decay basically one neutron

171
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,080
is transformed into a proton and an

172
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,240
electron and there's also an

173
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,000
electron anti-neutrino generated but

174
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,759
this is super hard to measure

175
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,639
so we're not measuring those mostly we

176
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,840
will be measuring electrons

177
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,120
um from beta decays that's why you see

178
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,159
all these little e's

179
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,759
indicating beta decays okay if you would

180
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,400
go to the hospital here

181
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:08,000
on the left side we would probably

182
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,599
find some x-rays from

183
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,599
checking our bones or something like

184
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,479
this or even gamma rays

185
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,599
or alpha particles being used in

186
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,159
treatments

187
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,240
or very modern even proton beams are

188
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,039
sometimes generated for

189
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,240
medical applications now here on the

190
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,960
right side if you go

191
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,680
close to a nuclear power plant we

192
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,919
probably

193
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,720
measure nothing unless there's a problem

194
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,758
in this case

195
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,840
most likely we would find some gamma

196
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,560
radiation

197
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,039
but only if there's a problem okay and

198
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,520
then

199
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,400
actually that's not the whole story this

200
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,719
is terrestrial radiation

201
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,440
but we also have radiation coming from

202
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,680
upwards

203
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,879
showering down on us every minute and

204
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,080
there's actually nothing we can do

205
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,440
against it

206
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,440
so protons are accelerated from

207
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,120
in the universe basically the the

208
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,240
biggest particle accelerator

209
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,840
nature has and once they hit our

210
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,840
atmosphere

211
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:11,039
they break apart into less energetic

212
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,440
particles and it's many of them so

213
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,400
in the first stage there's lots of ions

214
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,000
generated

215
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,758
and also neutrons but neutrons are

216
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,960
really hard to measure so

217
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,759
i'll ignore them for most of the talk

218
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,799
then those pions can decay into gamma

219
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,919
rays

220
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,960
and then trigger a whole chain of

221
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,360
positron electron decays which again

222
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,559
um create gamma rays and so forth and

223
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,479
this goes actually

224
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,319
the whole way down to the earth we will

225
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,519
have a little bit of that

226
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,159
on on the sea level and the other more

227
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,959
known

228
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,160
part of atmospheric radiation is

229
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,119
actually muons

230
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,120
so some ions decay into muons which is

231
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,839
kind of a heavy electron

232
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,240
and also in neutrinos but neutrinos are

233
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,200
again

234
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,760
very hard to measure so i'll ignore them

235
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,920
for most of this talk

236
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,519
and if you look here on the right side

237
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,519
on this altitude scale

238
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,279
you'll see an airplane would be

239
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,519
basically traveling where

240
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,360
most of the atmospheric radiation is

241
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,560
produced and this is why if you go on

242
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,519
such an airplane

243
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,719
you have actually several times more

244
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,000
radiation

245
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,800
in there than here on earth and of

246
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,480
course

247
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,839
on the ground it also depends where you

248
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,080
are there are different

249
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,880
amounts of renewamentorium in the ground

250
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,920
and this is just

251
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,439
naturally there so but in

252
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,920
depends on the geology of course

253
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,880
okay so i've talked quite a bit about

254
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,519
radiation and

255
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,399
i'm saying i want to use silicon to

256
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,360
detect it

257
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,080
so what what radiation exactly maybe

258
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,640
let's

259
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,120
let's um take a step back and think

260
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,199
about

261
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,480
what we know maybe from school so we

262
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,160
have this rainbow

263
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:57,279
for for visible light right this is

264
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,640
in terms of wavelength we have 800

265
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:04,160
to 400 nanometers spanning from

266
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:07,920
the infrared red area to over green

267
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,959
to blue and into the violet

268
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,199
and lower than those

269
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,479
wavelengths or let's say bigger

270
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,640
millimeter waves

271
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,720
meter waves and even kilometer that

272
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,800
would be radio waves radio frequencies

273
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,839
for our digital communication systems

274
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,959
wi-fi

275
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,760
mobile devices and so forth but i want

276
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,239
to look actually

277
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,360
more towards the right because that's

278
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,600
what we are

279
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,880
measuring with these detectors it's a

280
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,320
shorter wavelength

281
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,560
which actually means higher energy so

282
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,959
on the right side we would be having

283
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,760
ultraviolet radiation

284
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,359
which is kind of at the border to what

285
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:50,319
we can measure and these 800 to 400

286
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,600
nanometers translate into 1.5 to 3

287
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,680
electron volts

288
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,959
which is a unit that particle physicists

289
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,640
really prefer

290
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:01,760
because it basically relates

291
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:05,760
the energy of an electron

292
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,880
after it has been accelerated by 1 volt

293
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,640
and makes it much easier to work with

294
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,839
with nuclear or particle physics because

295
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,279
everything

296
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:18,560
all the energy is always related to

297
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,480
an electron and this ana

298
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,640
this formula here is just a reminder

299
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,279
that the wavelength can be always

300
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,480
converted into energy and it's inversely

301
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,240
proportional so

302
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,680
wavelength increases to the left and the

303
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,680
energy to the right

304
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,719
and if you increase energy more from

305
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,160
from the visible

306
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,800
range so let's say thousands of electron

307
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,199
volts

308
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,120
then we arrive here millions mega

309
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,920
electron volts even giga electron volts

310
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,200
and there's now a pretty important

311
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,040
distinction between

312
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,200
those two areas and that is

313
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,560
the right one is ionizing radiation and

314
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,959
the left one is non-ionizing radiation

315
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,920
uv is a little bit in the middle of that

316
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,800
so some

317
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,760
parts of the uv spectrum can be ionizing

318
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,399
it also depends

319
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,040
a lot on the material that the radiation

320
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,720
is interacting with

321
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,800
for these detectors i'm talking about

322
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,959
today and alpha beta gamma radiation

323
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,160
this is all ionizing

324
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,880
so some examples lowest energy on the

325
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,680
lower

326
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,240
spectrum would be x-rays then electrons

327
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,599
gammas from

328
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,120
radioactive radionuclides

329
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,440
that i already talked about in the

330
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,760
previous slide alpha particles

331
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,120
and then muons from the atmosphere would

332
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,519
be more in the

333
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,279
eager electron volts range and so forth

334
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,920
and for these higher energies of course

335
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,920
you need something like the lhc to

336
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,839
accelerate particles to really high

337
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,719
energies

338
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,839
and then you can even access the terra

339
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,440
electron volts regime

340
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:58,480
okay um silicon diets

341
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,160
what kind of silicon diets i'm using uh

342
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,440
in this project low cost silicon pin

343
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,560
diodes

344
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,880
one is called bp w34

345
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,399
it's manufactured from vishai or osram

346
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,040
it costs about 50 cents

347
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,600
so that's what i mean with low cost

348
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,160
there's another one called bpx61 from

349
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,240
osram

350
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,639
it's quite a bit more expensive this is

351
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,720
the lower one here on the right

352
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,399
it has a metal case which is the main

353
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,240
reason why it's more expensive but it's

354
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,360
quite interesting because that one

355
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,079
we can use for the alpha detector if you

356
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,959
look closely there is a glass on top

357
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,160
but we can remove that we have a

358
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,040
sensitive area

359
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,880
so this chip is roughly seven square

360
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,120
millimeters large

361
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,839
and it has a thickness a sensitive

362
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,959
thickness of about a 50 micrometer

363
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,160
which is not a lot so it's basically the

364
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,518
half

365
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,439
of the width of a human hair and

366
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,639
in total it's a really small sensitive

367
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,920
volume but it's

368
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,920
it's enough to measure something

369
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,560
and just as a reminder how much of

370
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,440
gammas or x-rays we would detect with

371
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,800
this

372
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,920
not a lot because this high energetic

373
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,639
photon radiation kind

374
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,519
doesn't interact very well in any kind

375
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,760
of matter

376
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,199
and because a sensitive area is so thin

377
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,519
it will basically

378
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,479
permeate through it and most of the

379
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,320
times

380
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,320
not interact and doesn't make a signal

381
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,399
okay what's really important since we

382
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,440
don't want to measure

383
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,399
light we have to shield light the waves

384
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,760
we need to block

385
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,399
all of the light that means easiest way

386
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,079
to do it

387
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,959
is to put it in a metal case there it's

388
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:42,719
electromagnetically shielded

389
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,279
and completely protected from light as

390
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,000
well electromagnetic radiation or radio

391
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,040
waves

392
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,760
can also influence this these detectors

393
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,079
because they are super sensitive

394
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,399
so it should be a complete faraday cage

395
00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:00,399
complete metal structure around it

396
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:02,720
there's lots of of hints and

397
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:06,399
tips how to achieve that on the wiki on

398
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,399
the on the github of this project

399
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,079
okay let's think about one of those pin

400
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,439
diets

401
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:16,479
normally there's there is one part

402
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,000
in the silicon which is n

403
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,519
dot um and doped negatively doped

404
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,839
and there's another part usually which

405
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,680
is positively doped

406
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,079
and then you arrive at a simple

407
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,079
so-called pn junction which is a regular

408
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,560
semiconducting diet

409
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,199
now pin diets add another layer a

410
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,758
so-called

411
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:40,399
intrinsic layer here shown with the eye

412
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,279
and that actually is uh the main

413
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,440
advantage

414
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,040
why this kind of detector works quite

415
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,160
well

416
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,279
and has a relatively uh large

417
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,160
sensitive signals so if you if you think

418
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,680
about

419
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,819
let's say a photon from an x-ray or

420
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,920
a gamma decay or an electron

421
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,839
[Music]

422
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,040
hitting the sensor so i'm and by the way

423
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,600
this is a cross-section

424
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,040
view from the side yeah but okay so it

425
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,079
doesn't really matter but let's say

426
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,519
they come here from the top into into

427
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,160
the

428
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,440
into the diet and we're looking at the

429
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,519
site

430
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,120
then we have actually ionization because

431
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,480
this is ionizing radiation

432
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,160
so we get free charges in the form of

433
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
electron hole pairs so the electrons

434
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,439
would

435
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,680
be here the blue ball and the red circle

436
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,959
would be the holes

437
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,359
and depending on the radiation kind how

438
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,319
this ionization takes place is quite

439
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,360
different

440
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,399
but the result is if you get a signal

441
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,199
it means there was ionization now

442
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,759
if just this would happen we could not

443
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,719
measure anything

444
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,279
those charges would quickly recombine

445
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,440
and

446
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,320
on the outside of the diode there would

447
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,440
be a little

448
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,040
signal but what we can do is we can

449
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,639
apply actually a voltage from the

450
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,720
outside

451
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:07,359
so here we just put a battery

452
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,799
so we have a positive voltage here a

453
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,280
couple of volts

454
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,639
and then what happens is that the

455
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,240
electrons will be attracted by the

456
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,839
positive voltage

457
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,480
and the holes will travel to the

458
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,520
negative

459
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,240
potential and we end up

460
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,480
with a little net current or a small

461
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,799
bunch of charges

462
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,520
that can be measured across the diode as

463
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:35,760
a tiny tiny current peak

464
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,520
the sensitive volume is actually

465
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,879
proportional to the voltage so the more

466
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,720
voltage we put the more

467
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,919
the bigger is our volume and the more we

468
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,679
can actually measure

469
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,160
with certain limits of course because

470
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,240
the structure of the pin diet has a

471
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,840
maximum thickness just according how it

472
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,840
is manufactured

473
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,320
and these properties can be estimated

474
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,200
with cv measurements

475
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,000
so here you see an example of a couple

476
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,480
of diets

477
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,039
a few of the same type the two that i've

478
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,039
mentioned

479
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,360
there are different versions one has a

480
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,320
transparent plastic case one has a black

481
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,760
plastic case

482
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,080
it doesn't really matter you see

483
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,799
basically in all the cases

484
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,799
more or less the same curve and as you

485
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,840
increase the voltage the capacitance

486
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,520
goes down

487
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,600
this is great and basically shows us

488
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,480
that those silicon chips are very

489
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,959
similar

490
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,360
if not exactly the same chip those

491
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,720
differences are easily explained by

492
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,479
manufacturing

493
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,480
variances and then

494
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,919
because this actually if you think about

495
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,799
it it looks a bit like a

496
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,480
parallel plate capacitor and actually

497
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,280
you can treat it as one

498
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,120
and if you know the capacitance and the

499
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,120
size the area

500
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,879
you can actually calculate the distance

501
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,600
of these two plates or

502
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,120
basically the width or the thickness of

503
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,080
the diet

504
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,439
and then we arrive at about yeah 50

505
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,678
micrometer

506
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,679
if you put something like 8 or 10 volts

507
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,440
okay now we have a tiny charge current

508
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,280
now we need to amplify it

509
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,640
so we have here a couple of diodes i'm

510
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,639
explaining now the electron detector

511
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,679
because it's easier we have four diodes

512
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,440
at the input like and this is the symbol

513
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,240
for an operational amplifier

514
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,200
there are two of those in this circuit

515
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,280
the first stage

516
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,120
is really the special one so if you have

517
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,480
a particle strike in the diode we get a

518
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,360
little charge current

519
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,039
hitting the amplifier and then we have

520
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,799
here this important feedback circuit so

521
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:39,200
the output is feedback into the input

522
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,559
which in this case makes a negative

523
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,080
amplification

524
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,280
and the amplification is defined

525
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,280
actually by this capacitance here

526
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,799
the resistor has a secondary role the

527
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,360
small capacitance

528
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,520
it is what makes the output voltage here

529
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,639
larger the smaller the capacitance

530
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,918
the larger the output and it's inverted

531
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,080
then in the next amplifier step we just

532
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,039
increase the voltage again to a level

533
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,840
that is useful

534
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,039
for using it later but all of the signal

535
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,799
quality

536
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,879
that's that has been achieved in the

537
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,240
first stage will stay like that so

538
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,559
signal to noise

539
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,080
is defined by the first stage the second

540
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,720
one is just to

541
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,000
to better adapt it um to the input of

542
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,360
the measurement device

543
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
that's connected so here this is a

544
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,678
classical inverting amplifier where just

545
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,440
these two resistors define the

546
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,919
amplification factor it's very simple

547
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,039
it's just

548
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,520
a factor of 100 in this case

549
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,799
and so if you think again about the

550
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,200
charge pulse and this

551
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:41,039
this circuit here is sensitive starting

552
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,080
from about 1000

553
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:49,039
liberated charges in those diets

554
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:52,480
as a result from ionization

555
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,760
we get something like 320 microvolt at

556
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,919
this first output

557
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,200
and this is a spike that quickly

558
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,280
decreases

559
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,600
is basically these capacitors are

560
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,158
charged and quickly discharged with this

561
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,039
resistor and this is what we see here

562
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,400
and then that is amplified again by a

563
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,640
factor of 100

564
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,880
and then we arrive at something like at

565
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,679
least 32 millivolts

566
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,840
which is conveniently a voltage that is

567
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,039
compatible with most microphone or

568
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,559
headset inputs

569
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:24,879
of computers or mobile phones so

570
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,559
a regular headset here has these four

571
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,400
connectors and the last ring

572
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,520
actually connects the microphone the

573
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:35,440
other is ground and draft light

574
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:38,080
left right for the earbuds

575
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,360
okay how do we record those pulses um

576
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,840
this is an example of

577
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,760
thousand pulses overlaid

578
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,360
um measured on an oscilloscope here so

579
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,840
it's a bit more accurate you see

580
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,959
the pulses bit better this is kind of

581
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,158
like the persistence

582
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,400
mode of an oscilloscope

583
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,000
and the size of the pulse is

584
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,880
proportional to the energy that

585
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,799
was absorbed and then the circuit is

586
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,280
made in such a way that the width of the

587
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,240
pulse

588
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,320
is big enough such that a regular

589
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,720
sampling frequency of a sound card can

590
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,760
actually catch it and measure it

591
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,320
um yeah this is a potassium salt this is

592
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,559
cut here

593
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,158
this is called a low salt in the uk

594
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,320
there's also german variants you can

595
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:24,400
also just buy it in the pharmacy

596
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,559
um or in certain organic food stores

597
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,320
stores as a replacement salt on the

598
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,678
right side is an example

599
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,720
from this small columbine stone

600
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,240
which has traces of uranium on it

601
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,080
and this is measured with the alpha

602
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,760
spectrometer and

603
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,000
you see those pulses are quite a bit

604
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,600
bigger here we have 50 microseconds and

605
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,480
here we have more like one

606
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,480
milliseconds of pulse width

607
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,679
now there's a software um on a browser

608
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,879
this is something

609
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,720
i wrote using the web audio api and it

610
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,919
works

611
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,480
on most browsers best is chrome on ios

612
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,640
of course you have to use safari

613
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,520
and that records once you plug the

614
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,240
detector it records from the input at 48

615
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,760
or 44.1 kilohertz the pulses

616
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,320
here's an example with the alpha

617
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,960
spectrometer circuit you get these nice

618
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,439
large pulses in case of the electron

619
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,400
detector the pulse is much shorter

620
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,559
and you see you see the noise much more

621
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,919
amplified this red line is kind of the

622
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,240
minimum level that

623
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,000
the piles needs to trigger these will be

624
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,840
bigger and that's like the trigger level

625
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,559
of an oscilloscope

626
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,360
you can set that with those buttons in

627
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,240
the browser

628
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,199
you need to find a good way you of

629
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,760
course if you change

630
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,159
your input volume settings for example

631
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,520
this will change so you have to

632
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:51,679
remember which with with which settings

633
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,760
it works well

634
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,960
and this pulse for example is even

635
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,679
oscillating here so

636
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,679
for electron detector it's basically

637
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,679
nice to count particles

638
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,840
and for the alpha detector it's really

639
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,760
the case where the size of the pulse can

640
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,120
be nicely evaluated

641
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,879
and we can actually do energy

642
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,479
measurements

643
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,320
and these energy measurements can be

644
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,600
also called spectrometry

645
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,120
so if you look closer at these

646
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:22,719
many pulses that have been recorded and

647
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:25,760
we find that there is really like

648
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,159
much more intensity which means many

649
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,799
more

650
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,840
same pulses were detected we can relate

651
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,480
it to radium

652
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,158
and radon if we use a reference alpha

653
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,520
source and i have done this i have

654
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,919
measured the whole circuit with the

655
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,000
reference sources and provide

656
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,360
the calibration on github and you can

657
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,679
reuse the github

658
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,559
calibration if you use exactly the same

659
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,640
sound

660
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:50,480
settings that i have used for recording

661
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,320
and for example these two very weak

662
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,640
lines here are from

663
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,480
um two very distinctive polonium

664
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,600
isotopes

665
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,559
from uranium k chain

666
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,120
um the top part here which is really

667
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,840
dark

668
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,639
corresponds basically in the histogram

669
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,639
view

670
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,840
to this side on the left which is

671
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,039
electrons

672
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,879
most of these electrons they will

673
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,720
actually enter the chip and leave it out

674
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,679
um

675
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,000
without being completely absorbed by it

676
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,720
but alpha particles interact so strongly

677
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
that they are

678
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,159
completely absorbed within the 50

679
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,159
micrometers

680
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:30,240
of sensitive volume of these diets and

681
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,159
okay here's a bit difficult to see peaks

682
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,720
but far end

683
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,640
of the high energy spectrum you see two

684
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,880
really clear peaks and those

685
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,679
uh stem can only stem from polonium

686
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,159
actually

687
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,279
i mean we know it's uranium and that can

688
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,320
only be polonium

689
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:50,960
which is that isotope that produces

690
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:55,039
the most energetic alpha particles

691
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,960
in and which is natural and

692
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,480
i said if you use the same setting like

693
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,159
me you can use it so

694
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,240
the best is if you use actually the same

695
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,559
sound card because they are

696
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,640
if you put it to 100 input sensitivity

697
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,879
you will have exactly the same result

698
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,000
like in my calibration case and this

699
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,840
sound card is pretty cheap

700
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,600
but also pretty good it costs just two

701
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,720
dollars and has a pretty

702
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,000
range and resolves quite well 16 bits

703
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,240
and think oh you can

704
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,600
do that with an arduino as well it's

705
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,640
actually a bit hard

706
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:28,080
to do a really well 16-bit

707
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,799
measurement even at 48 kilohertz

708
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,480
it's not so easy and this keeps it cheap

709
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,039
and kind of straightforward and you can

710
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,320
have

711
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,559
just some python scripts on your

712
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,439
computer to read it out and this is as a

713
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,639
reminder

714
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,400
in order to to measure alpha particles

715
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,159
we have to remove the glass here on top

716
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,919
of the diet so i'm doing it just with

717
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,799
cutting into the metal frame

718
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,559
and then the glass breaks away easily

719
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,879
this is not a problem there's more on

720
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,918
that

721
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:58,080
on the wiki now we can kind of compare

722
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,159
alpha and gamma spectrometry and here

723
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,199
here's an example

724
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,919
this is a uranium-glazed ceramics the

725
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,240
red part

726
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,159
is uranium oxide that was used to create

727
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,520
this nice red color in the 50s

728
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:14,640
60s 70s and in the spectrum we have two

729
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,158
very distinctive peaks and nothing in

730
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,840
the high energy regime

731
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,559
only this low energy range has a signal

732
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,799
and this corresponds actually to

733
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:25,678
uranium-238

734
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,279
and 234 because they use actually

735
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,720
purified uranium

736
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,240
so all of the high-energy progeny or

737
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,600
daughters of uranium they are not

738
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,320
present here

739
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,760
because that was purified uranium and

740
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,760
this measurement doesn't even need

741
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,120
vacuum i put it just like this in a

742
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,279
regular box

743
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,520
of course if you would have vacuum you

744
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,159
would improve these peaks by a lot so

745
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,158
this widening here to the left basically

746
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,880
that this peak is almost below the other

747
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,480
one

748
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,039
that is due to the natural air

749
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,000
at a regular air pressure which already

750
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,799
interacts

751
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,360
a lot with the particles and absorbs a

752
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,120
lot of energy before the particles hit

753
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,360
the sensor

754
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,120
so in terms of pros and cons i would say

755
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,080
and the small sensor

756
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,719
is quite interesting here in alpha

757
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,960
spectrometry because

758
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,399
you it's enough to have a small sensor

759
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,360
so it's cheap

760
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,120
and you can measure very precisely on

761
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,240
specific spots

762
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,080
and on the other hand of course

763
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,000
the the conditions of the object

764
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,439
influence the measurement a lot so for

765
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,600
example if there are some

766
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,880
additional paint on top the alpha

767
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,678
particles might not

768
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,320
make it through but in most of these

769
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,200
kind of

770
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,760
samples alpha irradiation actually makes

771
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,760
it

772
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:46,480
through the top transparent paint layer

773
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,840
in terms of gamma spectrometry you would

774
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,039
usually have these huge

775
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,480
and really expensive sensors and then

776
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,960
the advantage of course is

777
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,520
that you can measure regardless of your

778
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,159
object

779
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,120
um you don't really need to prepare the

780
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,039
object a lot

781
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,320
you might want some led shielding around

782
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,399
it

783
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,000
and that's again expensive but okay at

784
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,678
least you can do it you can improve the

785
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,480
measurement like that

786
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,120
and it's it's basically costly because

787
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,159
the sensor is quite

788
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:19,199
expensive while versus in this setup

789
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,520
for 15 to 30 euro you have everything

790
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,840
you need and here you're looking at

791
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,960
several hundred to several thousand

792
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,879
euros

793
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,960
okay now measuring i have to be a bit

794
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,080
quicker now i notice

795
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,440
um so i thought i talked already about

796
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,960
the potassium salt

797
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,480
there's also fertilizer based on

798
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,720
potassium baking powder

799
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,279
uranium glass is quite nice you can find

800
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,080
that easily on flue markets

801
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:49,039
often also old radium watches here's

802
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,639
another example of a uranium glazed

803
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,399
kitchen tile in this case this was

804
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,799
actually in the kitchen so the chances

805
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,199
are

806
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,520
that you at home find actually some of

807
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,000
those things in the cupboards of your

808
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,840
parents or your grandparents this is an

809
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,840
example of toriated glass which has this

810
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,279
distinctive brownish color which

811
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,520
actually is from the radiation

812
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,880
and a nice little experiment that i can

813
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,720
really recommend you to

814
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,240
look up is called radioactive balloon

815
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,240
experiment

816
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,919
uh here you charge the balloon

817
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,679
electrostatically and then it will catch

818
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,120
polonium from the air

819
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,679
and that's really great you basically

820
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,678
get a radioactive balloon after it was

821
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,399
just left for 15 minutes in a normal

822
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,399
regular room

823
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:36,320
okay now the last kind of context

824
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,959
of all of this to end this presentation

825
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,200
um

826
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,279
i want to quickly remind how important

827
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,559
these silicon detectors are for

828
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:46,240
places like cern this is a cross-section

829
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,559
through the output detector

830
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,480
and here you have basically the area

831
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,760
where the collisions happen in the atlas

832
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,320
detector so this is

833
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,279
just a fraction of a meter and you have

834
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,879
today

835
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,760
50 to 100 head-on collisions of two

836
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,120
protons

837
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:06,240
happening every 25 nanoseconds

838
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,678
not right now but soon again machines

839
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,240
will be started again

840
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,240
next year

841
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,199
and you also can by the way build a

842
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,918
similar project which has a slightly

843
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,360
different name

844
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,919
it's called build your own particle

845
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,840
detector this is a atlas

846
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,440
made out of lego and on this website you

847
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,000
find a nice

848
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,760
plan how to build or ideas how to build

849
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,880
it from lego

850
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:35,039
to better visualize the size and yeah

851
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,600
interact more with particle physics

852
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,480
in case of the cms detector um this is

853
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,559
the second biggest detector at cern

854
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,399
here you see nicely that in the middle

855
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,600
at the core of the collision

856
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:51,360
you have many many pixel and microscope

857
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,360
detectors which are made of silicon

858
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:58,879
and these are actually 16 square meters

859
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,559
of silicon pixel detectors and 200

860
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,640
square meters of microstrip

861
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,559
detectors also made of silicon so

862
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,919
without basically that silicon

863
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,840
technology

864
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,159
and boron detectors wouldn't work

865
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,559
because this fine segmentation

866
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,600
is really required to distinguish all of

867
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,399
these newly

868
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,879
created particles as a result of the

869
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,879
collision

870
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,039
so to summarize um the website

871
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,479
some github there's really this big wiki

872
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,679
which you should have a look at and

873
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,799
there's a gallery of

874
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,799
of pictures from users there's a some

875
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,799
simulation software that i used as well

876
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,639
and i didn't develop it but i wrote um

877
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,440
how to use it because this backtrack can

878
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,279
sometimes be difficult to interpret

879
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,720
and there's a new discussions forum that

880
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,240
i would really

881
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,799
appreciate if some of you had some

882
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,960
discussions there on github

883
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,000
and most of the things i showed today

884
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,600
are actually

885
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,880
written in detail in a scientific

886
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,719
article which is open access of course

887
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,880
and i want to highlight two related

888
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,200
citizen science projects

889
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,320
on the one hand this is safecast which

890
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,240
is about

891
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:09,439
a large nice sensitive um geiger muller

892
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,519
based detector that has a gps and people

893
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,760
upload their measurements there

894
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,279
this is quite nice and also open tiger

895
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,120
is another website

896
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,039
mostly german content but also some of

897
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,158
it is english that also uses

898
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,120
um diode detectors showed many nice

899
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,880
places

900
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,120
he calls it geiger caching and so places

901
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,880
around the world where you can measure

902
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,918
something some old mines things like

903
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,480
this

904
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,760
and yeah if you want updates i would

905
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,720
propose to follow me

906
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,960
on twitter i'm right now writing up to

907
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,200
other articles with more ideas

908
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,159
for measurements and some of the things

909
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,559
you have seen

910
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,559
today thanks a lot

911
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,199
well uh thanks a lot uh oliver i hope

912
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,600
everyone can hear me now again

913
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,039
um yes thanks for mentioning the citizen

914
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,080
science projects as well

915
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:06,399
it's really cool i think we do have a

916
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,319
few minutes for the q and a and also a

917
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:12,239
lot of questions coming up

918
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:15,839
in our instance at the irc

919
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:17,279
so the first question uh was uh can you

920
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,159
talk a bit more about the

921
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,399
snr of the system did you pick

922
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,599
particular resistor values and

923
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,440
opm's optimized for noise um was it a

924
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,879
problem

925
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:34,639
yeah so noise is the big issue here um

926
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,520
basically the the amplifier is is one i

927
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,560
found that

928
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,839
this around four four euros i'm trying

929
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,879
to find the slide

930
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:47,119
um yeah you have to look it up on github

931
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,440
the amplifier type but this is the most

932
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,320
important one and then actually the

933
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,520
the resistors are here the resistors in

934
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,119
the first stage

935
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,719
sorry the capacitors is the second

936
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,800
important thing they should be really

937
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:02,799
small since i'm limited here with

938
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,359
with hand solderable capacitors

939
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,960
basically i choose the one that were

940
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,040
just

941
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,119
still available let's say and this is

942
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,040
basically what is available is basically

943
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,280
a 10 picofarad capacitor

944
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,520
if you put two of them one after another

945
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,839
you half the capacitance so you get five

946
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,240
and this by the way is also then the

947
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:25,839
capacitor so i kind of try to

948
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:29,118
keep the same same

949
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:30,799
same resistor values as much as possible

950
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,720
and here at the output for example this

951
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,320
is to adjust the output signal for a

952
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,879
microphone input

953
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,160
in the alpha spectrometer i changed the

954
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,280
values quite a bit

955
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,118
to make a large pulse um

956
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,119
but yeah it's basically playing with the

957
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:49,119
time constants of this

958
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,119
this network and and this network

959
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,560
all right i hope that answers and

960
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,640
question for the person

961
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,040
yeah but people can get in contact with

962
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,319
you right after the talk maybe

963
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,240
as well so there's another question um

964
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:08,079
have you considered using an

965
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:11,598
i2s codec with a raspberry pi uh

966
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,440
ration marks radiation h-a-t

967
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,880
um should be almost now set up and

968
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,119
completely repeatable

969
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,119
so last ones are of a comment

970
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,920
uh i don't know that component but um

971
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,760
yeah as i said um

972
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,839
using a sound card is actually quite

973
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:31,359
straightforward but of course there's

974
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:32,240
many ways to um to yeah get fancy and

975
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,839
this is really

976
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,520
this should actually attract the

977
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,880
teachers and high school students as

978
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,200
well this project so

979
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,320
this is one of the main reasons why

980
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,000
certain

981
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,000
technologies have been chosen rather

982
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,440
simple than

983
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,560
let's say fancy yeah so it

984
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,200
should work with a lot of people i guess

985
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,279
and one another question was how

986
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,000
consistent are the sound cards

987
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,800
um did you find the same calibration

988
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,720
worked

989
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,800
the same with several of them

990
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,000
so yeah so if you want to use my

991
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,560
calibration

992
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
you should really buy this two dollar

993
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,440
card from ebay

994
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,760
cm 108 um i've

995
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,280
i've haven't seen a big difference from

996
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,400
card to card

997
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,760
in in this one but of course like from

998
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,839
one computer to the

999
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,240
mobile phone is a huge difference in

1000
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,720
input sensitivity and noise

1001
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,160
and um it's very difficult to reuse

1002
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,279
calibration in this case but

1003
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,560
you still can count particles um and

1004
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:40,320
the electron detector is is anyway

1005
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,759
um mostly it actually just makes sense

1006
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,200
for counting because the electrons are

1007
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,880
not completely absorbed so

1008
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,439
you get an energy information but it's

1009
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,079
not the complete energy of the electron

1010
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,760
so um yeah you could use it for x-rays

1011
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,440
but then you need an x-ray machine

1012
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,240
so yeah who doesn't need an x-ray

1013
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,000
machine right

1014
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,000
yeah so maybe one question i have

1015
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,359
because i'm not very familiar with the

1016
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,520
tech stuff but what actually can be done

1017
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:10,078
with it right in the field so

1018
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,880
um you mentioned some working with

1019
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,240
teachers

1020
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,160
with with these detectors um

1021
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,479
what have you done with that in the

1022
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,598
while so to say

1023
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,320
um so what's quite nice is you can

1024
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,000
characterize stones with it for example

1025
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,359
so since you can connect it

1026
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,640
to a smartphone it's completely mobile

1027
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:34,160
um and it goes quite well in combination

1028
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,440
with a geiger counter in this case so

1029
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,960
with a geiger counter you just look

1030
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,040
around where whereas

1031
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,040
some hot spots and then you can go

1032
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,160
closer with the alpha spectrometer and

1033
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,880
actually

1034
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,799
be sure that there is some traces of

1035
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,320
thorium or uranium on the stone for

1036
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:53,119
example

1037
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:56,000
or in this types of ceramic

1038
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,160
these old ceramics you can go to the

1039
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,119
flue market and just look for these very

1040
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,598
bright red

1041
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,880
ceramics and measure them on the spot

1042
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,760
and then decide

1043
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,760
which one to buy

1044
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:12,399
okay so that's what i'm going to do with

1045
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,720
right thanks for for highlighting a bit

1046
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,119
the practicals i think it's really cool

1047
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:20,799
to educate people about

1048
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:24,240
some scientific things as well um

1049
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,800
another um question from the irc didn't

1050
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,799
you have

1051
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,560
problems with common mode rejection

1052
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,720
while connecting your device

1053
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,000
to the sound card it yes have you tried

1054
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,200
to do

1055
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
a ad conversion digitization on the

1056
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,078
board itself

1057
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:43,119
already transfer transfer wire sp

1058
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,760
diff question mark yeah so of course i

1059
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,320
mean this is

1060
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,040
the thing to do if you want to make a

1061
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,839
like a

1062
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,800
super stable rock solid um measurement

1063
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,799
device

1064
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,240
um but it is really expensive i mean

1065
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,960
this we are looking here at 15 euros

1066
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,399
and yeah that's the reason to have this

1067
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,520
separate sound card

1068
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:06,720
just to enable um with very low

1069
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,000
resources to do this but i'm looking for

1070
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,200
these pulses yeah

1071
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,960
so this common mode rejection is a

1072
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,399
problem and also this

1073
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,480
is kind of um uber schwinger i'm missing

1074
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,079
the english terminal

1075
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,680
um yeah there's this kind of

1076
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,560
oscillations here

1077
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,399
um if you design a specific analog to a

1078
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,160
digital conversion of course

1079
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,520
you would take all of that into account

1080
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,920
and it wouldn't happen but

1081
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,680
here this happens because the circuit

1082
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,000
can never be exactly

1083
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,879
optimal for a certain sound card input

1084
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,040
it will always

1085
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,040
be some mismatch of impedances and

1086
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,480
all right so maybe these special

1087
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,960
technical issues and details this could

1088
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,720
be something you could discuss with

1089
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:58,319
oliver on on twitter baby oliver you

1090
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,640
want to join the irc room

1091
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:02,800
for your talk as well people were very

1092
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,640
engaged wearing your talk so this is

1093
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,240
always a good sign

1094
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:11,200
in um in that sense i'd say

1095
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,680
um thank you for for being part of this

1096
