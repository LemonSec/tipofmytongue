perspective it was a relatively

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,199
quiet year but

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,359
it couldn't have been more hectic from

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,839
the

7

will now talk to you about what it was

like

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,280
and about anything that was important

13
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,520
i'm happy to announce the weather report

netpolitik.org hi

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,559
welcome to the weather report by

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,680
netspolitik.org

18
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,960
it's a bit uncommon for me

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:13,840
to speak to so few people in front of

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,839
the camera

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,320
we'll have to get through it i hope that

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,680
we'll be seeing in person next year

23
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,119
and have many fascinating moments

24
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,880
together one of the top topics

25
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,200
this year was eu ministers want to

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,560
create back doors in digital

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,920
communications the

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,759
german interior ministry

29
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:46,320
used the german eo council presidency

30
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,320
to get some resolutions ahead

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,840
the problem with that and

32
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,840
these are the buttons

33
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,560
we'll have to keep our eyes open because

34
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,480
this is a

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:23,840
page that is very relevant to our

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:23,839
communication but there's a new debate

37
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,839
that this was like a medium

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,640
peak within a five-year campaign that

39
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,800
took place

40
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,879
between closed behind closed door

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,879
a

42
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,200
had a resolution that it is also

43
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,799
legal for the german federal office for

44
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,040
the protection of the constitution to

45
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,040
use

46
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,920
our security authorities are buying

states

48
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,839
trojans from tax money

49
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:31,680
so our devices are all vulnerable

50
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,480
and i.t insecurity is being created

51
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,560
but there are good news

52
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,560

the finfisher headquarters in munich

have been raided by the police

55
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,120

with other organizations

57
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:02,080
and ngos because finn fisher exported

63
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:24,400
because alexa witnessed a murder

this year the interior ministry

65
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,198
for the homeland ministry as hostile

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:53,919
a slap in the face to anyone who wanted

to join the debate any ngos or

69
00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:00,799
citizens who would have

70
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,479
liked to have a look at the law before

71
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:08,840
it's published so there's a lot of

72
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:11,840
criticism on the i.t security law

[Music]

75
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:31,360
the german ministry for i.t

76
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:34,639
security could extend their power

77
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:39,840
they would be allowed to hack

78
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,840
to look into your data traffic

79
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,840
but on the other hand they weren't very

successful

um

87
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,360
so um they are in quite a hurry

88
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,639
and we will have to wait for the process

89
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:49,840
before

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,840
the constitutional court in 2020

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,840
at least if you're in the german

sourland

93
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,638
you can you are faster with a voice if

94
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,599
you want to transport data than with the

95
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,599
public internet

96
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,840
that has to do with the

97
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,520
failure of establishing a broadband

98
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,479
infrastructure

99
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,479
to its purpose

100
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,520
managed to have to extend their powers

101
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,400
in so many ways but they didn't manage

102
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,599
to

103
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,599
create a viable infrastructure

104
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,560
are expecting to have progress in 2025

105
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,120
so there's hope for anyone who still has

106
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,240
to use

107
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,240
their landline

108
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,039
right

109
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,879
in the free market economy

110
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:24,639
here surveillance would make more sense

111
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,919
for a change police officers

112
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:31,680
were able to access contact

113
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,680
data of journalists

114
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:39,039
there's a podcast by edilbaider

together with constanza courts because

been affected by the nsu

national socialist underground 2.0

118
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,839
where police officers accessed personal

data from activists

[Music]

121
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,839
the activism

122
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,760
another very dominating topic this year

123
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:31,360
the extradition of julian assange to

124
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,360
the u.s because of his wikileaks

125
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,720
2010 revelations

126
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:42,479
on 4th january 2021

127
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:46,720
we are expecting a decision and

128
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,720
this is still a political process

129
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,839
there will not be a fair process

130
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,680
the lesson is going to be don't mess

131
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,680
with the us

132
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,480
therefore solidarity with assange

133
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,399
solidarity

134
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:20,160
with wikileaks and hoping

135
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:24,000
it's not going to be as bad

136
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:27,920
what we need to do then we

137
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,440
still used the opportunity to protest

138
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:35,199
against the eu copyright

139
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,480
law reform and everything is getting

140
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,760
worse and worse but that's what we

141
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,959
expected

142
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:47,839
upload filters are going to come

143
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,839
even though they said they wouldn't

144
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,560
we can trust in our eu government

145
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,560
to make a good

146
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,880
so deal forms of

147
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,200
copyrighted information could can still

148
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,519
be distributed such as memes for

149
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,839
examples but

150
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,839
it looks like that is going to

151
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
stop

152
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,839
deals with the topics

153
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,040
but we will have problems here because

154
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,839
we can't protest

155
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,719
the way we would want to talking about

156
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,720
the music

157
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:52,000
industry music industry is using

158
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:56,959
open source products and

159
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,959
tools to use tool

160
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,839
and this is why they had to stop their

161
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,839
services

162
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:22,560
the source code is back off youtube dl

163
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:25,279
and it has effects on germany because

164
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,479
many hosters and other projects were

165
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,279
affected

166
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,320
so this is a dangerous development we're

167
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,279
seeing here

168
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,279
we thought that the age of copyright

169
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:39,120
laws was over but the industry

170
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,120
is rearing its ugly

171
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:47,680
a very bad topic last year

172
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,880
was the eu um resolution against terror

173
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,000
propaganda

174
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,200
where we have established where um

175
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,399
a trial was established and

176
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:02,800
a resolution was found

177
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,800
and it's not as apocalyptic

178
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,639
so there will not be mandatory upload

179
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,639
filters

180
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:21,839
the um general problem remains

181
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,839
we have no democratic control

182
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,719
of what is in those terra propaganda

183
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,920
databases and

184
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,279
we still don't know what terra

185
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,040
propaganda is

186
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,079
supposed to be because it isn't clearly

187
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,399
defined

188
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,319
and it's being interpreted and different

189
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,760
in different ways

190
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,920
for example what is considered by

191
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,120
hungary as terror propaganda could also

192
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,479
be called

193
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,480
human rights activism

194
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,880
and now countries are having it easier

195
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,079
to declare that

196
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,079
terror propaganda

197
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:07,199
and also in northwind failure

198
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:11,600
in germany activists are being affected

199
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,599
because they're labeled as terrorists

200
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,760
and that gives politicians and

201
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,199
institutions

202
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,160
the opportunity to

203
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,160
cancel protests

204
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,800
people from protesting

[Music]

206
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,319
even though the law says freedom of

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,360
expression

208
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,920
is not up for debate

209
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,920
but still

210
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:45,839
we'll see what's coming

211
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
from

basically um basically

215
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:10,959
restrict porn some porn sites

216
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,079

actually

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,959
have senior required registration to

youth people can't actually use it and a

221
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,760
couple of years ago

222
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,199
we actually we as a society actually

223
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,360
developed

224
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:32,399
ideas which was deleting instead of

225
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,279
blocking access but this time we don't

226
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,759
really have

227
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,759
a debate and we don't really have good

228
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,800
alternatives that we can show them

229
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:44,000
to make sure that we will not have these

230
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,560
barriers otherwise we might have these

231
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,199
barriers they might not even

232
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,599
be included within a law but instead

233
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,719
just

234
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,440
a basically a directive

235
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,000
from the administration 2020 there was

236
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,480
also

237
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,199
a coup against um demonstrations

238
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,320
there was a little bit of a reveal

239
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,000
against the

240
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,600
global security operations center

241
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,759
which is basically a surveillance

242
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,639
apparatus within amazon

243
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,839
that looked at climate activists whether

244
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,120
they want to

245
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:22,240
start boycotts against amazon

246
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,040
but they're also looking at um

247
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,560
labor unions and protesting unions and

248
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,759
they know for example that

249
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:33,199
in leipzig there were quite a few

250
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:36,160
amazon workers that actually did

251
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,319
participate in this strike but no people

252
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,519
on the higher levels of the ladder

253
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,959
and we asked amazon and there was a

254
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,959
and there's a nice quote of them

255
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,600
watching there was never

256
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,599
actually an observation of the activity

257
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,880
through operative that is people that

258
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,839
are actually

259
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,240
working there right now so we are quite

260
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,440
sure

261
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,599
that they didn't actually have

262
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,559
workers work there but they definitely

263
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,760
know who

264
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,799
was on strike so 2020 and

265
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,700
was the year where we decided that 2021

266
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:18,858
we needed to have fingerprints on

267
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,859
[Music]

268
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:24,400
so if you don't have a new national id

269
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,240
if you don't want your fingerprints

270
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,600
in databases that you probably can't

271
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,080
delete it at any point

272
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,039
you can do that until december so get

273
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,199
your own

274
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,200
personal id until december in germany

275
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,799
someone called financial said it's quite

276
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,719
expensive it might be a little bit

277
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,840
expensive

278
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,240
so if you want to keep your fingerprints

279
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,600
you

280
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,520
have to spend some money basically no

281
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,439
remember that's high type of spoilers

282
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,799
you go to sort of

283
00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:00,960
mixed weather this year

284
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,960
the conservative elite

285
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,039
what kind of competencies many important

286
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,720
people had

287
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,720
there was theodore gutenberg

288
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:19,280
she basically chose the right horse

289
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:23,039
augustus intelligence and also

290
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:27,918
wirecard and he basically was very well

291
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,919
and he really understands innovative

292
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,880
or at least burn a lot of money of other

293
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,320
people obviously

294
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:41,520
and 2020 was also the year where we

295
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,559
first tested whether our catastrophe

296
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,480
alarm systems work and

297
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,559
it's good that we test it it didn't work

298
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,400
obviously sometimes we use

299
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:56,080
the wrong technology sometimes

300
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,960
processes didn't work because some

301
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,320
alarms were kind of blocking each other

302
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,840
were overlapping

303
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:07,200
yeah so if we had the zombie akapolix um

304
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,280
well i'll be that basically maybe next

305
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,320
time it'll be better

306
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,760
2020 was also the year where we

307
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,960
thought that at least one positive thing

308
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,640
would be coming from

309
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:24,000
corona which would be that masks protect

310
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,039
from surveillance that's what

311
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,799
we hoped anyway in summer but

312
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:32,320
by now all of these machine learning

313
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,320
algorithms have been trained

314
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,080
your mask still helps against

315
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,520
recognition against facial recognition

316
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:45,120
but it's not very clear whether

317
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,760
all the systems aren't able to recognize

318
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,600
people with masks or whether you should

319
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,240
probably think that

320
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,760
some systems will recognize you so maybe

321
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,440
put in some makeup

322
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:01,120
2020 was also the year where a

323
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:04,159
polish firm a polish company had a

324
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,158
facial recognition facial recognition

325
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,760
database that you could basically

326
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:13,919
search through um eyes

327
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:16,640
showed that every picture anyone

328
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,919
leaves on the internet can basically be

329
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,840
used by all of these

330
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,679
companies and these companies won't even

331
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,600
ask you for your pictures

332
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:28,640
to basically um have their databases

333
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,639
and there were some positives

334
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,559
developments there's a moratorium that

335
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,240
is

336
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:40,240
some firms like ibm amazon microsoft

337
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:43,039
will not be selling facial recognition

338
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,000
data to security services like the

339
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,120
police

340
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,120
ibm seems to

341
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,280
he be to go further in terms of talk at

342
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,799
least

343
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,039
we need to see what the reality is

344
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,400
but of course we need to see what the

345
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,240
reality will show

346
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,679
whether people will act whether these

347
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,600
firms will actually do this

348
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,679
but we can see that at least there's a

349
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,439
debate in the u.s right now

350
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:13,679
around facial recognition systems

351
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:17,840
and the bias problems that these systems

352
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,840
are inherently

353
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,640
sorry is to ban automatic facial

354
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,360
recognition systems

355
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,360
in public spaces in the eu but we're

356
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,559
actually seeing that these public that

357
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,439
these automatic fashion

358
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,840
recognition systems are being rolled out

359
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,840
more and more

360
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
2020

361
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,559
you might be able to get rid of a um

362
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,520
[Music]

363
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,520
data protection

364
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:11,440
so basically privacy shield

365
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:14,559
was forbidden by the

366
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,280
european court and it's still not

367
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,320
allowed

368
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,678
because the us can

369
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,960
not or will not

370
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,000
will not make sure that their security

371
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,120
services do not

372
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,280
use our data so we cannot

373
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,280
send our data to the us

374
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,719
of course the problem is still kind of

375
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,000
there

376
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,880
because um rights

377
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,520
still aren't used within still aren't

378
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,360
protected

379
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,840
within the eu so the decision was kind

380
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,918
of

381
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,639
well strange but that's something that

382
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,640
still needs to be

383
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,799
changed

384
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,919
advertisement industry has managed to

385
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:06,158
make sure that there will not be better

386
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:08,320
protection of user data and privacy

387
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,200
so all of these dark patterns that we

388
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,120
see

389
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,520
where you have to go to all of these

390
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,520
websites and basically

391
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,639
say well i don't want these cookies i

392
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,879
don't want these cookies

393
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,919
and all of this is like due to a

394
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,360
regulation from five years ago but

395
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,919
um the implementation is kind of lacking

396
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,399
so

397
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,039
we still haven't done this and that's

398
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,840
why

399
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,559
you could call it the be r which is the

400
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,199
german

401
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,039
airport that has been delayed for years

402
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,400
and years of nets politics of internet

403
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,559
politics

404
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,559
okay

405
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,000
more like ambiguous whether we think

406
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,039
that

407
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
this law is good or bad because we there

408
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,120
should be a put

409
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,919
back possibility so users should have a

410
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,039
better

411
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:03,919
chance of um

412
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:06,480
making sure that you can't be deleted

413
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:09,200
your content can't be deleted completely

414
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,919
if you don't want to but the federal

415
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,039
government

416
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,760
decided that all of the directors

417
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,039
everything that might be against the law

418
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,640
will be

419
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,840
sent over to the federal government or

420
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,200
the police

421
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,559
so there might have been a huge database

422
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:33,840
but yeah the federal the german federal

423
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,840
president has

424
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,760
a couple of laws at different levels

425
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,080
especially at the eu level there is the

426
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,679
um

427
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,678
digital services package

428
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,678
had its first peak in december 2020

429
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,959
the digital services package and the

430
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:05,200
digital market

431
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:08,880
law no less than

432
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:12,559
sort of like a huge new law

433
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:15,279
does the eu commission want to make

434
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,158
and on the one side this is about

435
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:20,240
controlling

436
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:22,720
the market power of large

437
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,520
platforms like facebook and google but

438
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,440
it's also

439
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,200
about content moderation and all of

440
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,840
these debates that we currently

441
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,880
that we've had for years and years

442
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,959
there's the questions

443
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:39,760
of the identity how can we

444
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:42,400
of inter opera operability can we um

445
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,120
can we transmit messages from signal to

446
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,159
whatsapp

447
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,799
should we have backdoors in there how

448
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,919
about

449
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,000
researchers and regulation

450
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,919
administrations that want to actually

451
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,039
get this data how can they get data

452
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,919
because currently

453
00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:00,240
all of these big firms have access have

454
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,240
exclusive access to their data

455
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,080
and all of these research and they have

456
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,799
their own research departments that can

457
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,960
basically

458
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:10,879
in real time see what will happen

459
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,559
and what is good and what is bad and no

460
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,400
one can actually control what they're

461
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,639
doing

462
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,679
and all of these things are part of this

463
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,240
law it's

464
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,360
about algorithmic transparency and

465
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,440
control

466
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,039
it's about what rules should there be

467
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,000
within the internet

468
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,200
in the next 20 25 years because that's

469
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,640
supposed to be a

470
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,320
reform of e-commerce of an e-commerce

471
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,480
law of 2001.

472
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,840
back then google was very very small

473
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,120
facebook hasn't really existed

474
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,678
anymore and amazon only sold books

475
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,080
now the world is really different and

476
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,279
this is not only about platforms

477
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,399
but it's about hibernates almost half of

478
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,960
the internet

479
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,960
it's also

480
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,200
the only thing that isn't really in

481
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,559
there is who

482
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,640
is responsible in a legal sense

483
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,000
and 2020 there was also a renaissance of

484
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,640
something that we hoped

485
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,039
was dead already the comeback of the

486
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,600
year

487
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:14,240
the fax machine unfortunately that's

488
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,360
that shows how the german health system

489
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,840
works

490
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,000
and this is um not very good

491
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,918
independence

492
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,679
but let's be true let's be honest

493
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,760
without facts devices

494
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,039
we would basically be screwed in germany

495
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,480
let's see whether we have

496
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:33,600
an improvement there one thing that

497
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,080
the digital civil society actually did

498
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,279
was the coroner warn app

499
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:42,320
you can criticize it back and forth

500
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:45,679
but there's no other country where

501
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,799
more people use it most of the critique

502
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:53,760
is a little bit is not very qualified

503
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,760
we were able to make sure

504
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:01,439
we do not have a surveillance apparatus

505
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:03,360
that we built for

506
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,880
contract tracing which actually wouldn't

507
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,520
have helped most likely

508
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,520
but which would have made more

509
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,559
surveillance for all of us

510
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,840
even today there's no day where old

511
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,600
white men

512
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:20,080
are talking about data security as the

513
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,080
reason for the pandemic

514
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,360
but i actually know many different

515
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,960
reasons that are much

516
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,840
much more logical and much more true

517
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,240
there's one there's a couple more

518
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,000
problems

519
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,840
they didn't really understand open

520
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,520
source for example it's nice that we

521
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,559
have an app that's open source

522
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:42,480
but open source also use means

523
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:45,360
that an app is developed more and more

524
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,360
with the community

525
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,080
the app was presented well in summer

526
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,399
everyone thought well we don't have

527
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,600
the pandemic is over we don't need to

528
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,279
develop it further

529
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,799
and then suddenly we had this second

530
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,399
wave and there's

531
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,240
lots of updates and lots of things

532
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,080
happening but

533
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,320
we're still missing some stuff like

534
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:10,320
cluster recognition

535
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,840
we don't really have a contact diary

536
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,600
and we still need to make sure that they

537
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,879
don't include more

538
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:20,000
surveillance and there's problems that

539
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:23,120
not all of the labs are

540
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,760
part of this system sometimes your test

541
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,840
results

542
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,840
need a week

543
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,200
it's also difficult to make sure that it

544
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,279
was also very difficult

545
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,279
to make sure that we get to the latest

546
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,000
version of the google and apple are

547
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,120
piece

548
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,320
and this bad communication leads to

549
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:50,000
less trust and less

550
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:53,279
acceptance of this app and these are all

551
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,919
problems that we might be able to

552
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,440
that we might be able to solve but we

553
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,240
wouldn't even need this app

554
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,440
if we actually had made if we actually

555
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,880
had

556
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,880
prepared in the right way

557
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,840
has also led to

558
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,678
you know in the past when we could go to

559
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,959
bars and restaurants

560
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,760
if you wanted to you basically put down

561
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,159
your names

562
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,840
and your addresses but you obviously

563
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,559
didn't put your real names

564
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,918
because there was no there was not much

565
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,158
data privacy there

566
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,919
and one of the big problems was and is

567
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,840
that the police actually used

568
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,840
this these lists to

569
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,159
and here the government could have made

570
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,440
more accept could have made more

571
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,039
acceptance

572
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:56,320
and then something else what was kind of

573
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:59,120
sweet last year was really really very

574
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,480
a lot more serious this year because um

575
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,840
some people

576
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,080
basically used these mechanisms of the

577
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,799
platforms

578
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,840
people that we would have explained well

579
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,158
you're crazy

580
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,279
so we had to explain to our families and

581
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,039
to our parents

582
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,440
that you shouldn't trust everything you

583
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:20,720
can see on whatsapp or on facebook

584
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,360
that was um forward to you 2020 was also

585
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,159
the year

586
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,600
that we found that we had to find out

587
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,399
and

588
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,519
research a lot more about conspiracy

589
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,678
theories

590
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,559
we still don't know how much money some

591
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,080
conspiracy

592
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,678
theorists have gotten but we understood

593
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,199
the system and now we're hoping to

594
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,120
become rich this time around

595
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,840
and it's unbelievable what kind of

596
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,840
people there are around

597
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,158
found that out this time around 2020 was

598
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,240
the year

599
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:22,880
that we basically looked that we saw

600
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,840
what really happened in digitalization

601
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,919
of the

602
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,639
education system in germany where did

603
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,120
all of the money go many

604
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,960
parents and students are still

605
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,320
traumatized from the experiences during

606
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,919
the first lockdown

607
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:41,360
where pdfs

608
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,360
basically had to

609
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,440
had to print out pdf documents and then

610
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,519
scan them back

611
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:53,120
and really didn't hear anything

612
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,120
after scan printing and scanning

613
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,519
and they're all really excited for the

614
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,159
next lockdown at the beginning of

615
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,240
january

616
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,679
maybe at the end of the pandemic we will

617
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,799
actually have

618
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,840
real digitalization within the within

619
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:11,120
our schools

620
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:13,199
let's come to more positive topics

621
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,080
even though the digitalization of the

622
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:20,240
year education system isn't

623
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,240
working out quite as we expected

624
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,840
our students need the appropriate

625
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,840
devices and formats

626
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:33,199
we have still seen that many people

627
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:37,279
really put themselves out there to

628
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,279
make platforms available

629
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:45,519
aren't so thank you very much

630
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:49,760
for those who build platforms

631
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:52,960
universities schools cyber for edu

632
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:58,000
and other organizations you saved us

633
00:33:52,960 --> 00:34:02,720
all and you helped us find alternatives

634
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,720
against the data capitalist

635
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:11,520
it's very nice to see that there are

636
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:15,359
alternatives but it was also nice to see

637
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:20,000
that the digital's civil society was

638
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:20,000
very helpful at a point where politics

639
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,720
and where it became apparent that we

640
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,440
don't have enough

641
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,078
protection equipment such as masks and

642
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,918
face

643
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:35,839
shields so people

644
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,839
took it into their own hands

645
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,679
knitting templates

646
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,639
i love it

647
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,800
also have direct twitter messages

648
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,659
[Music]

649
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,160
which means losing donation

650
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:52,079
advantages there are some

651
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,078
funny aspects

652
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,880
the demonstration or protest seen for

653
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,920
the uh has been nominated

654
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:05,599
as a candidate for

655
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,599
world cultural heritage

656
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,839
that is well deserved

657
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,839
in 2020

658
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:25,119
were more open towards creative

659
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:28,160
commons licenses zf did a better job

660
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:32,320
admittedly but there's still a lot of

661
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,319
room for improvement

662
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:45,279
and we hope that we will be seeing

663
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:48,799
more progress and more open

664
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,440
licenses because after all we paid for

665
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:55,040
it

666
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,040
in 2020 um the team

667
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,759
they didn't have concerts unfortunately

668
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,400
i'm hoping for

669
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,599
more content i don't know if they're in

670
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,480
the

671
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,359
if they can match the um congress

672
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,760
program

673
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,720
but still system abstracts worth a

674
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,240
listen

675
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:19,279
that was it for the sis um the

676
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:23,200
net politic weather report our motto

677
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:25,760
never give up never done so in the past

678
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,879
20 30 years and we won't in the next 20

679
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,079
30 years

680
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,079
if we stick together

681
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,240
fight for our rights we have the

682
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,359
opportunity to

683
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,759
make for a better digital society

684
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,960
so fight for your digital rights thank

685
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,000

691
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,920
i'm back we had a bit of

692
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,240
technical technical difficulties at the

693
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,400
beginning of the presentation sorry for

694
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,598
that

695
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,599
for anyone who's still watching

696
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,040
it it wasn't

697
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:35,200
people are trying to fix this

698
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,040
so until then we still have a few

699
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,200
minutes until the next

700
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:43,359
talk to have um a q and a session

701
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:47,520
marcos becadel is here in the stream and

702
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:50,960
he's ready for your questions

703
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:53,200
we don't have that many questions

704
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,680
yet maybe because it was difficult to

705
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,359
follow the presentation

706
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:02,879
but no worries it will be

707
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:05,759
uploaded to ourmedia.cc.e

708
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,560
where you can listen to it later please

709
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,599
leave your

710
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,190
questions and comments on irc and on

711
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,260
twitter using the corresponding

712
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,260
[Music]

713
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,480
and the signal angels will gather your

714
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,960
questions

715
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,440
and i will be able to read them out

716
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,440
marcus

717
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:33,440
would you give us a short

718
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:36,960
look ahead at the coming months

719
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,400
yes one big thing in the next couple of

720
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,520
years is of course that

721
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,480
the covet pandemic will still continue

722
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,120
like on the side the federal government

723
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,560
has

724
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,720
[Music]

725
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,040
made a couple of laws in the last couple

726
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:57,839
of weeks the telecommunications law

727
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,839
the i.t security law the bnd law

728
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:13,200
to hopefully be actually enacted

729
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,520
before the election and exactly in april

730
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,040
may

731
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:19,359
june everyone can

732
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,319
everyone can go meet people and go

733
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,240
inside and stuff

734
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:24,240
and they probably won't be interested in

735
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,839
all of these digital issues anymore

736
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,598
i don't really believe that we'll be

737
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:30,319
able to change something

738
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,720
on a big scale scale because all of

739
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:34,079
these

740
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,160
surveillance stuff is in these laws

741
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,400
but we're still trying to change

742
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:42,078
something to mobilize people

743
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,560
to get involved to

744
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,599
make sure that all of these topics will

745
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,839
be

746
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,440
even relevant for the election and then

747
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,640
we're hoping that after this

748
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,000
election we will have

749
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:59,200
no large coalition because

750
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,280
in the past the large coalitions based

751
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:06,560
on cdu csu and spd have really

752
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,560
not made

753
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,759
good decisions with regards to

754
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,759
surveillance

755
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,319
thank you for that

756
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,040
especially looking at the eit security

757
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,839
law

758
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,800
what are is the criticism that we need

759
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:28,240
to be

760
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,119
pay special attention to what we need to

761
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,319
contact

762
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:36,319
members of the parliament about

763
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,319
maybe one or two or three key points

764
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,400
so for me

765
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:47,759
i've really bce overall

766
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,680
i have i'm i'm not really sure how i

767
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,680
think i think the bse

768
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,960
is very good which is the information

769
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,598
security um

770
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,240
office in germany and i think it's good

771
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,000
that we actually have this

772
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,439
and there's technical people in there

773
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,800
but the problem in there it's

774
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,000
it's not it's not independent so um

775
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,200
the ministry of interior can tell it

776
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,319
what to do

777
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,319
and it actually is within all of these

778
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:19,599
security

779
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,000
administration it really wants to be in

780
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,119
this

781
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,359
security administration and this kind of

782
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:29,359
makes

783
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:32,319
the acceptance of the bse not as easy

784
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:33,440
so i wanted to be independent i want to

785
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,079
make sure

786
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,960
i want to know that if they find a

787
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,160
loophole

788
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,160
they will actually close it

789
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,960
but because the ministry of that the

790
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,480
ministry of interior cannot just tell it

791
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,599
well no please don't close this loophole

792
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,599
we want to use it

793
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,720
and we actually have a

794
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,720
passage in the

795
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:08,560
to contact um security authorities

796
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,560
before he can

797
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,928
fix security gaps

798
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,929
[Music]

799
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,000
basically one of two basic laws that the

800
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,920
constitution that the constitutional

801
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,440
court has actually made

802
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,920
but the federal government actually

803
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,160
ignores this basic law

804
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,480
and the federal government doesn't

805
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,640
really protect it

806
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,079
even though many people talk about

807
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,440
sovereignty

808
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:06,160
the basic law of on

809
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:09,040
integrity and privacy isn't really

810
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,598
it should have should be defended and

811
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,960
currently

812
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:15,040
that's not the case and as long as this

813
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,920
is not the case it's just a sad

814
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,920
state of affairs

815
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,839
yeah i can agree more anyway

816
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,598
threatened by ite security laws but also

817
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,640
the telecommunication act

818
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:43,720
and there is a um

819
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,720
very large amendment to that

820
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,720
telecommunications

821
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,640
what impacts do you see from that

822
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,119
well the telecommunications law is

823
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,119
really

824
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,720
something difficult there's lots of

825
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,720
lobbyists

826
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,799
that are looking at this very

827
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,200
intensively but there's not really a lot

828
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,400
of

829
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,640
independent people actually

830
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,000
reading this and that are willing to

831
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,400
read this

832
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,920
and at netpolitik.org we're really happy

833
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,960
that we have thomas ruder

834
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:22,960
who actually enjoys reading this

835
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:26,800
at least sometimes he basically finds

836
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,050
all of the parts that no one finds

837
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,920
because there's like um

838
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:32,640
[Music]

839
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,960
something where like you can actually

840
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,839
get

841
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,040
data you can ask for data and no one

842
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,799
talks about this

843
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:43,119
um actually collecting and storing data

844
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,359
just for the future no one talks about

845
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:49,119
this so we're really hoping that

846
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:51,359
the um constitutional court will

847
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,680
make this illegal and it's also about

848
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,100
messenger services like telegram

849
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,040
um

850
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:59,839
[Music]

851
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,520
and we're hoping that this will be and

852
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:02,000
they are hoping that they can regulate

853
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,520
them

854
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,599
to make back doors in there and it's a

855
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:12,319
really big hurdle for us

856
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:15,040
to have these messengers

857
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,920
like telegram that are sometimes

858
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,599
somewhere between

859
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,079
platform and sms and that we can find

860
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,280
a new form of regulation in there and

861
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,839
they might actually be able

862
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,359
they might actually destroy this current

863
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:30,560
system and just

864
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:32,880
include much more civilians

865
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,880
right

866
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:41,359
the state of affairs is bad in 2019

867
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:45,920
i was slightly looking forward to

868
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:51,440
the constitutional court um

869
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,440
prohibiting a secret services act

870
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,839
sadly

871
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:11,839
[Music]

872
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:11,839
surveillance and control mechanisms

873
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:26,880
enacted by the ministers right now

874
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,119
is i think it's actually not

875
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:32,000
constitutional but the problem is that

876
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,200
even that we won't find this out until

877
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,880
five to eight years

878
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,640
when the constitutional court is

879
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,119
actually up to date because there's

880
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,400
still

881
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:42,960
um laws from the last government

882
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,880
that they're still debating on and one

883
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:48,079
of the big problems with the b d

884
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,079
law is that

885
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:54,880
that we as germans are really

886
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:58,160
a developing country in this

887
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:01,520
terms in terms of having control of

888
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,399
our secret service and this is what we

889
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,359
want

890
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,160
officially they have like all of these

891
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:10,480
controls

892
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,480
don't have enough people and

893
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,359
the secret service has actually gotten

894
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,680
more

895
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:21,558
budget and they have the allowance to

896
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:25,118
they're allowed to hack some

897
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:25,119
telecommunications networks

898
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:32,319
and the federal government strangely

899
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,319
thinks that

900
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:40,000
thinks that they basically did what the

901
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:43,359
constitutional court wanted if the bnd

902
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,800
can only do very little but you can only

903
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:47,680
do 10 or 20

904
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,680
of the um

905
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,359
obviously they won't be able to hack 30

906
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,880
of worldwide traffic

907
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:06,000
but actually they that means they can

908
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,000
hack whatever they want

909
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:14,400
of course it would be great

910
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:17,119
if they could pack and survey everything

911
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,240
but that's one of those sort of like

912
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:21,680
cheap

913
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,399
rappers well it's really limited their

914
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,480
surveillance

915
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,160
capabilities to 30 percent but in

916
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,160
actuality they can survey whatever they

917
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:32,160
want

918
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:35,359
i have another statement

919
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,000
which i can only agree to you uh thank

920
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:40,640
you

921
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:45,839
very much for your efforts

922
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:45,839
your continuous efforts to document

923
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,599
i think i can say that on behalf of

924
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,440
everyone

925
00:49:53,599 --> 00:50:00,319
who is listening thank you for listening

926
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,920
and if you're still listening you still

927
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,800
have the opportunity to

928
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,280
ask questions on twitter and other

929
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,280
channels

930
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:17,118
post it to rc2 which is

931
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:20,240
uh the room where in here

932
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,880
and i'll be able to read them out until

933
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:27,279
then

934
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:30,720
marcus i would like to know

935
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,720
what do you think about the service act

936
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:38,000
so the digital services act the package

937
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,440
will most likely be the biggest lobby

938
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,359
war

939
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:46,480
of the internet policy history

940
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:48,319
which is basically about um making the

941
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,440
rules and conditions

942
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:54,160
for all of these platforms

943
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,920
within the eu and to basically reform

944
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:59,359
all of these rules and to

945
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:02,800
find ways to curb

946
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:07,119
the market power of large

947
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:10,319
tech giants i think what we've seen

948
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:13,440
at the beginning of right before

949
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:16,480
christmas it's interesting

950
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:20,800
but there's not enough focus on

951
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:24,480
basic laws on human rights

952
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:28,160
there's more of a of an economic

953
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,040
liberal economic approach that we don't

954
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,160
actually want

955
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:34,160
to make these we don't actually want to

956
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,240
destroy these large firms

957
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,520
but it's that we want to ensure that

958
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,720
there's some competition

959
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:44,060
so it would be nice if we were able to

960
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:46,640
have clear rules

961
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:48,960
[Music]

962
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,078
to have clear rules to basically

963
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,800
destroyed these

964
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,520
large conglomerates like facebook google

965
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,520
what

966
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,200
and stuff if you look at facebook

967
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,640
facebook they actually bought

968
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:02,558
whatsapp instagram with basically saying

969
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,240
well we're not actually bringing all of

970
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,520
these data together but obviously

971
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,759
they're doing it right now

972
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:11,599
just to make sure that they are not

973
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,599
destroyed at a further point

974
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,000
i think the eu commission should just

975
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,040
destroy them because they

976
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,400
did not keep their promises they were

977
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,400
only allowed to

978
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,839
make these mergers because they promised

979
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,839
not to collect all this data

980
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:34,799
all of these google is a similar example

981
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,559
that is permeating a lot of different

982
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,319
markets and basically

983
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,760
bringing all of it together and has of

984
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:42,240
this market power

985
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,319
and because of this market power it can

986
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:47,919
actually discover new markets

987
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:51,359
and we need clear rules for that

988
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,400
or against that and we need regulation

989
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,720
agencies

990
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,680
that are able to that have enough

991
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,200
personnel

992
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:00,720
that have enough personnel that is

993
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:03,919
actually technically qualified that can

994
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:07,359
actually talk with these tech giants um

995
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:09,599
at their level thank you just one

996
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:11,598
quick note to our spectators i don't

997
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:14,319
know if you can see me or hear me

998
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,680
if this stream is still on or if there

999
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:18,720
are difficulties

1000
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:21,680
there's a there's swimmers of a ddos

1001
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,520
attack against our infrastructure so if

1002
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:26,399
you can hear me

1003
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,280
if you can't hear me don't worry it's

1004
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:32,800
recorded

1005
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,800
it will be uploaded to media.ccc.org

1006

[Music]

1007
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,880
and i've just been notified that

1008
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:46,399
recording

1009
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:50,319
has worked out perfectly so you can

1010
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:53,599
listen to the talk again one of the last

1011
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,599
questions for today

1012
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,800
what do you

1013
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,259
how could we get more participation

1014
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,839
there

1015
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:26,000
[Laughter]

1016
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:29,440
laughing the ministry for interior

1017
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:33,119
basically had

1018
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:36,400
four needed four tries to get this um

1019
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:39,839
law through parliament so one thing

1020
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:43,280
that would be helpful would be to

1021
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:46,880
have all of these law

1022
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:49,839
draw out of these drafts of laws

1023
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,520
published in the on the internet because

1024
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,720
they're already out there to lobbyists

1025
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,079
and currently it's us

1026
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:57,598
doing it so it would be nice if the

1027
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,440
interior ministry would actually pay

1028
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,359
someone to do this

1029
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,680
and then it would be good if we had

1030
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:05,279
longer deliberation times longer times

1031
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:08,640
to reply to

1032
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:11,599
um to deliberate there

1033
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,598
and then so that we know and then to

1034
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:16,640
have a more transparent process

1035
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:19,920
so we know which lobbyists had

1036
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,118
what effect and when did when did the

1037
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,920
lobbyists when were the

1038
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:25,040
lobbyists involved at which point i

1039
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,000
think the

1040
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,720
um large coalition the current german

1041
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,480
government

1042
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:35,520
had this in their coalition

1043
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,640
agreement but actually we haven't seen

1044
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:39,759
it at all

1045
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:42,000
it's possible and it would be very

1046
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,520
it would be easy to have this um i.t

1047
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,760
security law

1048
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:50,799
which is also which is only about

1049
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:54,079
5g where we found a um

1050
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:56,079
sort of compromise that makes it very

1051
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,400
very

1052
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,200
unimportant whether it's huawei but the

1053
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,680
topic is

1054
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,960
a lot more relevant a lot more important

1055
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,160
and we should have

1056
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:08,000
more and we should have more media

1057
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,759
coverage of all of these other aspects

1058
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,599
as well

1059
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,280
because our system is very broken so

1060
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:17,839
we'll have a lot more problems in the

1061
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,839
future most likely

1062
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,640
are very important and necessary

1063
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,040
with this government it's not possible

1064
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,520
thank you let's come to our last

1065
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,520
question

1066
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,119
filed

1067
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:52,060
[Music]

1068
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:57,040
if it's possible in two minutes or is it

1069
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:57,040
too much

1070
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:02,799
yes i would need to read up on that

1071
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:05,200
because there's some a lot of it has

1072
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:08,480
happened in the last couple of

1073
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:10,879
days what i can say is that

1074
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:13,520
we are currently in court with many of

1075
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:16,079
them and then you need to wait whether

1076
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:18,480
the court actually accepts your lawsuit

1077
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:21,440
and then it takes a long time

1078
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,240
until it's actually decided now as

1079
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:28,319
you've said

1080
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:31,919
we have a number of um laws in the past

1081
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:35,279
um that are still where we actually

1082
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,079
have filed a suit and they're still not

1083
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,960
just discussed

1084
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:40,000
despite them being five years older and

1085
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,200
within this pandemic

1086
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,160
obviously there's even more problems and

1087
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,200
i don't think it's possible to actually

1088
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,558
file this

1089
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:55,839
quickly okay thank you very much

1090
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:55,839
we'll take that impetus

1091
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,280
different police laws and lawsuits

1092
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:09,839
against it

1093
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:09,839
to document that

1094
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,598
thank you for listening you can donate

1095
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,640
to us

1096
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:29,599
if you want the more money or

1097
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:32,400
donations we receive the more actions we

1098
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:32,400
can carry out

1099
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:40,640
because the growing digital society

1100
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:44,558
is being not treated

1101
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:51,839
with the attention

1102
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:51,839
by politics

1103
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,839
eyes on that

1104
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:20,959
