[Music]

45
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,519
of commands that they can use and

46
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,600
there's three main commands

47
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,600
um

48
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,399
information in the table here in the

perspective of this uh foreign

52
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,360
pros and cons of decision-making point

53
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:11,439
is often down to what

54
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:11,440
what is

55
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,839
so you can see there's a distribution

56
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,839
and there are choices

57
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,839

[Music]

59
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,760
slightly different things the same

60
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,920
sources again from the same sources then

61
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,120
we saw a third then we saw a series of

62
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,279
information harvesting

63
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,279
again from the united kingdom

64
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,839
and then finally

65
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,839
so

66
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,279
relatively quick between all five in

67
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,959
this particular case

68
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,959
the attacker was in there

69
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,040
as wives in a hurry and the actual

70
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,839
target well

71
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,839
this is actually

72
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:18,079
was to see if the number existed

73
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:23,439
so this is a video of his

74
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,439
video which was being believed

75
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,519
about on the events geopolitical events

76
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,800
around this case

77
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:36,240
an article the story of what has

78
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,240
actually occurred around this time

79
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,880
so that is the ss7 network but now let's

80
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,880
look at as well

81
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,200
[Music]

82
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,880
it's very very similar again in which

83
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,880
case

84
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,839
and in this case there's nothing to stop

85
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,839
the attacker using an error

86
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,839
harvest information using this command

87
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,839
at the time

88
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,880
tracking is the key part to receive

89
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,839
information but information harvesting

90
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,839
is

91
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,918
the three commands which you saw earlier

92
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,439
for seven

93
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,679
if i've taught these three diamonds

94
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,439
comedy commandos we can actually see

95
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,959
that they

96
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,959
are protocol positions as

awesome jersey network and the

102
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,760
destination of this

103
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:28,400
is a first of all

104
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,679
username and point and see the nets

105
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,919
somewhere in

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,840
this region this is g in mobile country

107
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,799
called geography regions

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,520
asia pacific region and in this

109
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,639
particular case there were questions

110
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,639
so there is no reason

111
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,520
um i'm showing again the

112
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,840
channel islands but there's multiple

113
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,840
networks

114
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:14,879
over diameter

115
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:18,559
so one important thing to know is that

116
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,240
i've shown you get sucked but this

117
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,760
surveillance companies don't necessarily

118
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,840
think in the world that way

119
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,840
they see multiple

120
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,360
what can happen then it's the mobile

121
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,360
operator

122
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:53,840
on the firewalls

123
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,840
so what you might expect

124
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,639
um firewalls and we just got to protect

125
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,039
the world to protect us

126
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,159
now it will be brilliant if the world

127
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,440
works like this but surveillance

128
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,400
companies are

129
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,400
in a linear path

130
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:53,600
and that becomes a very valuable decline

131
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,600
for a very valuable one

132
00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:00,240
for them to use and this is what we've

133
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,240
seen with this next one issues

134
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,960
and this is why it's so valuable in that

135

this vulnerability was present

we could see this problem

that staggered approach

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,840
and the key thing about sim jacker is

155
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,360
in the past and possibly to heart damage

156
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,840

stand on an sms command

directly to the surveillance company and

therefore

is to show you how much more complex

233
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,800
here's a graph of the 4g network uh

[Music]

242
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,680
one key thing we have to keep thinking

243
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,839
keep in mind there's

244
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,839
the difference between

245
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,839
uh

246
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,000
addresses are sources there's no way one

247
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,960
operator can block off

248
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,960
another content i can

249
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,839
flash

250
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,599
5g starts to get very very comfortable

251
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:27,440
for the attacker unfortunately is when

252
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,440
as well

253
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:33,839
sign up for events location information

254
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,839
especially

255
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,839
attackers will try to use them

[Music]

257
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,720
if you start to read articles about ss7

258
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,640
it could be wide open that is

259
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,640
not the case for the team operator

260
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,640
um it's also at the same time

and again

263
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,558
from our perspective the key thing is

264
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,960
that like many types of security you

265
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,960
can't just

266
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:35,839
