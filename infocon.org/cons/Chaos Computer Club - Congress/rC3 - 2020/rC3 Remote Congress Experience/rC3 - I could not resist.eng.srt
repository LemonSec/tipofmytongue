1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:10,520
[Music]

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,520
[Applause]

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,320
it's ambitious goal

4
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,599
to make your own wafer well you might be

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,359
in the right talk now

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,119
the following lecture i couldn't resist

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,039
our presenter noodle

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,400
will explain how to perform electron

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,800
beam lithography

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,799
but do it yourself way let me switch

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,840
over to new who is really down to the

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,840
atomic level

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,519
of kids so hello hi there hi

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:47,520
our talk is about how to make your own

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,440
crappy pmma based resist for ebl

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,960
so it's not that it already works

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,640
perfectly but

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,800
you know it's kind of a start

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,239
our primary interest is in kind of

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,718
on-ship photonics

21
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,959
if you will so by that we mean

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,360
integrating photonic components like

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,200
waveguides or gratings on a ship scale

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,439
level

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,799
and we're also interested in making our

26
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,960
own mems devices

27
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,640
so yeah i guess that sums up what we're

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,960
trying to do

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,680
of course you could also use ebl and

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,720
masks generated by it for semiconductor

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,759
stuff

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,039
but that's kind of off our scope to be

33
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,159
honest

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,720
but also very fast fascinating stuff

35
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,720
actually

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,759
so we want to make ebl at home

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,360
besides an sem which is actually

38
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,799
relatively cheap

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,039
between 400 and 1500 euros if you look

40
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:52,000
long enough on ebay

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,399
so besides an sem you need the chemistry

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,799
and the thing is the chemistry the pros

43
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,799
are using for lithography in general

44
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:04,000
is price-wise pretty hefty

45
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,159
if you go to those go-to vendors it

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,520
easily adds up to much more than the

47
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,120
price for a used

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,799
shitty old sem itself

49
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,440
so what to do right

50
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:22,400
cook your own soup and maybe it's good

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:26,319
enough for your and our purposes

52
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,560
so what is ebl ebl stands for electron

53
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,799
beam lithography

54
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,800
in the end it's simply using the rig we

55
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,160
all know for scanning electron beam

56
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,200
microscopy

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,680
for lithography the scanning beam

58
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,319
changes the chemical properties like the

59
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,239
solubility of a resist

60
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,518
and that's the way you can draw figures

61
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,160
into the resist

62
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,160
with a beam

63
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,680
what sucks it's super slow compared with

64
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,080
other lithography principles

65
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,319
the electrons are charging the resist

66
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,080
and maybe interfere with the substrate

67
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,440
or whatever you want to ebl

68
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,680
in a bad or maybe destructive way

69
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,560
to prevent this you could try to coat

70
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,519
your stuff

71
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,840
with a thin hopefully not disturbing

72
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,159
conductive layer

73
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,680
but sometimes that's not possible

74
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,440
because it could undermine

75
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,840
what you're actually trying to

76
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,480
accomplish

77
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,360
it's also necessary that your workpiece

78
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,399
is somehow

79
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:33,840
vacuum compatible if not

80
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,840
maybe it's not the right process for it

81
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,560
on the pro side you have the fact that

82
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,400
it needs no mass

83
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,560
of course there are other maskless

84
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,959
processes like using dlp

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:54,400
dmd based projectors or laser writing

86
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,080
awesome stuff to be honest the other

87
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
thing is that in principle

88
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,720
you can achieve pretty high resolutions

89
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,040
with ebl

90
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,120
because you're using electrons you can

91
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,239
neglect the broly wavelength

92
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,879
above 100 nanometer-ish resolutions

93
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,879
completely

94
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,720
there is a wide variety of resists you

95
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,079
can use for ebl

96
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,160
they have different fields of

97
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,759
application

98
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,840
we have tried nitrocellulose nc

99
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,520
but it didn't work so we switch to one

100
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,520
of the most common ebl resists

101
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,520
pmma

102
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,639
pmma comes in chains of different

103
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,639
lengths or molecular weight

104
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,360
you can cut or cross-link them

105
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,400
as far as we know pmma is the best

106
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,400
documented resist for ebl

107
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,198
it's easily available and cheap

108
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,599
you can use many different solvents some

109
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,639
of them

110
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,600
aren't really toxic if you let modern

111
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,120
resists like

112
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:11,840
ztp aside pmma can achieve the highest

113
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,840
resolutions and aspect ratios

114
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,880
we use pmma as a positive resist

115
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,719
that means that the electrons induce a

116
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,360
chain incision process

117
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,320
which cuts the pmma chains into smaller

118
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,280
parts

119
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,240
which makes them easier soluble soluble

120
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,239
in the developers

121
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,680
the positive process itself is

122
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:40,080
relatively easy

123
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,160
you apply the resist via spin coating

124
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,400
then you have to pre-bake it to remove

125
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,720
the remaining solvent from the resist

126
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,840
layer

127
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,919
after that you put it in your ebl system

128
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,039
and expose it then you remove the

129
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,240
exposed resist

130
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:01,440
parts with the developer we are using

131
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,080
mibk for that

132
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,800
after that you can do the next process

133
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,318
step like

134
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,960
physical vapor deposition or

135
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:13,120
electroplating

136
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,120
to get the final structures you want

137
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,120
the developers composition we are using

138
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,479
is ipa

139
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,479
with mibk three to one

140
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,318
yeah there are many applications of

141
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,120
structured

142
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,360
resists you can use it as a mask as

143
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,759
already explained

144
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,919
but you can also use it as a structural

145
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,000
component for chemistry on ship

146
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:46,639
applications or in mems

147
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
or as a structural dielectric for high

148
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,720
frequency and optical

149
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,720
components

150
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,639
as the ebl system we are using an old

151
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,880
sem

152
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,840
we kind of retrofitted it using a red

153
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,840
pattern as the signal generator

154
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,160
to design your masks or geometry in

155
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,880
general

156
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,800
you can use every cad tool chain you

157
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,919
want

158
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,240
if you use hardware like the red tire

159
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,359
you have access to a wide variety of

160
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,479
tools and scripts

161
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,880
doing the boring stuff like file parsing

162
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,880
for you

163
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,039
we should also mention the most common

164
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,639
mask file formats

165
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:36,159
first there's gds2

166
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,160
and the more modern oasis

167
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,240
and then there is an idea we had during

168
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,680
the last days that it could be worth it

169
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,800
to try to define

170
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,479
yet another file format for that task

171
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,720
simply because those two that we

172
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,758
mentioned are both lacking many modern

173
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,400
features

174
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,400
which you know from modern cad formats

175
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,639
there are multiple strategies to scan or

176
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,440
expose only the parts of the resist you

177
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,039
want to be

178
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,280
exposed the most common ones are line

179
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,240
style scanning with a fast beam on the

180
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,280
dark parts

181
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,080
and a slow beam on the bright parts

182
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,400
and scanning fast between the polygons

183
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,800
and

184
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,799
slow inside the polygons you want to

185
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,119
expose

186
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,399
we are using red pittaya because they're

187
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,360
readily available and do the job

188
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,000
using simple jupiter notebooks makes it

189
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,320
easy

190
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,559
to script your experiments

191
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,599
electron optics is pretty similar to

192
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,640
normal optics

193
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,040
from the user perspective so you also

194
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,640
have

195
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,839
distortions and such effects

196
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,800
but you can transform your exposure scan

197
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,839
to compensate

198
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,839
compensate for that

199
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,880
for finding the so-called camera

200
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,680
intrinsics

201
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,880
and also for fiducial detection if you

202
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,160
are in need of multiple exposure passes

203
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,399
we recommend opencv

204
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,959
most algorithms you need are readily

205
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,959
available

206
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,000
another annoying effect comes from the

207
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,640
fact that the beam itself is

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,480
not infinitely sharp and from the

209
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,439
scattering of the electrons in the

210
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,640
resist and

211
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,800
back scattering from the substrate

212
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,519
that's really the resolution killer if

213
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,279
you go for high resolutions

214
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,000
there are different ways to counteract

215
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,040
that one is to increase the electrons

216
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,399
energy

217
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,319
to make the entry region tighter

218
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,440
an additional way is to correct the

219
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,000
effect via deconvolution

220
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,640
to generate the necessary deconvolutions

221
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,440
kernels

222
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,600
you can measure the effect or simulate

223
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,600
it

224
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,839
pecebl is one open source tool for doing

225
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,839
that

226
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,040
and that's one form of pmma we used you

227
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,839
can easily buy it on amazon

228
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,680
normally it's used to fix fingernails i

229
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,800
guess

230
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:27,120
dcm is one very popular solvent

231
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,120
but it's also not very healthy

232
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,839
xylo also works and it's not that bad

233
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,760
tolual is pretty good but also

234
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,760
relatively toxic

235
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,599
any soul could be the solvent of choice

236
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,959
it's not toxic relative to the other

237
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,399
stuff

238
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,640
and it works good with pmma but you have

239
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,200
to heat it up to 70 to 90 degrees

240
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,199
celsius

241
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,959
that's our improvised spin coater

242
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,079
it's a dreamer with an sem stub holding

243
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,079
the substrate piece

244
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,560
after spin coating you have to pre-bake

245
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,839
it

246
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,920
at approximately 100 degrees celsius

247
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,399
for a couple of minutes to remove the

248
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,399
solvent

249
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,959
okay that's the test pattern

250
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:33,839
and our first result not that good

251
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,839
the reference square is 100 micrometers

252
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:43,200
another try the distance between the

253
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:47,040
scale lines is 10 micrometers

254
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,680
one example of accidental crosslinking

255
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,199
most of the resist was removed but some

256
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,880
parts with high dosage

257
00:11:51,200 --> 00:12:00,399
are of decreased solubility

258
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,399
that's a better example

259
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,279
another example of accidental cross

260
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,040
linkage

261
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,839
we made last night both squares are

262
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,839
10 micrometers

263
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,959
and thanks to sleepy old joyce for

264
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,959
providing us with the wafers

265
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,839
so thank you yeah

266
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,839
thank you any questions

267
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,519
thanks for the talk so let's have a look

268
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,680
do we have questions no

269
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,680
we don't have any questions here at the

270
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,399
moment um

271
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,239
guys if you wanna ask something if you

272
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,079
wanna ask noodle

273
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:57,279
go ahead use our communication channels

274
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,279
twitter methadone and irc

275
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,160
otherwise let me quickly

276
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,120
ask you so what about the resolution

277
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,199
range you can

278
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,360
you can get with this technique with

279
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,839
this do it yourself

280
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,839
technique

281
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,880
so your question is how far we got yeah

282
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,240
right yeah

283
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:28,959
so um yeah in the sub

284
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,959
micrometer scale okay

285
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:37,279
but it's uh still work in progress so

286
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:41,199
yeah if we figure out how to

287
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,199
achieve 100 nanometers

288
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,680
i hope

289
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,240
so somebody's interested if the slides

290
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,360
of this talk

291
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,480
are going to be published yeah

292
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:58,399
i can publish them okay

293
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,519
how can they be found

294
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,720
i put put them on github okay and

295
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,240
link it on our twitter account that

296
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,160
sounds good the twitter

297
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,720
account yeah it's visible so we got it

298
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,719
thanks

299
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:23,599
so far no more questions

300
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:25,199
yep let's see if something drops in

301
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,040
is there anything you want to add to

302
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:32,479
this talk here at this moment

303
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,360
no not much okay yeah

304
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,320
so yeah um there's one thing you

305
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,880
mentioned

306
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,680
one substance which was not as healthy

307
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,199
as it

308
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:46,319
uh well should be or could be

309
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,279
so what's the toxicity of this one

310
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,000
component you mentioned uh which one

311
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,560
tolu

312
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,560
or dcm both

313
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:03,760
give you cancer if you're not

314
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,760
yeah so glove and everything

315
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,359
okay well yeah and i would recommend a

316
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,040
fume hood

317
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,560
then yeah yeah yeah

318
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,160
well in the kitchen's possible but you

319
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,160
don't want to mess around with those

320
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,639
chemicals in your kitchen i'd say

321
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,360
yeah that's true yeah okay

322
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,720
more questions that guy that's good so

323
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
we have some questions that are coming

324
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,959
up what's

325
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,800
what structures actually do you want to

326
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,959
achieve

327
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,719
by the end of this project is there

328
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,599
anything you have in mind

329
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,560
uh something dedicated dedicated goal

330
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,399
you want to go for

331
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,079
and say okay we got it now with this

332
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,399
type of process

333
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:50,880
optical gratings for a 400 nanometer

334
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,839
laser light certain application

335
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,959
waveguides

336
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:58,560
and ratings

337
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:02,079
okay that's cool to to implement

338
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:06,319
uh kind of external small

339
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:09,439
external cavities for diode lasers

340
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,720
yeah okay okay are

341
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,279
those lasers also do it yourself type of

342
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,920
lasers or do you buy them or do you have

343
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,959
a lab accessible for that type of work

344
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,160
uh i buy the diet lasers so

345
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:28,319
this is normal laser diodes okay

346
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:32,319
yeah fabry peru the laser diodes

347
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:36,240
i want to modify them

348
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,759
um yeah sure what's the output power of

349
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,800
those laser diodes

350
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:44,160
um in the mode i want

351
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,519
to use them um

352
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,160
yes 10 milliwatts but

353
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,680
not not not a very high power well i

354
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,959
think you can already destroy your eye

355
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,000
with that

356
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,479
can you maybe

357
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,759
i shouldn't look well we don't want to

358
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,199
experiment that we don't want to

359
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,319
recommend anything

360
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,159
like that well folks you out there you

361
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,359
know it anyway

362
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,720
uh next questions um what does

363
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:16,479
the wafer cost irl and

364
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,480
how much is an electron beamer

365
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:23,599
so our electron beam device is

366
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,760
a very old electron microscope a

367
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:29,120
scanning electron microscope

368
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:34,320
and those are around

369
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:37,039
500 to five hundred euros on ebay

370
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,159
on ebay really okay there are used ones

371
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,280
pretty old ones

372
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,320
sure and well

373
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,600
yeah you only have to attach a signal

374
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,320
generator

375
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,000
like a red pitaya or something like that

376
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,600
and you have um

377
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,720
a crappy evil rig

378
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,199
so how much power does it suck so what's

379
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,200
what's the

380
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,678
uh including the pumps it's uh

381
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,280
two kilowatts one kilowatt so

382
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,679
wow that doesn't i haven't measured so

383
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,960
yeah i'm not sure but nothing special

384
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,080
needed so you can actually

385
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,360
yeah exactly more or less

386
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,720
wow cool well

387
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:27,120
um have you actually tried optical uv

388
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,280
before using ebl no

389
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,159
why just because you're interested in

390
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,160
electron

391
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:37,280
beamers yeah that's one thing

392
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:40,480
the other thing is that

393
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,600
i'm not sure how to achieve

394
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,960
the resolution i want to have and i

395
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,520
guess

396
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,960
all in all an evil system is a more

397
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,600
simpler

398
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,600
system okay

399
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,559
micrometer resolutions

400
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,679
i see all right

401
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:07,039
oh there's another question here

402
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:10,400
uh it's about frequency or so now

403
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:13,360
how fast can the ic switch how fast can

404
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,360
you actually clock it

405
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,080
what well yeah somebody somebody's

406
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,640
asking

407
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,639
how fast uh you could actually switch i

408
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,840
mean if you if you're producing ic

409
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:29,520
with that technique of how fast okay

410
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,639
so we are don't we don't want to produce

411
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,639
semiconductor

412
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,480
devices like processors or something or

413
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,600
transistors

414
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,679
it's more about means

415
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,120
micro mechanical devices and optical

416
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:46,240
devices

417
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,239
okay that's our focus i see i see yeah

418
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,918
next question of course where can you

419
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,400
buy the chemicals do you need some

420
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,120
special license for that for example um

421
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,720
chemical uh license or so i mean some

422
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,520
some poisonous license

423
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,240
at least in germany uh they are

424
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,240
available

425
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:07,520
so you can order them and some at some

426
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:12,240
online shops like uh s

427
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:15,280
reach chemicals if someone is interested

428
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,760
so normally um if you

429
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,399
are a larger research facility or

430
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,559
something like that you are able to

431
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:28,960
order them at sigma oil rich but yeah

432
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,960
they don't talk to mortals like me so

433
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,000
i see okay um

434
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,000
murray questions so they're flowing in

435
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,360
now that's pretty nice actually

436
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,559
um do you package the ic somehow

437
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,840
uh not yet so it's not

438
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:50,399
in i see in the common sense yeah

439
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:53,678
currently i'm figuring out how to

440
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:58,480
mix proper resists so

441
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,480
i'm in a very early stage of doing it so

442
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:05,918
well no i see packaging necessary

443
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,919
currently okay yeah um how long have you

444
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,400
been actually working on the project

445
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,159
when we're talking about timeline now um

446
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,200
yeah a couple of months

447
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:18,630
so oh yeah

448
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,320
that's pretty short success then

449
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,799
[Music]

450
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,360
um another question here um how do you

451
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,240
bond

452
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,678
uh those parts actually what material do

453
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,600
you use to pack them up and

454
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:34,080
something like epoxy yeah so

455
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,520
at the current stage there's no bonding

456
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,960
so but you

457
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:42,000
you you can use epoxy glue to

458
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:46,880
glue the chip or whatever on

459
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,880
the holder yeah

460
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,460
[Music]

461
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,640
well there is another question more like

462
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,559
a motivational question

463
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,760
if you could probably name some

464
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,678
exemplary

465
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:06,960
projects that can be tinkered together

466
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:10,000
which wouldn't be possible without that

467
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,960
uh type of approach you are pursuing

468
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,559
here

469
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,600
um we are compact uh optical devices

470
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:20,960
so i guess it's the only way to

471
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,840
to make that ah okay it goes back to

472
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,400
your

473
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,879
yeah your answer before yeah that's my

474
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,080
motivation so

475
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,840
i know that there's there are different

476
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:38,840
other stuff you can do with it but

477
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:41,280
i'm not into it yeah so you're more into

478
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,760
optics

479
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,678
okay there is another question that got

480
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,600
in um would it be possible

481
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,159
to do those chips with gates and

482
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:54,000
everything or

483
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,600
do you need other more exotic stuff

484
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,919
there's a media for that which isn't

485
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,399
available if you want to

486
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,400
build semiconductor ships with

487
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,039
transistors

488
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,679
you need a diffusion or iron implanting

489
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,039
and

490
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,360
such stuff that's much more complicated

491
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,799
than

492
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:16,399
only the lithography

493
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:19,840
for the masks okay

494
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,000
and well just my my imagination

495
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,918
where did you guys actually set that all

496
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,280
up in your cellar in the garage

497
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:30,880
somewhere some rented space or hackspace

498
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:33,678
where are you actually doing that i mean

499
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,400
laboratory is more or less in the

500
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,220
basement

501
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,520
if you want so okay is it somehow

502
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,720
[Music]

503
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,480
or shall i say is it um

504
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:51,200
can it be influenced by by um

505
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:54,400
by motion not by motion by

506
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,919
disturbed basically by by vibrances

507
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,799
yeah yes if you go for really high

508
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,080
resolutions

509
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:05,120
we are far far away from that kind of

510
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,399
super high resolutions you uh

511
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:11,600
have problems with um

512
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,880
yeah oscillations induced

513
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:18,959
by some traffic or

514
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,120
something like that oh god perfect

515
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,600
yeah yeah exactly if something outside

516
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,479
shakes a little bit

517
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,158
that would be a problem if uh we want to

518
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,679
crack

519
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:35,520
some hypothetical

520
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:39,120
boundary like 10 or

521
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,918
so nanometers i guess if

522
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,399
that's not easily possible in a normal

523
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,880
room

524
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:50,559
so yeah in a normal house without the

525
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,000
yeah sure the pro isolation

526
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,080
the theoretical limit with this

527
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,960
technique would be achievable 10

528
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,039
nanometers that's pretty small yeah

529
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,559
theoretical it's possible

530
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:05,760
this evl in in general not with our rig

531
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,240
but yeah with a professional one uh you

532
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,240
can

533
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:15,120
get down to five nanometers

534
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:17,440
so or less so yeah

535
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,239
yeah i don't know what what the actual

536
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,360
limit

537
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,360
currently is so

538
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,799
yeah another question popped up

539
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,720
so do you further treat the finished

540
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:32,559
wafer after etching

541
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,559
so something you you do there

542
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:40,559
my plan is to electroplate

543
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,559
some structures on it

544
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:48,400
electro chemical plating and uh

545
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,679
physical vapor deposition that are

546
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:54,080
the two things i want to do

547
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,240
all right in the first place and maybe a

548
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,039
little bit of

549
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,600
an isotropic and isotropic etching of

550
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,720
the

551
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:06,000
substrate so but but first

552
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:11,120
i want to have a reliable and repeatable

553
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,320
resist working yeah

554
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,279
and somebody is interested um if you

555
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,559
could actually use

556
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:22,400
uh if you could dose the material uh

557
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,399
somehow to get fats

558
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,480
uh okay yeah that's the semiconductor

559
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,279
stuff

560
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,240
so uh with with diffusion or iron

561
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,679
implanting

562
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,880
that would be possible but i don't own

563
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,640
the

564
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:42,080
the tools for that so i don't know

565
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,840
i'm more uh an optics guy okay yeah back

566
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,439
back again to the optics i

567
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,399
completely understand yeah all right

568
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,120
um let me see if there's anything

569
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,080
popping up

570
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,439
question wise we had a lot already i

571
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,799
think there is there was a

572
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:02,159
very very much feedback at the moment um

573
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:05,760
don't see any new questions popping up

574
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:09,279
um i thank you again i apologize for the

575
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:13,279
mega delay we had um glitches

576
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:17,840
yeah but we made it i'm happy about that

577
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:21,440
um and

578
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,399
thanks again and let me quickly announce

579
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,279
now in a couple of seconds we're gonna

580
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,879
switch over

581
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:35,840
to the herald news show over there

582
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,840
oh okay yes

583
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,918
you

584
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,360
you
