3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:18,080
this is not anderson and he's

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,480
giving a talk to us today and the title

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,959
is

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,519
what priced the upload filter from cold

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,039
ward crypto wars and back again

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,359
and we're very happy that he's here

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,359
today um

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:35,760
and for our non-english speaking

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:39,360
pub public we have translations

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,360
these are talk but of deutsche

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
is

14
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,519
ready to start let's go have a good have

15
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,440
a good time

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,719
enjoy yes ready to go thanks

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,640
um okay um as

18
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:09,680
as the um as has been said

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,520
um i'm ross anderson and um i'm in

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,200
the position of being one of the old

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,880
guys of this field and that i've been

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,600
involved in the crypto wars right from

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,320
the start

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,000
and in fact even since uh before the

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:26,880
clipper chip actually came out

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:41,840
if we could go to the slides please

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:41,840
right can we see the slides

28
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,560
that had supplied the u.s armed forces

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,440
and

30
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,920
guess what happened well in the 1950s

31
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,959
boris hagelin had set up that company

32
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,079
secretly sold it to the nsa and for a

33
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,440
number of years

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,840
uh quite a lot of years um countries um

35
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,640
as

36
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,959
diverse as that latin america and india

37
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,279
and

38
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,200
even later countries such as italy were

39
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,599
buying machines from crypto again which

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,480
the nsa could decipher

41
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,839
and this had all sorts of consequences

42
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,679
for example it's

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,040
been revealed fairly recently that

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,879
britain's success against

45
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,920
argentina in the falklands war in 1982

46
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,280
was to a large extent due to signals

47
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,679
intelligence that came from these

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,040
machines

49
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,840
so um next slide please and

50
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,359
in this pre-history of the crypto wars

51
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,720
almost all the players between

52
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,319
governments

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,319
there was very little role for civil

54
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,079
society there was one or two

55
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,159
journalists who were engaged in trying

56
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,200
to map what the nsa and friends were up

57
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,200
to

58
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,359
as far as industry was concerned well at

59
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,159
that time i was working in banking

60
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,280
and we found that encryption for

61
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,200
confidentiality was discouraged

62
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,599
if we tried to use lining cryptos then

63
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,518
faults mysteriously appeared on the line

64
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,119
but authentication was okay we were

65
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,440
allowed to encrypt pin pad

66
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,440
thin blocks and we wrote a lot of boot

67
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,280
macs and messages

68
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,480
there was some minor harassment for

69
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,400
example when

70
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,000
uh revesh shamir and adelman come up

71
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,560
with their encryption

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,040
algorithm um the nsa tried to make it

73
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,400
classified but the provost of mit jerome

74
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,440
bison persuaded them

75
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,159
not to make that fight um the big debate

76
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,680
in the 1970s though was whether the nsa

77
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,439
affected the design of the data

78
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,080
encryption standard algorithm

79
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,079
and we know now that this was the case

80
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,680
it was designed to be only just strong

81
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,920
enough

82
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,400
and what if he predicted back in the

83
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,559
1970s that two to the power 56

84
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,680
key search would eventually be feasible

85
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,439
the eff built a machine in 1998

86
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,439
and now of course that's fairly easy

87
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,320
because each bitcoin block costs 2 to

88
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,199
the power 68 calculations

89
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,839
next slide please so where things get

90
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,479
interesting

91
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,479
is that the nsa persuaded bill clinton

92
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,280
in one of his first cabinet meetings in

93
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,440
1993 to introduce key escrow

94
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,198
the idea that the nsa should have a copy

95
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,840
of everybody's keys

96
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,639
and um one of the people at that meeting

97
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,638
um

98
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,280
admitted there so that president bruce

99
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,199
lee alder had been asked and had refused

100
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,880
but clinton when he got into office was

101
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,160
naive and thought this was an

102
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,560
opportunity to

103
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,880
fix the world now the clipper chip which

104
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,360
we can see here was tamper resistance

105
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,560
and had a secret block cipher and an nsa

106
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,199
backdoor key

107
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,840
and the launch product was an att secure

108
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,840
phone

109
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,240
next slide please now the clipper

110
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,800
protocol

111
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,600
was an interesting one in that each chip

112
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,800
had a

113
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,000
a unique secret key ku and a global

114
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,280
secret family key

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,440
knsa burned in and in order to say

116
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,919
send data to bob anas had to send her

117
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,840
clipper chip a working key kw

118
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,520
which is generated by some external

119
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,479
means such as the diffie-hellman key

120
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,639
exchange

121
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,520
and it made up a law enforcement access

122
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,000
field

123
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,639
which was basically alice and bob's

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,800
names

125
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,919
with the working key encrypted under the

126
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,600
unit key

127
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,080
and then a hash of the working key

128
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,759
encrypted under the nsa key

129
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,599
and that was sent along with the cypher

130
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,479
text to make authorized while tapping

131
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,240
easy

132
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,758
and the idea with the hatch is that this

133
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,280
would stop cheating

134
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,120
bob's clipper chip wouldn't use a

135
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,960
working key unless it came with a valid

136
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,680
leaf

137
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,239
and i can remember a few of us can still

138
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,160
remember

139
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,280
the enormous outcry that this cost at

140
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,360
the time

141
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,359
american companies in particular didn't

142
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,919
like it because they started losing

143
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,440
business to foreign firms and in fact a

144
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,440
couple of our students

145
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,639
here at cambridge started a company n

146
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,240
cipher that

147
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,160
grew to be quite large because they

148
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,520
could sell worldwide unlike u.s

149
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,440
firms people said why don't we use

150
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,359
encryption software well that's easy to

151
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,240
write but it's hard to deploy at scale

152
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,520
as phil zimmerman found with pgp and the

153
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,120
big concern was

154
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,120
whether a key escrow would kill

155
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,680
electronic commerce

156
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,600
a secondary concern was whether you know

157
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,960
how on earth would we know if government

158
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,160
designs are secure

159
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,359
why not should you trust the nsa

160
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,680
next slide please well

161
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,759
the first serious fight back in the

162
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,639
crypto wars came when matt blais of bell

163
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,800
labs

164
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,800
found an attack on clipper he found that

165
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,479
alice could just try lots of leafs until

166
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,680
one of them works

167
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:54,000
because the the the um the tag was only

168
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,599
16 bits long and it turned out that 2 to

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,240
the power 112

170
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,440
of the 2 to the power 128 possibilities

171
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,560
work

172
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,960
and this meant that alice could generate

173
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,880
a bogus leaf that would pass inspection

174
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,799
but which wouldn't decrypt the traffic

175
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,440
and bulk could also generate a new lease

176
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,800
on the fly so you could write

177
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,120
non-interoperable vlog applications that

178
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,960
the nsa had no access to

179
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,800
and with a bit more work you could make

180
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,919
wrong applications interoperate with

181
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,160
official ones

182
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,719
and this was only the first of many dumb

183
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,720
ideas

184
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,400
next slide please okay so why don't

185
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,360
people just use software

186
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,679
well at that time the us had export

187
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,880
controls on intangible goods such as

188
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,360
software or thought

189
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,199
european countries generally didn't and

190
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,880
this meant that u.s academics couldn't

191
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,919
put crypto code online

192
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,400
or thought we europeans couldn't we did

193
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,440
and so phil zimmerman achieved fame by

194
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,400
exporting

195
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,160
pgp pretty good privacy some encryption

196
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,359
software had written from america as a

197
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,039
paper book

198
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,199
and this was protected by the first

199
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,000
amendment they sent it across the border

200
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,160
to canada

201
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,440
they fed it into an optical character

202
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,280
recognition scanner

203
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,879
they recompiled it and the code had

204
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,638
escaped for this

205
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,919
phil was subjected to a grand jury

206
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,400
investigation

207
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,840
there was also the bernstein case around

208
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,560
coda's free speech

209
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,239
and bruce schneier rose to fame with his

210
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,160
book applied cryptography

211
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,840
which had protocols algorithms and

212
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,240
source code in c

213
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,960
which you could type in in order to get

214
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,120
cryptographic

215
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,799
algorithms anywhere and we saw export

216
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,560
controlled clothing

217
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,159
this t-shirt was something that many

218
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,039
people wore at the time i've actually

219
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,559
got one

220
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,000
and i plan to to wear it for this but

221
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,039
unfortunately i

222
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,120
came into the lab in order to get better

223
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,199
connectivity and i left it at home

224
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,320
so this this t-shirt has got an

225
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,399
implementation of rsa written in peril

226
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,480
plus a barcode so that you can scan it

227
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,360
in and in theory you should not walk

228
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,519
across the

229
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,680
border wearing this t-shirt or if you're

230
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,480
a u.s citizen you shouldn't even

231
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,359
let a non-u.s citizen look at it so by

232
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,000
these means

233
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,800
people probed the outskirts of what was

234
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,040
possible

235
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,079
and you know an awful lot of fun was had

236
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,760
it was uh

237
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,959
it was a good laugh to tweak the

238
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,959
tyrannosaurus tale

239
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,439
next slide but this wasn't just

240
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,440
something that was

241
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,080
limited to the usa

242
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,360
the big and obvious problem if you try

243
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,600
and

244
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,000
do kiasro in europe is that there's

245
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,560
dozens of countries in europe

246
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,720
and what happens if someone from britain

247
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,640
for example has got a mobile phone that

248
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,279
they bought in france with a german sim

249
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
card

250
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,959
and they're standing on the streets in

251
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,959
stockholm and they they phone somebody

252
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,800
who's in budapest who's got a hungarian

253
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,560
form of the spanish sim card in it

254
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,160
then which of these countries secret

255
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,399
police forces should be able to listen

256
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,319
to the call

257
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,399
and this was something that stalled the

258
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,480
progress of key escrow if that's a good

259
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,760
way to describe it in europe

260
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,760
and in 1996 gchq got

261
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,439
academic colleagues at royal holloway to

262
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,800
come up with a proposal for public

263
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,519
sector email

264
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,640
which they believe would fix list now at

265
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,600
the time

266
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,640
after clipper had fallen into distribute

267
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,880
the nsa's proposal

268
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,959
was that also certification authority

269
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,640
should have to be licensed

270
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,479
and that this would enforce a condition

271
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,839
that all private keys would be escrowed

272
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,120
so you would only be able to get a

273
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,600
signature on your

274
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,040
public key if the private key was was

275
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,959
held by the ca

276
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,880
and the idea is that you'd have one ca

277
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,680
for each government department

278
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,519
um and civilians would use trusted firms

279
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,439
like barclays bank or the post office

280
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,360
which would keep our keys safe

281
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,640
and it would also work across other eu

282
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,720
member states

283
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,079
so that somebody in britain calling

284
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,880
somebody in germany

285
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,399
would end up in a situation where a

286
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,399
trustworthy ca

287
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,800
from the nsa's point of view that is an

288
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,720
untrustworthy ca from our point of view

289
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,719
in britain would be prepared to make a

290
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,000
key and solid one in germany

291
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,800
this at least was the idea so how did

292
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,079
they do this

293
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,920
next slide on the gchq protocol

294
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,279
so here's how it was designed to work in

295
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,800
the uk government

296
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,800
if alice at the department of

297
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,560
agriculture wants to talk to bob at the

298
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,880
department of business

299
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,079
she asks her departmental security

300
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,040
officer d.a

301
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,800
for ascend key for herself and a receive

302
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,319
key for bob

303
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,719
and d a and d b get a top level of

304
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,920
interoperability key

305
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,600
k tab from gchq

306
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,399
and da calculates a secret send key of

307
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,600
the day

308
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,399
as a hash of key tab and alice's name

309
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,399
and um

310
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,399
the dso's identity for alice which she

311
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,719
goes to alice

312
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,560
and the similarly a public receive key

313
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,880
of the day for bob

314
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,638
and alice sends bob her public sen key

315
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,200
along with the encrypted message

316
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,760
and bob can go and get go to his dso and

317
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,800
get his secret receive key of the day

318
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,480
now this is slightly complicated and

319
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,880
does all sorts of other things are wrong

320
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,760
with it once you start to look at it

321
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,760
next slide please the first is that from

322
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,200
the point of view of the overall effect

323
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,240
you could just as easily have used

324
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,600
kerberos

325
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,600
because you've basically got a key

326
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,240
distribution center at both ends which

327
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,399
knows everybody's keys

328
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,160
so you've not actually gained very much

329
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,760
by using complicated public key

330
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,120
mechanisms

331
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,200
and the next problem is what's the law

332
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,120
enforcement access need for centrally

333
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,200
generated signing keys

334
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,200
um if this is actually from law

335
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,959
enforcement rather than intelligence

336
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,440
well the police want to be able to read

337
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:46,560
things not forge things

338
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,600
a third problem is that keys

339
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,119
involve hashing department names and

340
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,880
governments are changing the name of

341
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,480
their departments all the time as the

342
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,959
prime minister of the day

343
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,600
moves his ministers around and they chop

344
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,279
and change departments and

345
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,040
this means of course that everybody has

346
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,720
to get new cryptographic keys and

347
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,000
suddenly the old cryptographic keys

348
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,680
don't work anymore

349
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,279
and there's a horrendous complexity

350
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,719
comes from this

351
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,560
now there are about 10 other things

352
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,800
wrong with this protocol

353
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,719
but curiously enough it's still used by

354
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,920
the uk government for the top secret

355
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,320
stuff it went through a number of

356
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,719
iterations it's now called maikiseki

357
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,360
those details in my security engineering

358
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,120
book

359
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,959
and it turned out to be such a pain that

360
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,120
the staff below top secret

361
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,000
now just uses a branded version of g

362
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,480
suite

363
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,240
so if what you want to do is to figure

364
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,440
out what speech boris johnson will be

365
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,440
making tomorrow

366
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,600
you just have to guess the password

367
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,199
recovery questions for his

368
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,199
private secretaries and officials

369
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,040
next slide the global internet trust

370
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,880
register

371
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,599
this was an interesting piece of fun we

372
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,880
had around the 1997 election when tony

373
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,720
blair took over

374
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,560
and introduced the labour government

375
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,720
before the election labour promised to

376
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,680
not seize crypto keys in bulk without a

377
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,199
warrant

378
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,120
and one of the first things that

379
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,719
happened to him once he was in office is

380
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,199
vice president al gore

381
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,839
went to visit him and all of a sudden

382
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,920
tony

383
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,760
decided that he wanted all certification

384
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,000
authorities to be licensed

385
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,880
and they were about to rush this through

386
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,199
parliament

387
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,639
so we put all the important public keys

388
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,479
in a paper book

389
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,399
and we took it to the cultural secretary

390
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,079
chris smith and we said you're the

391
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,160
minister for books so why are you

392
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,000
passing a law to ban this book

393
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,480
and if you'll switch to the the video

394
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
shot i've got um the initial copy of the

395
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,320
book that we just put together on the

396
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,600
photocopying machine in the department

397
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,480
and then we sent the pdf off to mit and

398
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,880
they produced it

399
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,680
as a proper book and this means that we

400
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,320
had a book

401
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,719
you know which is supposedly protected

402
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,680
um

403
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,880
and and this enabled us to get the um

404
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,920
the topic onto

405
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,680
the agenda for cabinet discussion

406
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,760
so this at least stopped precipitous

407
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,000
action we ended up with a regulation of

408
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,760
investigatory powers bill in 2000 that

409
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,920
was far from perfect

410
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,920
but that was a longer story so what

411
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,120
happened back then is that we set up a

412
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,120
an ngo

413
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,880
a digital rights organization the

414
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,040
foundation for information policy

415
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,079
research

416
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,160
and the climate at the time was such

417
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,319
that we had no difficulty

418
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,079
raising a couple of hundred thousand

419
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,839
pounds from microsoft and hewlett

420
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,079
packard and red bus and other tech

421
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,440
players so we were able to hire casper

422
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,519
bowden

423
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,560
for three years to basically be the

424
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,279
director of fifa

425
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,880
and to lobby the government hard on this

426
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,000
now if we can go back to the slides

427
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,880
please

428
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,839
and go to the next slide the slide on

429
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,839
bringing it all together

430
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,639
so in 1997 um a number of us

431
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,279
um harley wilson and i and steve belafon

432
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,680
um

433
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,240
and uh josh bernal from microsoft and

434
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,279
matt blais have a broken

435
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,480
clipper and whit diffy who'd invented

436
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,959
digital signatures

437
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,320
and john gilmer of eff peter neumann of

438
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,800
sri

439
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,240
ron rivest and jeff schiller of mit and

440
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,519
bruce schneier had written applied

441
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,440
cryptography

442
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,600
got together and wrote a paper the risks

443
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,440
of key recovery key escrow and trusted

444
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,800
third-party encryption

445
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,440
where we discussed the system

446
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,359
consequences of giving third party or

447
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,560
government access to both traffic data

448
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,800
and content

449
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,399
without user notice or consent deployed

450
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,120
internationally and available around the

451
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,880
clock

452
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,160
we came to the conclusion that this was

453
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,759
not really doable

454
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,199
it brought in simply too many

455
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,279
vulnerabilities and too many

456
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,758
complexities

457
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,199
so how did it end well if we go to the

458
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,519
next slide

459
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,880
the victory in europe wasn't as a result

460
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,759
of academic argument

461
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,320
it was a result of industry pressure and

462
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,040
we owe

463
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,720
a debt to commissioner martin bangaman

464
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,399
and also to the german government who

465
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,120
backed him

466
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,759
and in 1994 martin had put together a

467
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,440
group of

468
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,639
european uh ceos to advise him on

469
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,240
internet policy

470
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,920
and they advised him look keep your

471
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,279
hands off until we can see which way

472
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,839
it's going let's just run with this

473
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:09,039
thing and see what we can do with it

474
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,839
and the thing that he developed in order

475
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,679
to

476
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,438
drive a stake through the heart of ki

477
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,839
escrow was the electronic signatures

478
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,679
directive in 1999

479
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,839
and this gave a reversible presumption

480
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,799
of validity to qualifying electronic

481
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,039
signatures

482
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,799
but subject to a number of conditions

483
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,119
and one of these was that the signing

484
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,440
key must never be known to anybody else

485
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,959
other than the signer and this killed

486
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,960
the idea

487
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,679
of licensing cas in such a way that the

488
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,640
the nsa had access to all the private

489
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,400
key material

490
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,840
the agencies had argued that without

491
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,200
controlling signatures you couldn't

492
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,760
control encryption

493
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,039
but of course as intelligence agencies

494
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,720
they were as much interested in

495
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,640
manipulating information

496
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,240
as they were in listening into it and

497
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,240
this created a really sharp

498
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,678
conflict with businesses in the uk with

499
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,200
a regulation of investigative

500
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,520
players bill went through the following

501
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,440
year and there we got strong support

502
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,080
from the banks who did not want

503
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,600
the possibility of intelligence or law

504
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,840
enforcement personnel

505
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,000
either getting hold of bank keys or

506
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,720
forging banking transactions

507
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,320
and so we managed to uh with their help

508
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,480
to insert a number of

509
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,039
uh conditions into the bill which meant

510
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,360
that if a court or a chief constable for

511
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,039
example demands a key from a company

512
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,879
they've got to demand it from somebody

513
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,679
at the level of a director of the

514
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,200
company

515
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,520
and it's got to be signed by someone

516
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,039
really senior such as a chief constable

517
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,679
so there are some controls that we

518
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,000
managed to get in there

519
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,200
next slide what did victory in the usa

520
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,679
look like

521
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,520
well um in the middle of 2000 as a

522
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,679
number of people had predicted

523
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,200
al gore decided that he wanted to stop

524
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,280
fighting the tech industry in order to

525
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,840
get elected president

526
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,360
and there was a deal done at the time

527
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:01,120
which was secret it was done at the

528
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,039
fbi headquarters at quantico whereby u.s

529
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,799
law enforcement would rely on naturally

530
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,559
occurring vulnerabilities rather than

531
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,280
compelling their insertion

532
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,360
by companies like intel or microsoft now

533
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,960
this was secret at the time and i

534
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,639
happened to know about it because i was

535
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,039
consulting for intel

536
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,960
and the nda i was under had a four year

537
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,440
time limit on it so

538
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,320
after 2004 i was at liberty to talk

539
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,400
about this

540
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,639
and so this basically gave the nsa

541
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,880
access to the search feed

542
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,559
and so as part of this deal the export

543
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,280
rules were liberalized a bit

544
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,000
but with various hooks and gotchas left

545
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,600
so that

546
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,559
um the the authorities could bully

547
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,639
companies who

548
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:45,280
got too difficult and in 2002

549
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,200
robert morris senior who had been the

550
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,120
chief scientists at the nsa

551
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,720
at much of this period admitted that the

552
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,719
real policy goal

553
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,400
was to ensure that the many systems

554
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,679
developed during the dot-com boom were

555
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:01,360
deployed with weak protection or none

556
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:04,400
and there's a huge long list of these

557
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,399
next slide please

558
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,320
so what was the collateral damage from

559
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,159
crypto war one

560
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,000
this is the um the first novel part of

561
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,679
this talk which i got together

562
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,760
as a result of spending the last

563
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,840
academic year writing

564
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,799
the third edition of my book on security

565
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,039
engineering

566
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,280
as i've gone through and updated all the

567
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,158
uh chapters on car security

568
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,918
rollout security and web security and so

569
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,320
on and so forth

570
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,400
and we find everywhere that there are

571
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,639
still very serious costs

572
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,640
remaining from crypto war one for

573
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,720
example almost all of the remote key

574
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,360
entry systems for cars

575
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,080
used in adequate cryptography pro random

576
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,240
number generators and so on and so forth

577
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,080
and car theft has almost doubled in the

578
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,280
past five years

579
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,439
um this is not all due to weak crypto

580
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,320
but it's substantially due to

581
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,720
a wrong culture that was started off in

582
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,960
the context of the crypto wars

583
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,039
second there are millions of door locks

584
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,200
still using my fair classic

585
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,080
um even the building where i work for

586
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,799
example

587
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,199
um the university of cambridge changed

588
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,760
its door lots around 2000 so we've still

589
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,320
got

590
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,760
a whole lot of my fair classic around

591
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,520
and it's very difficult when you've got

592
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,240
100 buildings and change all the locks

593
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,879
on them

594
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,799
and this is the case with thousands of

595
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,720
organizations worldwide with

596
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,720
universities with banks with all sorts

597
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,559
of people simply because

598
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,080
changing all the locks at once and

599
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,240
dozens of buildings is just too

600
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,840
expensive

601
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,240
then of course there's a ca in your

602
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,639
browser most nations own

603
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,600
or control certification authorities

604
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,880
that your browser

605
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,080
trusts and the few nations that weren't

606
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,520
allowed to own

607
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,918
such cas such as iran put up to mischief

608
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,840
as we found in the case of the digital

609
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,919
hack a few years ago

610
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,879
and this means that most nations have

611
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,600
got a more or less

612
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,799
guaranteed ability to do man in the

613
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,000
middle attacks

614
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,918
on your your web logons

615
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,159
now some companies like google have of

616
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,760
course started to fix that

617
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,600
with various mechanisms such as

618
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,320
certificate pinning

619
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,080
but that was a deliberate vulnerability

620
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,879
that was there for a long long time and

621
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,840
is still very widespread

622
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,280
phones 2g is insecure that actually goes

623
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,320
back to the cold war rather than the

624
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,120
crypto war

625
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,799
but thanks to the crypto wars 4g and 5g

626
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,280
are not very much better

627
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,918
the details are slightly complicated and

628
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,559
again they're

629
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,120
described in the book bluetooth is easy

630
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,158
to hack

631
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,479
that's another piece of legacy and as i

632
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,679
mentioned the agencies on the

633
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,440
certs responsible disclosure pipeline

634
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,679
which means that they get a free far

635
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,240
hose of zero days that they can exploit

636
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,640
for

637
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,880
perhaps a month or three before these

638
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,840
end up being patched

639
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,840
this next slide please

640
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,640
last year when i talked at the chaos

641
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,159
communications congress the audience

642
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,919
um chose this as the cover for my

643
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,600
security engineering book

644
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,520
that's now out and it's the process of

645
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,280
writing this that brought home to me

646
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,120
the scale of the damage that we still

647
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,960
suffered as a result of crypto war one

648
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,559
so let's move on to the next slide and

649
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,480
the next

650
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,158
period of history which we might call

651
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,000
the war on terror

652
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,559
and i've arbitrarily put this down as

653
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,960
2000 to 2013.

654
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,879
although some countries stopped using

655
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,600
the trey's war on terror in

656
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,320
about 2008 once we have got rid of

657
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,480
george w

658
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,080
bush and tony blair but that's a

659
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,840
historical convenience

660
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,199
this is if you like the central period

661
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,639
in our tale

662
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,039
and it starts off with a lot of

663
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,840
harassment around the edges

664
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,760
of um security and cryptography for

665
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,199
example

666
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,480
in 2000 tony blair promoted the eu drill

667
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,640
use regulation

668
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:03,360
number 1334 to extend export controls

669
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,000
from tangible goods such as rifles and

670
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,240
tanks to

671
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
intangibles such as crit to suffer

672
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,559
despite the fact

673
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,720
that he had you know basically declared

674
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:15,200
peace on the tech industry

675
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,440
two years later in 2002 the uk

676
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,840
parliament bolted an export control bill

677
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,640
that was going to transpose this

678
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,279
because it added controls on scientific

679
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,600
speech

680
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,200
not just crypto code but even papers and

681
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,639
cryptanalysis and even electron

682
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,640
microscope scripts

683
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,360
and so parliament inserted a research

684
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,760
exemption clause at the arguments of the

685
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,959
then president of the royal society

686
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,600
um sir robert may but what then happened

687
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,840
is that gchq used eu regulations to

688
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,320
frustrate parliament

689
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,918
and this pattern of extra legal behavior

690
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,200
was to continue

691
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,880
next slide because after export control

692
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,320
the place shifted to traffic data

693
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,240
retention

694
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,559
another bad thing that i'm afraid to say

695
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,600
the uk exports into europe

696
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:04,320
back in the days when we were in effect

697
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,678
the americans consigliere on the

698
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,080
european council

699
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,840
sorry about that folks but all i can say

700
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,199
is at least we helped start

701
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,840
edri um a year after that

702
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,760
so one of the um interesting aspects of

703
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,439
this was that our then home secretary

704
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,679
jackie smith

705
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,240
started talking up the need for a comms

706
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,840
database a database of all the metadata

707
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,880
of who had phoned whom when

708
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,639
who had sent an email to whom when so

709
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,640
the police could continue to use the

710
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,760
traditional contact tracing techniques

711
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,600
online

712
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,520
and the line that we got hammered home

713
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,959
to us again and again and again was if

714
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,400
you've got nothing to hide

715
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,200
you've got nothing to fear what then

716
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,559
happened

717
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,559
in 2008 is that a very bad person

718
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,000
um walked into parliament and went to

719
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,039
the pc where

720
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,960
the expense claims of mps were kept and

721
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,158
they copied all the expense claims onto

722
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,840
a dvd

723
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,840
and they hopped it around fleet street

724
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,320
until the daily telegraph bought it from

725
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,158
them for 400 000 pounds

726
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,600
and then for the best part of the year

727
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,440
the daily telegraph was

728
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,279
telling scandalous things about what

729
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,520
various members of parliament had

730
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,279
claimed from the taxpayer and it turned

731
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,158
out that although jackie smith may have

732
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,760
been innocent

733
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,840
her husband had been downloading

734
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,760
pornography and charging it to her

735
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,320
parliamentary expenses

736
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,640
so she lost her job as home secretary

737
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,559
and she lost her seat in parliament

738
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,640
and the communications data bill was

739
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:32,080
lost

740
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,600
so was this a victory well in june 2013

741
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,559
we learned from ed snowden that they

742
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:40,480
just built it anyway despite parliament

743
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:42,399
um so maybe um the victory in parliament

744
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,080
wasn't what it seemed to be at the time

745
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,919
but i'm getting ahead of myself

746
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,918
anyway next slide please

747
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,320
the other thing that we did in the 2000s

748
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,960
is that we spent

749
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,720
um i spent maybe a third of my time and

750
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,440
about another 100 people joined and we

751
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,200
developed

752
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,760
the economics of security as a

753
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,440
discipline we began to realize that many

754
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,760
of the things that went wrong

755
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,840
happened because alice was guarding a

756
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,879
system and bob was paying the cost of

757
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,480
failure

758
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,320
for example if you've got a payment

759
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,640
system then

760
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,879
in order to prevent fraud what you

761
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,799
basically have to do

762
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,799
is to get the merchants and the banks

763
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,600
who buy transactions from them to take

764
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,440
care

765
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,600
but the costs of fraud fall on the

766
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,320
cardholder on the banks of issue them

767
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,399
with cards

768
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,080
and the two aren't the same and it's

769
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,360
this that causes the government's

770
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,279
tensions

771
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,080
and causes governance to break down and

772
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:38,480
makes fraud higher than it should be

773
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,120
now after that one of the early topics

774
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,799
was patching and responsible disclosure

775
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,719
and we worked through all the issues of

776
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,480
whether you should not patch at

777
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,240
all which some people in industry wanted

778
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,240
to do or whether you should just put all

779
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,440
the bugs on bug track or some hackers

780
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,720
wanted to do

781
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,279
or whether you would go through the

782
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,559
start system despite the nsa compromise

783
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,679
because they at least would give you

784
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,960
legal cover

785
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,880
and you know would be microsoft into

786
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,039
patching the bug at the next patch

787
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,240
tuesday and would then do disclosure

788
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,640
after 90 days

789
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,360
and we eventually came to the conclusion

790
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,440
as

791
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,799
an industry followed that responsible

792
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,799
disclosure was the way to go

793
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,159
now one of the problems that arises here

794
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,439
is

795
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,320
the equities issue suppose you're the

796
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,520
director of the nsa and somebody comes

797
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,240
to you with some super

798
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:31,039
new innovative bug you know say they had

799
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,760
pre-discovered spectre for example

800
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,559
and so you've got a bug which can be

801
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,840
used

802
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,918
to you know penetrate any crypto

803
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,080
software that's out there

804
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,799
do you report the bug to microsoft and

805
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,480
intel to defend 300 million americans

806
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:49,120
or do you keep it quiet so you can

807
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,240
exploit 450 million europeans and a

808
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,719
thousand million

809
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,559
chinese and so on and so forth well once

810
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,840
you put it that way it's fairly obvious

811
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,158
that the nsa will favor attack or

812
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,918
defense

813
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,120
and there are multiple models of attack

814
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,000
and defense you can think of

815
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,158
institutional

816
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,399
factors and politics for example if

817
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,360
you're the director of the nsa

818
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,199
and you defend 300 million americans you

819
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,320
defend the white house against

820
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,320
the chinese hacking it

821
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,360
you know the president will never know

822
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,279
if he's hacked or not because the

823
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,039
chinese will keep it quiet if they do

824
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,559
but if on the other hand you managed to

825
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,760
hack the politburo

826
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,840
land in peking you can put some juicy

827
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,840
intelligence every morning with the

828
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,199
president's breakfast cereal

829
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,439
so that's an even stronger

830
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,320
um argument why you should do attack

831
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,320
rather than defense

832
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,279
another thing that i'll mention in

833
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,039
passing is that throughout the 2000s

834
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,399
governments also scrambled to get more

835
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,000
debt of their citizens

836
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,600
for example in britain we no longer

837
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,440
debate about whether medical records

838
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,000
should be centralized

839
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,760
in the beginning we said if you were to

840
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,360
centralize all medical records that

841
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,960
would be such a large target that the

842
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,719
database should be top secret and it

843
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,840
would be too inconvenient for doctors to

844
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,880
use

845
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,678
well blair decided in 2001 to do it

846
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,240
anyway

847
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,120
we wrote a report in 2009 saying that

848
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,600
this was a

849
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,479
red line that this was a serious hazard

850
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,879
and then in 2014 we discovered that

851
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,679
cameron's buddy who was the transparency

852
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,240
tsar in

853
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,279
the nhs has sold the database to 1200

854
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,360
researchers

855
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,880
including drug companies in china so

856
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,639
that meant that all the sensitive

857
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,600
personal health information

858
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,200
about one billion patient episodes you

859
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,399
know had been sold around the world and

860
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,159
was available to

861
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,600
not just to medical researchers but to

862
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:40,960
foreign intelligence services

863
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:44,959
and this brings us on to snowden

864
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,440
in june 2013

865
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,440
we had

866
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,960
one of those um game-changing moments

867
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,080
when ed snowden

868
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,000
uh leaked a whole bunch of papers

869
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,360
showing that the nsa had been breaking

870
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,440
the law in america

871
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,519
and gchq had been breaking the law in

872
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,200
britain that we had been lied to that

873
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,200
parliament had been misled

874
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,640
and a whole lot of connection and

875
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,080
interception was going on

876
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,240
which supposedly shouldn't have been

877
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,918
going on now

878
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,559
one of the things that got industry

879
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,279
attention was a system called prism

880
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,240
which was in fact legal because this was

881
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,399
in

882
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,600
you know done as a result of warrants

883
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,879
being served

884
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,719
on the major internet service providers

885
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,320
and if we could move to the next slide

886
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,720
we can see that this started off with

887
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,200
microsoft in 2007

888
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,039
yahoo in 2008 they thought it's in court

889
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,039
for a year they lost and then google and

890
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:42,158
facebook and so on got added

891
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,679
and this basically enabled um the nsa to

892
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,799
go to someone like google

893
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,159
and say ross j anderson at gmail.com is

894
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,360
a foreign national where there for

895
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,039
entitled to

896
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,719
read his traffic kindly give us his

897
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,279
gmail and google would say

898
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,159
yes sir for americans you have to show

899
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,240
probable cause

900
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,000
they've committed a crime for foreigners

901
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,880
you simply have to show probable cause

902
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,880
that they're a foreigner

903
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:10,879
and next slide this

904
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,640
disclosure from snowden disclosed

905
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:17,919
that prism despite the fact that it only

906
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,000
cost about uh 20 million dollars a year

907
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,000
was generating something like half of

908
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,519
all the intelligence that the nsa was

909
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,720
using

910
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:30,720
by the end of financial year 2012

911
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,480
but that was not all next slide please

912
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,720
the thing that really annoyed google was

913
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,480
this slide on a deck from a presentation

914
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,799
at gchq

915
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,919
showing how the nsa was not merely

916
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,960
connecting stuff

917
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,200
through the front door by serving

918
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,960
warrants on google in mountain view

919
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,559
it was collecting stuff through the back

920
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,320
door as well because they were

921
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,039
harvesting the plain text

922
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,360
copies of gmail and maps and docs and so

923
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,440
on

924
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,120
which were being sent backwards and

925
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,559
forwards between google's different data

926
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,559
centers

927
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,840
and the little smiley face which you can

928
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,240
see on the sticky

929
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,360
um got sergey and friends really really

930
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,559
uptight

931
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,000
and they just decided right you know

932
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,200
you know we're not going to allow this

933
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,480
they will have to knock and show

934
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,240
warrants in the future

935
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,399
and there was a crash program at all the

936
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,080
major internet service providers to

937
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,479
encrypt all the traffic

938
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,279
um so that in future things could only

939
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,200
be work

940
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:28,480
got would mean by means of a warrant

941
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,279
next slide please the eu

942
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,960
was really not was was really annoyed by

943
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,960
what was called operation socialist

944
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:42,780
um operation socialist

945
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,200
um was um

946
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:48,080
[Music]

947
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,120
basically the hack of belgiacon and the

948
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,960
idea

949
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,199
was that gchq spearfished some um

950
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,279
technical staff at belgiacom and this

951
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,919
enabled them to wire up all the traffic

952
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:03,360
at the european commission in brussels

953
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,360
and you know as well as

954
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,239
mobile phone traffic to and from various

955
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,199
um

956
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:13,118
countries in africa and this is rather

957
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,799
amazing it's as if nicola sturgeon the

958
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,159
first minister of scotland

959
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,320
had tasked police scotland with

960
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,800
packing bt so that she could work out

961
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:26,240
what was going on with the parliament

962
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,000
in london so this annoyed a number of

963
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:31,678
people

964
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,679
with the next slide we can see

965
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:39,679
that the um the operation bull run

966
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,119
um and operation edge hill as gchq

967
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,119
called their version of it

968
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,119
have been aggressive multi-pronged

969
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,040
efforts to break widely used internet

970
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,440
encryption technologies

971
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,480
and we learned an awful lot about what

972
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,960
was being done to break vpns worldwide

973
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,839
um and what had been done in terms of

974
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,640
inserting

975
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,078
vulnerabilities in protocols getting

976
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,759
people to use

977
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,760
vulnerable prime numbers for

978
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,880
diffie-hellman key exchange and so on

979
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,359
and so forth

980
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,720
next slide thrust slide and bull run and

981
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,720
edge hill

982
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,560
sigin's enabling project actively

983
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,720
engages the u.s and foreign i.t

984
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,000
industries to cover the influence and or

985
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,399
overtly leverage

986
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,240
their commercial products designs these

987
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,920
design changes make the systems in

988
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,720
question exploitable through cigarette

989
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,640
collection

990
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,399
endpoint midpoint etcetera with full

991
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,000
knowledge of the modification

992
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,000
the consumer and other adversaries

993
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,720
however the system security remains

994
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,480
intact next slide

995
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,000
so the insert vulnerabilities into

996
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,400
commercial systems i t

997
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,800
systems networks endpoint communication

998
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,839
devices used by targets

999
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,000
next slide

1000
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,000
and he also influenced policy standards

1001
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,520
and specifications for commercial public

1002
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,480
key technologies

1003
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,880
and this was the smoking gun that crypto

1004
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,359
war

1005
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,040
one had not actually ended it had just

1006
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,480
gone

1007
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,720
undercover and so with this things come

1008
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,599
out into the open next slide so we could

1009
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,720
perhaps

1010
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,960
um date crypto war ii to the snowden

1011
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,879
disclosures in their aftermath

1012
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,720
in america it must be said that all

1013
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,320
three arms of the u.s government showed

1014
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,959
at least mild remorse

1015
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,560
obama set up the nsa review group and

1016
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,119
adopted most of what it said

1017
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,799
except on the equities issue congress

1018
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,000
dropped debtor retention when it renewed

1019
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,680
the patriot act

1020
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,680
and the fisa court introduced an

1021
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,520
advocate for targets

1022
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,279
um tech companies as i mentioned

1023
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,400
starting started encrypting all their

1024
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,640
traffic

1025
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,560
in the uk on the other hand governments

1026
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,118
express expressed no remarks at

1027
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,119
all and they pass the investigatory

1028
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,880
powers act and legalize all the unlawful

1029
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,040
things they've already been doing

1030
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,920
and they can now order from secretly to

1031
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,079
do anything they physically can

1032
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,839
however debtor attention was mixed by

1033
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,839
the european courts

1034
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,640
the academic response in the next slide

1035
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,839
keys under doormats

1036
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,000
much the same authors as before we

1037
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,480
analyzed the new situation and came to

1038
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,200
much of the same conclusions

1039
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:15,440
next slide the 2018 gchq proposals

1040
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,839
from ian levy and crispin robinson

1041
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,720
proposed to add ghost users to whatsapp

1042
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,279
and

1043
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,279
facetime calls in response to warrants

1044
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,440
the idea is that you've got an fbi

1045
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,280
key on your device keyring you still

1046
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,400
have end-to-end crypto you just have an

1047
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,400
extra end

1048
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,599
and this of course fails the keys under

1049
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,200
doormats tests

1050
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,800
your software would abandon best

1051
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,160
practice it would create targets and

1052
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,839
increase complexity

1053
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,279
and it would also have to lie about

1054
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,400
trust

1055
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,400
next slide please

1056
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,880
this brings us to the upload filters

1057
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,599
which were proposed

1058
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,480
over the past six months they first

1059
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,520
surfaced in

1060
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,000
early 2020 via stanford think tank

1061
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,200
and they were adopted by commissioner

1062
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,119
ulva johansson

1063
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,399
on june the ninth start of the german

1064
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,240
presidency

1065
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,440
on the 20th of september we're going to

1066
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,839
meet tech paper

1067
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,320
whose authors include our gchq friends

1068
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:12,480
ian levy and crispin robinson

1069
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,240
the top options are that you filter in

1070
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,680
client software

1071
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,520
assisted by a server as client side only

1072
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,960
filtering is too constrained and easy to

1073
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,880
compromise

1074
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,880
the excuse is that you want to stop

1075
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,079
illegal materials such as child sex

1076
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,200
abuse images

1077
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:31,359
being shared over end-to-end messaging

1078
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,520
systems such as whatsapp

1079
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,640
various ngos objected and we had a

1080
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,400
meeting with the

1081
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,319
commission which was a little bit like a

1082
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,400
stockholm syndrome event

1083
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,599
we had one official there on the child

1084
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,839
protection front

1085
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,000
uh thanks by half a dozen officials from

1086
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,040
various security bodies departments and

1087
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,200
agencies

1088
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,960
who seem to be clearly driving the thing

1089
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,078
with child protection merely being an

1090
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,280
excuse

1091
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:57,599
so where might this lead

1092
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,160
well the obvious things to worry about

1093
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,640
are as a similar language in the

1094
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,720
new terror regulation you can expect the

1095
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,040
filter to extend from child sex abuse

1096
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,359
material to terror

1097
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,839
and static filtering won't work because

1098
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,119
if there's a bad list of 100 000

1099
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,799
forbidden images

1100
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,240
then the bad people will just go out and

1101
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,440
make another 100

1102
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,319
000 child sex abuse images so the

1103
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,839
filtering will have to become dynamic

1104
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,079
and then the question is whether your

1105
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:28,078
formal blockers are reported

1106
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,520
and does an existing legal duty in a

1107
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,760
number of countries and

1108
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,839
um in the uk too although this is

1109
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,320
obviously no longer a member state

1110
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,040
um an existing duty to report terrorist

1111
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,560
stuff

1112
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,040
and the question is who will be in

1113
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:46,560
charge of updating the filters

1114
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,560
what's going to happen then next slide

1115
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,560
well we've seen um an illustration

1116
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,480
during the lockdown

1117
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,400
in april the french and dutch government

1118
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,960
sent an update to all emperor chat

1119
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,960
mobile phones with a rootkit which

1120
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,160
copied messages crypto keys and lock

1121
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,480
screen passwords

1122
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,399
the anchor chat was a brand of mobile

1123
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,800
phone that was sold through

1124
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,760
underground channels to various criminal

1125
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,400
groups

1126
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:16,079
and others and since this was largely

1127
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:18,079
used by criminals of various kinds

1128
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,079
the uk government justified bulk

1129
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,640
intercept

1130
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,400
by passing it off as targeted equipment

1131
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,680
interference in other words they wrought

1132
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,200
a targeted warrant

1133
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:32,160
for all 45 000 encore chat handsets

1134
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,078
and of 10 000 users in the uk 800 were

1135
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,319
arrested in june when the raw tapping

1136
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,599
exercise was completed

1137
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:41,680
now again this appears to ignore the

1138
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,079
laws that we have on the books because

1139
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,078
even our investigatory powers act

1140
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,280
rules out bulk interception of uk

1141
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,280
residents

1142
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,880
and those who follow such matters will

1143
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,000
know that there was a trial at liverpool

1144
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,079
crime court

1145
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,040
a hearing of whether this stuff was

1146
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,599
admissible

1147
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,880
and we should have a first verdict on

1148
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,040
that

1149
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,480
early in the new year then that will no

1150
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,359
doubt go to appeal

1151
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,720
and if the material is held to be

1152
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,560
admissible then there will be a whole

1153
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,399
series of trials

1154
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,400
so this brings me to my final point

1155
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,759
what can we expect going forward china

1156
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,720
is emerging as a full stack competitor

1157
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,800
to the west

1158
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,959
not like russia and cold war one because

1159
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,520
russia only ever produced things like

1160
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,359
primary goods like oil and weapons and

1161
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,800
trouble of course but china is trying to

1162
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,598
compete all the way up and down the

1163
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,359
stack

1164
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,079
from chips through software up through

1165
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:36,400
services and everything else

1166
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,680
and developments in china don't exactly

1167
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,319
fill one with

1168
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,078
much confidence because in march 2018

1169
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:43,359
president xi declared himself to be

1170
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,960
ruler for life

1171
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,400
basically tearing up the chinese

1172
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,480
constitution

1173
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,599
there are large-scale state crimes being

1174
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,319
committed in

1175
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,040
tibet and sinkiang and elsewhere just

1176
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,200
last week

1177
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,759
britain's chief rabbi described the

1178
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:01,439
treatment of we girls as an unfathomable

1179
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,960
unfathomable mass atrocity and in my

1180
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,160
book

1181
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,640
i describe escalating cyber conflict

1182
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,560
and various hacks such as the hack of

1183
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,680
the office of personnel management which

1184
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,960
had clearance

1185
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,799
files on all americans who work for the

1186
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,800
federal government

1187
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,240
a hack of equifax which got credit

1188
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,200
ratings and

1189
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,720
credit histories of all americans and

1190
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,160
there are also growing tussles and

1191
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,640
standards for example the draft eyes of

1192
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:33,839
27553 and biometric authentication

1193
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,920
for mobile phones is introducing at the

1194
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,279
instance of chinese delegates a central

1195
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,599
database option

1196
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,200
so in future your phone might not verify

1197
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,240
your

1198
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:48,160
face print or your fingerprint locally

1199
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,160
it might do it with a central database

1200
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,359
next slide how could cold war 2.0 be

1201
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,040
different

1202
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:57,359
well there's a number of interesting

1203
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,319
things here and the purpose of this talk

1204
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,560
is to try and

1205
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:02,720
kick off a discussion of these issues

1206
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:05,040
china makes electronics not just guns

1207
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,118
the way the old ussr did

1208
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,560
can you have a separate supply chain for

1209
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:12,160
china

1210
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:14,480
and one for everybody else um

1211
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,279
but hang on a minute consider the fact

1212
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,520
that

1213
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,800
um china has now collected very

1214
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,599
substantial

1215
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,119
personal uh data sets on the office of

1216
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,240
personnel management they've got

1217
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:29,839
us government employees

1218
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,078
by forcing apple to set up its own data

1219
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,799
centers in china for iphone users in

1220
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,839
china

1221
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,000
they get access to

1222
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:40,400
all the data for chinese users of

1223
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,599
iphones that america gets for american

1224
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,480
users of iphones

1225
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:46,640
plus maybe more as well if the chinese

1226
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,480
can break the hsms in chinese data

1227
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,279
centers as we expect they would be able

1228
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,720
to

1229
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:55,599
equifax got them data on all

1230
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,680
economically active people in the usa

1231
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,240
care dark data gave them medical records

1232
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,720
of everybody in the uk

1233
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,680
and this personal data is already being

1234
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,160
targeted

1235
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,000
in intelligence use when western

1236
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,319
countries for example

1237
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,760
send diplomats to countries in africa or

1238
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:13,839
latin america

1239
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,359
the local chinese counter intelligence

1240
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,560
people know why are there bona fidi

1241
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,480
diplomats or whether they're

1242
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,520
intelligence agents undercover

1243
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,200
why from exploitation of all this about

1244
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,720
personal information

1245
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,720
now given that this information is

1246
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,720
already in efficient targeted use

1247
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,200
the next question we have to ask is when

1248
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,879
will it be used at scale

1249
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,560
and this is the point at which we say

1250
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,040
that the equities issue now needs a

1251
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:41,520
serious rethink

1252
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:43,279
and the whole structure of the conflict

1253
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,040
is going to have to move from more

1254
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,280
offensive to more defensive

1255
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,640
because we depend on supply chains to

1256
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,640
which

1257
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,720
the chinese have access more than they

1258
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,240
depend on supply chains to which we have

1259
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,359
access

1260
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,598
now it's dreadful that they're we're

1261
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,759
headed towards a new cold war

1262
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,920
but as we head there we have to ask what

1263
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,720
are the respective roles of governments

1264
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,240
industry

1265
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:12,000
and civil society academia

1266
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:15,040
next slide please and so looking forward

1267
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,920
my point is this that if cold war 2.0

1268
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,920
does happen

1269
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,520
i hope it doesn't but we appear to be

1270
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,040
headed that way despite

1271
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,240
the change of government in the white

1272
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:28,079
house then we need to be able to defend

1273
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:30,640
everybody not just the elites

1274
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,319
now it's not going to be easy because

1275
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,720
there are more state players

1276
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:36,319
the usa is a big block the eu is a big

1277
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,439
block there are other players other

1278
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:39,200
democracies there are other

1279
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,880
non-democracies there's other failing

1280
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,839
democracies

1281
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,960
it's going to be complex and messy it

1282
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:47,200
isn't going to

1283
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,359
be a situation like last time where big

1284
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,319
tech reaches out to civil society and

1285
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:53,200
academia

1286
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,000
and we get a united front against the

1287
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,319
agencies

1288
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,400
and even in that case of course the

1289
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,200
victory that we got was only an apparent

1290
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,200
victory

1291
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,279
a superficial victory that's only lasted

1292
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,000
for a while

1293
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,760
so what can we do well at this point i

1294
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,720
think we need to remind all the players

1295
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,119
who listen

1296
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,439
but it's not just about strategy and

1297
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,440
tactics but it's about values too

1298
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:19,119
and so we need to be firmly on the side

1299
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:21,200
of freedom privacy and the rule of law

1300
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,800
now for the old timers you may remember

1301
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,759
that there was a product called tom

1302
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,119
skype

1303
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,880
and which was introduced in 2011 in

1304
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,720
china

1305
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,800
the chinese wanted their citizens to be

1306
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:36,078
able to use skype but they wanted to

1307
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,680
be able to wiretap it as well despite

1308
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,760
the fact that skype at the time had

1309
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,480
end-to-end encryption

1310
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,359
and so people in china were compelled to

1311
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,319
download

1312
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:48,078
a client from skype called tomsky tom

1313
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:50,240
was the company that

1314
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,640
distributed skype in china and it

1315
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,720
basically had built-in wiretapping

1316
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,160
so you had end-to-end encryption using

1317
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,240
skype in those days

1318
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,680
but in china you ended up having a

1319
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,479
trojan

1320
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,160
client which you had to use and what we

1321
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,359
are doing at the moment

1322
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,720
is basically um the the eu is trying to

1323
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,319
copy tomsky

1324
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,480
and saying that we should be doing now

1325
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,960
what china was doing eight years ago

1326
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,560
and i say we should reject that we can't

1327
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,560
challenge president xi

1328
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,720
by being down that road instead we've

1329
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,920
got to restate our values

1330
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,919
and we've got to think through the

1331
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,040
equities issue and we've got to figure

1332
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,440
out

1333
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,400
how it is that we're going to deal with

1334
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,520
the challenges

1335
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,520
of dealing with non-democratic countries

1336
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,200
when there is serious conflict in a

1337
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,040
globalized world where we're sharing the

1338
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:41,759
same technology

1339
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:44,800
thanks and perhaps the

1340
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:52,000
uh the last slide for my book can come

1341
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:56,000
now and i'm happy to take questions

1342
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,319
yeah thanks a lot ross for your talk

1343
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,400
um it's a bit depressing to listen to

1344
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:06,079
you i have to admit

1345
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:09,839
let's have a look

1346
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:11,920
okay so i have a question

1347
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:14,160
i'm wondering if the export controls at

1348
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,839
eu level became worse than uk level

1349
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,799
expert controls because

1350
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:19,279
entities like gchq had more influence

1351
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,200
there

1352
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,640
or because there's a harmful franco

1353
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:27,520
german security culture or what it was

1354
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,520
do you have anything on that well the

1355
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,200
experience that we had with these export

1356
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,800
controls once they were in place

1357
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,799
was as follows it was about 2015 i think

1358
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,880
or 2016.

1359
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,240
um it came to our attention that a

1360
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,800
british company

1361
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,439
um sophos was selling bulk surveillance

1362
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,160
equipment

1363
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,599
to president al-assad of syria and he

1364
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,920
was using it to

1365
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,640
basically watap his entire population

1366
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,240
and decide

1367
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,118
who he was going to arrest and kill the

1368
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:57,200
following day and it was sold by sophos

1369
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,960
in fact through a german subsidiary

1370
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,200
and so we went along to the export

1371
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:05,200
control office in

1372
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:07,520
in victoria street um a number of um

1373
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,598
ngos the open rights group went along

1374
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,720
and privacy international and us and one

1375
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,800
or two others

1376
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,640
and we said look according to the eu

1377
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,480
dual use regulation

1378
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,759
right bulk intercept equipment is

1379
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,440
military kit it should be in the

1380
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,480
military list therefore you should be

1381
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,599
demanding

1382
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:26,319
um an export license for this stuff

1383
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,599
and they found every conceivable excuse

1384
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:30,880
um

1385
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,800
you know not to demand it and it was the

1386
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,880
lady from gchq there

1387
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,520
in the room who was clearly calling the

1388
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,880
shots and she was absolutely determined

1389
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,359
that there should be no

1390
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,240
export controls on the staff being sold

1391
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,480
to syria

1392
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,000
and eventually i said look it's fairly

1393
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,839
obvious what's going on here if there's

1394
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,880
going to be black boxes and president of

1395
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,558
assad's network

1396
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,160
you want them to be british black boxes

1397
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,480
or german black boxes

1398
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,279
um not ukrainian or israeli black boxers

1399
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,359
and she said

1400
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,720
i cannot discuss classified matters in

1401
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,240
an open meeting

1402
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,240
which is as close as you get to an

1403
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:05,439
admission

1404
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:07,439
and a couple of months later angela

1405
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,240
merkel to her great credit actually came

1406
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,040
out in

1407
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:13,520
public and said that allowing the

1408
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:15,359
equipment to be exported from utimako to

1409
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,839
syria was one of the hardest decisions

1410
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:19,680
she'd ever taken as councillor

1411
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:22,319
and there was a very difficult trade-off

1412
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,839
between maintaining intelligence access

1413
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,480
given the possibility that western

1414
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:29,119
troops would be involved in syria

1415
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,119
and the fact that the kit was being used

1416
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,520
for very evil purposes

1417
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,680
so that that's an example of how the

1418
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:38,160
export controls are used in practice

1419
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,720
they are not used to control the harms

1420
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,279
that we

1421
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,640
as voters are told that they're there to

1422
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,200
control

1423
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,960
right they are used in all sorts of dark

1424
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,960
and dismal games

1425
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,680
and we really have to tackle the issue

1426
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:54,960
of export controls with our eyes open

1427
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:58,000
yeah yeah there's a lot

1428
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:01,680
a lot to do and now germany has left the

1429
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:06,079
uh eu uh un's uh security council

1430
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:09,359
so let's see what happens next

1431
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:11,359
um yeah

1432
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,400
we'll see ross anything else you'd like

1433
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:16,160
to add

1434
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:18,480
we don't have any more questions

1435
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,200
oh no we have another question it's just

1436
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,480
come up

1437
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:24,078
second good do you think that refusal to

1438
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:28,079
accept backdoors will create

1439
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:28,079
large uncensorable applications

1440
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:37,839
well if you get large applications um

1441
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,440
which are associated with significant um

1442
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:41,839
economic power

1443
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,839
um then you know pressure gets brought

1444
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:46,480
to bear in those economic players to you

1445
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:50,799
know do their social duty

1446
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:52,240
um and

1447
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,280
this is what we have seen with the

1448
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:57,439
platforms that intermediate content

1449
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,119
that acts as content intermediaries such

1450
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,720
as facebook and google and so on that

1451
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:04,880
they do a certain amount of filtering

1452
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,000
but if on the other hand you have

1453
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,960
wholesale

1454
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,880
um surveillance before the fact of

1455
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:13,119
end-to-end encrypted stuff

1456
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,200
then are we moving into an environment

1457
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:17,040
um where a private speech

1458
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,598
from one person to another is no longer

1459
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,119
permitted you know i

1460
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,720
i don't think that's the right trade-off

1461
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,800
that we should be taking

1462
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,200
um because we all know from hard

1463
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,720
experience that when governments say

1464
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,319
think of the children they're not

1465
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,598
thinking of children at all

1466
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:33,599
if they were thinking of children they

1467
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,359
would not be selling weapons to saudi

1468
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,760
arabia and the united arab emirates to

1469
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,759
kill

1470
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,040
children in the yemen and they say think

1471
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,800
about terrorism

1472
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:43,759
but the the censorship that we are

1473
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,800
supposed to use in universities around

1474
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,480
terrorism the so-called prevent duty is

1475
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,640
is known to be counterproductive it

1476
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,079
makes muslim students feel alienated and

1477
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,078
marginalized

1478
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,599
so the arguments that governments use

1479
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:58,240
around this are not

1480
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,160
in any way honest and we now have 20

1481
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,879
years experience of these dishonest

1482
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,319
arguments

1483
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,280
and for goodness sake that's a more

1484
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:08,880
grown-up conversation about these things

1485
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,880
now you're totally right

1486
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,599
even if i have to admit it took me a

1487
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:17,118
couple of years not 20 but a lot

1488
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,119
to finally understand okay

1489
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,960
this i think that's it we just have

1490
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,680
another comment and i'm thanking you for

1491
