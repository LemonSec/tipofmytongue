1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,639
the next talk will be in english and uh

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,680
it's about building the ccc camp

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,960
of 2019 but

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,600
uh in a game engine so uh it's gonna be

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,119
a

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,640
3d world where people can yeah

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,599
interact but not in 2d like in the work

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,679
adventure but

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,679
in 3d it's a

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,399
a project by richard mcfly

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,960
and they are going to show us basically

12
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,000
in-game or in in the engine how this is

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,719
working

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,160
and the main thing this uh well i mean

15
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,000
this is a chaos experience

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,398
so uh it's it's a it's a call

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,840
to join it's a call to all the

18
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,960
communities

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:03,600
to build their own assemblies like

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,320
they did on the camp so we do have uh

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,280
like a playable level in the end with

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,600
all the different

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,799
uh all the different villages

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,559
it's a unity project so that's a an open

25
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,680
source program everybody can

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,960
can use and you can use for example

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,439
blender to

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,039
build your models so that's that's free

29
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,880
as well it's definitely worth

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,759
learning because it's one of the

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,759
stronger 3d programs by now

32
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:38,840
and so yeah i'm

33
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:41,840
switching over to mention my fly

i have seen uh rich uh

48
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,319
seeing uh seed building the game and uh

49
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,319
we came up the dd

50
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:51,839
to make the mod and uh

51
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,839
hi rich

52
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:05,840
do you want to introduce yourself

53
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,080
yeah um you've traveled with milwause in

54
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,840
the past

55
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,840
you have

56
00:03:48,159 --> 00:04:01,840
okay so but yeah

57
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,319
no my slide's not changing at all i

58
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:12,319
think the lever off is crushed

59
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:15,760
awesome there you go after it

60
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:20,159
um you already gave an idea uh

61
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,320
of uh what off-grid is um

62
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:29,840
how did you get the inspiration to that

63
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,840
in the real quick

64
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,639
we made we need to make a quick stop

65
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:46,560
because i can't hear you yet um

66
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,560
yes and now i hear you double

67
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,840
okay can you try again if we can now

68
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,840
hear you

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:07,840
yes let's uh try that again from there

70
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,840
can you now hear something

71
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,360
no

72
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,560
yeah i guess it's a bit chaotic

73
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,039
uh at the moment can you speak then i

74
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,400
see the pigger

75
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,400
yeah i i can

76
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,319
i want to i want to sort of say stuff

77
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,520
but not relevant stuff that i'm then

78
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,080
going to forget to repeat

79
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,719
so i'm trying to come up with things off

80
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,919
the cuff

81
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,919

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,799
the the intro bit or i was silent during

88
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,520
the intro bit my name's rich metz and

89
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,720
i'm one of

90
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,440
um a small team of three and a half

91
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,280
developers

92
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,639
um making off grid um we uh

93
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,719
yeah we're just a little independent

94
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,440
team uh and off grid is

95
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,199
our first independent original game uh

96
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,280
having contracted for various other

97
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,639
people over the last few years

98
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,359
um so yeah uh offgrid's a game about

99
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,560
activism uh information and

100
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,680
disinformation

101
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,440
uh and data in its prolify

102
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,759
uh so yeah um

103
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,960
and mcfly your your slides are down at

104
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,479
the moment do you know that

105
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,479
yeah i'm um

106
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:45,599
there we go

107
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,240
you know what we have to do this right

108
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,240
now this way

109
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,198
uh the full screen mode seemed to not

110
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,120
work nicely together with the uh

111
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,479
universities we only have some few

112
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,919
slides anyway

113
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,159
obviously if that will be demonstration

114
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,400
if that works so

115
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,319
too crazy why would the long story

116
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,919
because like i'm not very good at tldr

117
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,879
when people ask me things like what's

118
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,400
your inspiration

119
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,039
but um off-grid was kind of born

120
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,638
around about 2011 beginning of 2011

121
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,639
before a lot of

122
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:27,280
um the occupy stuff had kicked off but

123
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,080
just as a load of the arab spring

124
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,878
activism

125
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,640
uh was starting within uh anonymous and

126
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,080
various people around it

127
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,919
um and so i'd actually seen a talk at

128
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,120
inec conference which is a

129
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,598
kind of dull internet protocol forum

130
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,680
really

131
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:49,360
uh that had a lot of kind of very deep

132
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,199
technical talk uh but

133
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,800
there was also a guy called evan moglen

134
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,720
talking about how we'd lost the war for

135
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,839
the internet and how although it started

136
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,920
as an open source

137
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,839
project and we built python we built

138
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,839
pearl um

139
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,519
various stakeholders were taking it over

140
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,959
and taking it from us

141
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,880
and he kind of did a rallying cry to

142
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,560
to people to get involved in open source

143
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,800
projects and try and

144
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,640
uh try and fight the ever

145
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,719
commercialization of the internet

146
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,240
uh he kind of a couple of years later

147
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,680
then said it was all over and

148
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,440
there wasn't much point in trying

149
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,560
anymore but hopefully his messages

150
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,519
continue to evolve

151
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,800
um and that moment really kind of set me

152
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,680
in

153
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,240
in gear for trying to make a game about

154
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,160
um

155
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,600
the loss of the internet to private

156
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,279
interests and

157
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,760
the idea of trying to make a game about

158
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,480
regaining control of the internet it's

159
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,160
set in

160
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,720
a near future dystopia kind of like

161
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,600
a a tomorrow if different kind of

162
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,800
setting

163
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,640
um whereby a lot of activists are being

164
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,680
preemptively arrested

165
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,959
um and that's where the story sort of

166
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,399
starts

167
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:02,640
with you playing a kind of every man

168
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,440
uh a bit of a noob really someone who

169
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,279
doesn't really

170
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,600
well not even a noob a complete

171
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,839
technophobe uh who

172
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,880
whose daughter is a potential hacker or

173
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,560
hacktivist

174
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,880
and uh she starts to get herself in

175
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,839
trouble and you have to learn about the

176
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,240
internet and its

177
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,120
dark underbelly uh in order to work out

178
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,440
what's going on

179
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,200
let's uh really look into that real

180
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,600
quick because we have something prepared

181
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,839
there

182
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,360
let's see if it works yep fingers

183
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:33,839
crossed there we go

184
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,839
that looks like that's working

185
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,199
so there's no sound on that um but if

186
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,079
you keep it playing i can explain what's

187
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,079
going on for you

188
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,800
hey dad essentially this is your

189
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,680
daughter you're cooking breakfast for

190
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,920
her

191
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,439
first thing in the morning all right

192
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,360
actually e-punk could probably tell you

193
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,120
whether the uh the sound is working for

194
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,959
the rest of the people watching

195
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:02,399
i'm hungry um as you can see it's um

196
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:06,079
it's a normal day jen's at her uh cube's

197
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,959
box uh messing about

198
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,719
you're dropping her breakfast and uh she

199
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,199

204
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,279
they're not the fancy ones

205
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,800
but the os is over the source oh okay

206
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,600
well i'm probably just ruining it by

207
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,959
talking about the top fit then

208
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,880

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,519
this is a national security letter

223
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,959
under the official secrets act it is

224
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,440
hereby a crime to talk

225
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,439

226
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,399
daughter will be in processing for 90

227
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,200
days

228
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,200
we'll call you

229
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:54,000
okay and that's that really that's the

230
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,959
setup for the game

231
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,959
that's the setup

232
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,399
good so let's uh talk about a bit about

233
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,519
the

234
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,440
technical parts uh also because uh the

235
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,600
idea is to integrate

236
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,560
the original plan was to integrate

237
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,880
milliwaves in there

238
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:16,160
but now it comes to the game so the game

239
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,160
the game's built on unity

240
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,239
i write here unity can be free

241
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,359
asterisks uh yeah it means the version

242
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,839
that you need for

243
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,399
uh editing the uh level and the map

244
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,839
files

245
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,959
and uh so are free

246
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,200
uh yeah i'd have to register yeah unity

247
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,680
is

248
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,959
is unfortunately it's free as in gratis

249
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,839
but not as in libre

250
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,399
um but it's a commercial engine and for

251
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,560
us the choice was trying to make a game

252
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,519
although this has been a long project

253
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,119
that kind of uh

254
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,079
was as commercially sound as possible

255
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,240
because we want it

256
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,359
to kind of be marketed and put out there

257
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,360
as a as

258
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,720
a game that anyone else would consume

259
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,440
kind of unknowingly

260
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,480
um knowing that it has those deeper

261
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,519
layers of

262
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,800
activism and uh and threads around

263
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,800
around the real things in the world

264
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,720
good okay but the real talk is actually

265
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,120
about the game mod

266
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,920
so i told you already the uh plan was to

267
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,880
put uh

268
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,760
the miller ways into the mod in some

269
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,560
corner in there

270
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,079
and uh then the ccc camp happened

271
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,518
because that was actually after the camp

272
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,160
and we decided to

273
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,160
uh and started on the camp building the

274
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,560
milwaukee ccc camp

275
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,319
which uh results in milwaukee's has nice

276
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,920
pictures milly ways has and half

277
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,800
up-to-date overview

278
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,560
um and all of the other things but very

279
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,680
quickly that escalated and uh

280
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,959
turned into mods being more the whole

281
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:56,079
ccc cam yeah so

282
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,920
uh this is uh how it looks

283
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,359
as a screenshot some of you might

284
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,199
remember this

285
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,720
and i hope that i'm already creating

286
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,079
some memories for some people at this

287
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,279
point

288
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:12,479
um yeah

289
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:14,320
so the goal of for us of the mod is that

290
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,880
we want to have a virtual ccc camp in

291
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,320
unity where we can walk around

292
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:24,160
um it really works very well of

293
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,800
creating those feelings again of this

294
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,319
this point of like oh nice memories

295
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,800
right

296
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,639
um in this game you will have electronic

297
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,359
devices that you can interact with

298
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,120
some of them have been on the cam um

299
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,480
some of them are new

300
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,440
and uh we actually at some point thought

301
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,279
well let's get all of the villages in

302
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,800
there or at least the villages that want

303
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,639
to be in there

304
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:54,639
um so we needed to have a plan

305
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,560
how to get everybody in there

306
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,040
yeah i mean the i think what happened

307
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,800
was you started to make the miller ways

308
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,880
modern we were putting it onto the

309
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,000
well we live streamed the initial build

310
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,000
of it and

311
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,199
various people at camp um like um

312
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,040
the scottish embassy and uh garafol

313
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,479
kind of saw what you're up to and wanted

314
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,040
to get involved and then

315
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,920
in the kind of live streams we did post

316
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,800
camp um

317
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,240
we just started kind of adding adding

318
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,240
people's villages in and

319
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,839
collecting people collaborating on stuff

320
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,880
it was kind of quite quite organic like

321
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,279
that really wasn't it

322
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,480
yeah the gruffle specifically is a

323
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,120
village that kind of

324
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,519
helped us making some pressure there and

325
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,560
uh

326
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,560
getting things going so thank you rafa

327
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,240
so yeah

328
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,480
as you see we want your villagers in

329
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,320
there when you want

330
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,880
um and we need something for that and

331
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,600
that point is that the camp is in

332
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,600
general

333
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:00,880
uh rather badly documented on how

334
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,240
um uh

335
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,400
on where which tent was and information

336
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,120
that you need to recreate a believable

337
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,319
image

338
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,918
and some of this is just in your images

339
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,079
because there's a lot of villages that

340
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,760
plainly didn't take any pictures at all

341
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,119
because their photo policies disallowed

342
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,400
it so

343
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:24,239
we basically would like to

344
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,439
some way tap your memories

345
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,600
if we can find a way how to do that and

346
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,280
for that we have actually come up with

347
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:36,159
two uh possibilities

348
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,200
um the first one is the path that the

349
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,600
graphics took

350
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,400
it's slower it requires us to sit on

351
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,320
jitsi

352
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,240
and it basically means i will export my

353
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,918
desktop to you via the jitsi and you

354
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,360
tell me no that tent needs to go a bit

355
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,880
more over there and that thing needs to

356
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,719
go over there

357
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,559
that works well with non-complicated

358
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,000
villages where all the models that you

359
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,000
want to use in a 3d world

360
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,520
i'm showing you what i mean in a moment

361
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
i already exist

362
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,918
somewhere for us so if you're using

363
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,120
normal tens normal sg

364
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,440
40 tens normal rendered tents

365
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,159
have the common pavilions have the

366
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,559
common desk

367
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,160
beer taking and all the other stuff all

368
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,520
of that is easy because we don't really

369
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,280
need to build models when you

370
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,600
just need to put the existing models at

371
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,639
the right place

372
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,760
um it basically requires us but it

373
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,200
abstracts you from

374
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,679
all of the part of having to do uh

375
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,440
all of this documentation by yourself

376
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,360
like the ending to you with the gets

377
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:36,320
the license the keys and all of this

378
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,320
the possibly be

379
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,600
is the second possibility it's uh you

380
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,679
build your own village um

381
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,879
that is on the long term faster because

382
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,679
the scale's better

383
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,200
but it's also more complicated um it

384
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,880
does not require us to

385
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,400
basically sit there with you the whole

386
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,760
time and did something

387
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,559
it allows you to do it yourself

388
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,120
um and that is the best way specifically

389
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,080
if you

390
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,760
have a more complicated village want to

391
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,918
make this more group thingy like you

392
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,320
want to do this together

393
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,240
or you're using models that don't exist

394
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,520
yet so that first have to be built in

395
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,559
blender or

396
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,720
cinema 4d like epunk who uh

397
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,120
introduces very nicely in the beginning

398
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,640
uh did the sea bass part and he built

399
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,600
all of the buildings in cinema 4d

400
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,280
um and yeah that is uh they are that

401
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,520
best way if you

402
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,039
check out the git yourself uh you get a

403
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,320
development key

404
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,760
from us um you can just ask me i think

405
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,360
that's less complicated if we send

406
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,360
everybody directly to rich

407
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,039
so i will have development keys for

408
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,399
people to hand out

409
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:49,679
and uh if they contribute uh

410
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:53,440
significantly to this uh mods and at

411
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:56,240
their own villages

412
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,600
yeah and uh i think that's the part now

413
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,760
where i think we should just have a look

414
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,399
how it looks

415
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,400
um so

416
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,799
that is uh the unity that now needs a

417
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,360
second to reconnect when the circle is

418
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,679
over

419
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,678
um one of the things that i think's

420
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,720
always nice for you to show is the

421
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:22,480
starting point if you can which is um

422
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:26,240
that uh satellite image that we got um

423
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,880
from uh i can't remember who it was

424
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,120
yeah that's a bit difficult to uh get in

425
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,159
now because i didn't prepare that

426
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,320
oh no it's in there already all right i

427
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,159
just need to put in the layer right

428
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,760
yeah you just need to allow the layout

429
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,919
to show unity does

430
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,400
take a bit of time to allow me to do

431
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:48,240
something now we're talking

432
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:51,200
yep so why was this layer again

433
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,280
it's in the ziklai park uh layer i think

434
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,960
and there's a

435
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,840
something called map an image to a

436
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,840
reliable map

437
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,919
zoom out to something that most of the

438
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,919
people do remember

439
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,159
map there you go um this is the map and

440
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,639
the overlay

441
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,080
um it's a bit hard to see but you can

442
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,360
see it it's uh

443
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:26,080
something that we made to help us to uh

444
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,360
put all the objects at somewhat the

445
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,639
right place

446
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:34,240
um it at least contains the uh

447
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,240
um old images for

448
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,280
the right buildings at the right place

449
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,320
and all of

450
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,320
that so

451
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,840
yeah in this world i'm taking the map

452
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,479
away

453
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,959
another second because that's an overlay

454
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,799
um

455
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,760
that is uh um

456
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,639
like two meters over the ground and as

457
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,720
you heard

458
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,360
one of the villages that has been built

459
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,600
in the beginning was the miliways

460
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,600
so

461
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,320
you have this walk around possibilities

462
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,919
here

463
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:17,039
at the moment and this is basically the

464
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:19,679
different objects that we have here

465
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,679
some of them

466
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:27,919
can be controlled um

467
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,719
this thing for example is a beer tab

468
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,480
together

469
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,159
like this is actually something we might

470
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,080
want to explain i don't know if any of

471
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,679
the people sitting in this talk now have

472
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,879
been at milliways

473
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,440
but this is the beer tap

474
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,159
at milliways and we have put next to it

475
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,240
the beer tab from the sha 2017 which was

476
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,720
from the amsterdam people

477
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,720
this isn't a server rack and this is

478
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,159
nicely interactable with

479
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,240
so you can define a point uh and point

480
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,880
of interest is what's called right

481
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,840
yep and then you can connect some

482
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,559
scripting

483
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,600
um and other stuff to that so this is

484
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,720
supposed to be an

485
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,280
iot tab which kinda it

486
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,480
tries to give the impression and so you

487
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,918
can play around with that

488
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,760
there's other things standing around

489
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,080
there we have a computer here with some

490
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,679
other interest points and we had several

491
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:22,158
devices that really were in the camera

492
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,280
but yeah for the memories for the people

493
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,280
this is the milly ways

494
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,520
but there's more you've possibly seen

495
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:34,840
that

496
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:40,158
and it's possibly easier

497
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,158
actually let's do this

498
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,840
that's just uh built a level that takes

499
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,880
a moment

500
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,000
so it's uh as you see most of the fields

501
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,200
are still

502
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,200
green purely based on the point that

503
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:09,279
most of the villages aren't there yet

504
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,279
waiting for unity to react

505
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,919
yeah that's the process of building a

506
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,360
level i

507
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,039
press the button then you can't do

508
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:23,120
really anything anymore any

509
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,120
way for 30 seconds

510
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,480
pray to the demo gods pray to the

511
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
democrats

512
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:47,840
there you go it's building yeah

513
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:47,840
the world is empty

514
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,760
the wall is full again

515
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,880
so what mcfly is doing here is he's he's

516
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,640
got a copy of the game

517
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,360
that he's uh linking the unity mod build

518
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,360
directly to

519
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,720
so and now it's dropped his player into

520
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,480
his mod

521
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,799
so that is what we have so far um

522
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,120
this is private property mate we've got

523
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:25,360
a flyer walking around

524
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,360
that are still an agent over there is

525
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,918
a lorry and you can program yourself and

526
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,640
the people to

527
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,279
be able to interact with you already see

528
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,200
the

529
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,440
possible view of the two devices over

530
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,440
there

531
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,480
if you uh if you go to lowry's

532
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,600
techno trolley uh which larry's famous

533
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,600
for

534
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,279
pretty much being inseparable from it's

535
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,080
a massive speaker on a

536
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,480
on a um oh what's the american word it

537
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,639
was

538
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,480
here stroller is not here anymore no

539
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,480
it's over by lowry so that you can see

540
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,440
it more easily

541
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,279
i think i can even switch my music uh

542
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,799
looks like jake's working as well jake

543
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,720
is walking around now

544
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,158
so there you go you switch on larry's

545
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,039
speaker pram and he starts doing a

546
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,520
little salsa dance

547
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,640
there we go larry's doing it in real

548
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,639
life in the background too

549
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,480
yeah and uh and barrow i can't get him

550
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,279
to walk around at the moment i think i

551
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,960
worked out why

552
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,279
it's because i didn't put coffee in the

553
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,279
game

554
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,640
you have to you have to give all of the

555
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,640
characters motivation

556
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,360
and barrett's is set to coffee and i'd

557
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,520
miss uh

558
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,039
mis-aligned how to uh how to set up that

559
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,760
particular interest point so

560
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,440
the moment barrett is standing watching

561
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,720
people use the beer tap

562
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:53,840
which is it's unfortunate really

563
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,840
um but he's there yep

564
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,439
i think and it looks also enabled so

565
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,320
they should be able to

566
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,799
actually say something so yeah this is

567
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,000
uh

568
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:09,120
the midwest place at the moment um

569
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,400
and we got some people

570
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,399
in there that's like uh this is barrett

571
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,840
this is yeah that's barrett yep his

572
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,279
hair's the wrong color at the moment

573
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,240
slightly light and he's uh yeah he's

574
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:24,080
stood

575
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,080
still waiting for coffee yeah

576
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,440
same with bianna is also in the game so

577
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,080
she's also

578
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,080
placed on the camp and um

579
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,799
before we go any deeper i think let's

580
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,200
have a yeah

581
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,320
jake is now working there is a lorry

582
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,279
here

583
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,200
and uh let's have a quick walk because

584
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,240
most of the other villagers want to add

585
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,880
themselves to the village that's uh have

586
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,320
a walker quickly on the campsite

587
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,799
um i think

588
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,559
barrett and laurie might be the only

589
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,240
people that are now on the camp that

590
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,639
haven't been on the camp before

591
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,279
so first of all here's the belgian

592
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,159
hacker camp

593
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:11,120
hacker village with the bus um

594
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,919
and uh everything else here is still

595
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,639
very green

596
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,320
because we'd like to fill that um over

597
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,679
here is the core tense from

598
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:23,360
the sea base so thank you

599
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,360
epang for building all of those

600
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:32,158
um and you see the cbs has as we know

601
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,399
the cbs always very specific models

602
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,399
so

603
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:42,158
yeah there is the

604
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:45,840
antenna from the sea base and this whole

605
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,840
entrance was their own portal

606
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,080
and we'd like to get all of the other

607
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,360
villages basically

608
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,879
in there in the same way so i don't know

609
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,520
which village i'm running to

610
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,080
at the moment but we can clearly add it

611
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
let's

612
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,480
quickly sprint over to the graffiti

613
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,080
village because that is also there

614
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,840
and the graphics should be mentioned

615
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,360
there because they are the ones that

616
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,840
actually pushed us over

617
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,199
there is the speaker talks uh this is

618
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,918
not the

619
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,279
the nicest tense yet um the one at billy

620
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,080
ways even has

621
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,320
uh an inside yet that can be used

622
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:26,320
properly

623
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:30,080
and that uh

624
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,080
will be changed for the others too

625
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:37,039
so here's the village yeah they have a

626
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:40,080
hidden tap

627
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,840
i heard but uh

628
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,600
i came over to the gravel at some points

629
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,039
and had this gigantic table of whiskey

630
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,959
bottles over there

631
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,960
so we try to recreate that memory

632
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:56,080
because i don't know but when i uh

633
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,360
hear them the graffle then i'm usually

634
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,960
thinking of

635
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,120
some nice pt whiskey this is the third

636
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,480
that also exists already it's still

637
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,918
empty and the doors are at the wrong

638
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,600
place this time

639
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,080
but this is the easy fix and as you'd

640
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,639
see

641
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,240
uh the overall landscape uh the general

642
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,559
landscape is there

643
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,080
um but what's mostly making to make this

644
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,080
a living place is the villages

645
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,240
larry's got parakeet we're gonna have to

646
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,240
add that to the game now

647
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,760
this is friedl techno mcqueen so yeah

648
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,239
let's uh

649
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,200
go quickly over to uh back to the

650
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,039
millways village

651
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,640
um because on the journey you will

652
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,679
actually see

653
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,240
all of those nice places

654
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,600
you can walk up to the hill i hope i

655
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,520
will be able to

656
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,480
put colliders in that you can walk up on

657
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,480
the tower over there

658
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,679
but i'm not promising anything there yet

659
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,720
my personal goals one of the next things

660
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,880
to do would be

661
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,159
uh the bar here but

662
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,640
that would require building some

663
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:07,120
individual models

664
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,159
so yeah it's uh the idea is to get the

665
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,439
other villagers to

666
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,840
uh jump all in here

667
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,039
and uh help us fill the voids and

668
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,158
therefore creates

669
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,720
a gigantic level what does this also

670
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,720
mean

671
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,399
if people are really good with unity the

672
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,679
level will be open source and

673
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:27,760
can be reused yep um

674
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,120
yeah all the props and all of the models

675
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,440
are all

676
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,959
there for people to use in a share like

677
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,200
fashion

678
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,200
um

679
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:48,320
yeah so let me

680
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,480
let me log in here right yeah you can

681
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,639
hack it so you've got data view which

682
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,159
kind of shows up the data that is being

683
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,640
used by different characters around the

684
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,120
world

685
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,720
and you can ssh into various devices at

686
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,760
different times as well

687
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,679
um if you have sufficient access to the

688
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,799
network or the device's

689
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:10,159
credentials um

690
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:14,399
so here we've got the beer server

691
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:17,120
which mcfly is ssh into

692
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,918
and it's got the users of that beer

693
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,120
server so

694
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,880
mcfly's been drinking uh beer and it's

695
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,000
been logging uh his

696
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,720
favorite uses of um german beer is

697
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,279
best.com and millerways.info

698
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,399
lowry's been visiting army surplus

699
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,240
mining gear

700
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:38,799
um and uh

701
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,159
i think barrett's been on giant bomb and

702
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,120
linux gaming

703
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,720
on reddit uh i think we've got a couple

704
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,799
of his articles in that

705
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,840
in that link list there as well so the

706
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,158
idea is like

707
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,600
you can start to populate this world and

708
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,440
it's pretty thin at the moment because

709
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,480
we've only really been doing

710
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,559
all of the kind of physical surroundings

711
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,840
but you can populate it with interesting

712
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,600
devices that have

713
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,039
different interactions on them of

714
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,559
varying interest

715
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,080
i mean like one of the things that i was

716
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,678
hoping to get done this afternoon i

717
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,639
didn't quite get to was putting some

718
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,559
files

719
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,320
um on some servers like uh um

720
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,080
for instance barrett's got his memoirs

721
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,399
coming up uh fairly soon

722
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,158
and i'm sure uh that there'd be maybe a

723
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,559
chapter or two of that that could go on

724
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,320
that's

725
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:27,918
some good reading um and uh

726
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:30,480
at one point larry uh larry wrote um

727
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,240
a pretty good uh representation for his

728
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,559
um court appeal case

729
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,440
that uh started with a rick roll which i

730
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:40,559
think needs to be kind of um

731
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,440
somehow immortalized in gaming history

732
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,678
um i think it was i think the opening

733
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,290
line was now is the winter of our disc

734
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,440
contents

735
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:51,918
[Laughter]

736
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,080
so the idea is you can kind of find

737
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,279
interesting files throughout

738
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,279
uh hacker history scenes um

739
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,559
different kind of court depositions

740
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,559
different um

741
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,000
pieces of information that you know

742
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,879
people might find interesting to dig

743
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,519
around in

744
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,879
and they can unlock different devices or

745
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,918
different conversations with different

746
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,440
characters

747
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,759
so you can kind of make this into a

748
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,520
living world so if a village has

749
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:20,560
a certain um

750
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,839
village originating documents that

751
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:28,480
can then be had be in the village or

752
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:30,159
an ftp server and small

753
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,839
i guess because otherwise everything

754
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,879
explodes

755
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:38,078
yeah you know copies of poc or gtfo

756
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:39,918
stuff like that i'd say i mean and this

757
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,639
is probably a good point to bring in

758
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,399
lowry and and barrett right to sort of

759
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,079
talk about their interest in how that

760
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,199
might overlap

761
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,399
do you think are you guys there have you

762
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,158
got audio

763
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,638
yeah i think i think that was a cube

764
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,639
sounds like that

765
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:03,839
i can hear them can you hear me no

766
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,839
yep hello can you hear me

767
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,880
also i mean um larry and barrett

768
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,480
obviously didn't make it

769
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,160
to camp and that's kind of one of the

770
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,200
reasons that we've got their characters

771
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,440
in here right

772
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:31,569
um to make sure that hackers and folks

773
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:34,669
could be with us at some of these events

774
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,669
[Music]

775
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,000
next time somebody does want to actually

776
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,560
kidnap me and take me to camp that would

777
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,480
also be

778
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:46,480
great as long as it's against my will

779
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:51,440
it's fine there is a bad echo on us now

780
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,440
okay okay um

781
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,119
okay i can hear his plate but i can't

782
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,440
hear any one of them

783
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,599
actually talking but i guess when you

784
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,839
can hear them the others can hear them

785
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,440
can you get my head something oh should

786
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,440
we use you know should we use

787
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,960
have you guys got a set of earbuds that

788
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,200
you could share left and right on or

789
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,839
something

790
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,839
one i've only

791
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:19,669
[Music]

792
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,839
without an echo it's okay it's not got

793
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,640
an echo oh you see those speakers from

794
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,160
them

795
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,680
are you saying this expensive video

796
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,040
conferencing software has less echo

797
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,279
cancellation than jitsi

798
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,279
is that potentially

799
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,480
quite expensive we are talking about obs

800
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,359
so it's still an open source project i

801
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,880
thought it was something

802
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:48,560
something they didn't subject to the

803
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,560
same caveats yeah

804
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,839
um

805
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,960
so yeah um i mean i think the idea

806
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,400
would be in the long run that everyone

807
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,400
and anyone can add any

808
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,440
sort of documents and interactions of

809
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,640
interest

810
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,000
around camp whether that's devices of of

811
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,839
real historic

812
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,680
purpose or fictional ones about

813
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:20,000
interesting things that may or may not

814
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,000
happen

815
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:25,279
um gibson gibson gives them

816
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,359
yeah exactly we need some gibsons we

817
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,599
need we need some fantastical devices i

818
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,680
mean

819
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,599
the other nice thing about um the way

820
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,240
that the devices are set up in off grid

821
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,079
is you can

822
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,399
create particle effects and flashing

823
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,280
lights and smoke and fire

824
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,359
so uh it's lots of fun to be had for

825
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,520
instance we can make that beer tap when

826
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,880
mcfly is getting a beer actually spray

827
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,200
beer all over him

828
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,640
and change a value in his ai to say that

829
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,680
he's covered in beer and he has to go

830
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,520
and

831
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,640
use the sauna to clean up or something

832
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:57,599
because it wasn't that they will

833
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,680
not have this one but there was a there

834
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,400
was a portable sauna at shaw wasn't

835
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,919
there

836
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,880
yeah i think the finish had something

837
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,800
like that yeah

838
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,760
we were gonna get one for the emf camps

839
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,760
but it got cancelled

840
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,520
when when emf is next year though right

841
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,320
now

842
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,759
is currently planned next year in this

843
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,599
the best of all possible worlds where

844
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,760
the uk government manages the pandemics

845
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,720
that's that's telling me

846
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,119
yeah yeah i guess we weren't thinking it

847
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,078
would

848
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,079
go on for this long

849
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,640
so um there's only a few minutes left so

850
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,040
i mean it'd be nice to kind of get um

851
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:39,200
larry and barrett's kind of view on the

852
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,680
idea of a game where you can mod things

853
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,319
like this

854
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,839
in and and why it piqued their interest

855
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,240
either you guys up for elaborating along

856
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,119
that

857
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,919
line there's a number of uh abuses i can

858
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,040
see

859
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,720
especially now that i've seen a little

860
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,759
bit more about how it works uh do

861
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,959
something like this

862
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:58,240
you know uh number one obviously

863
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:01,040
uh that's another uh

864
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,200
method of distribution of materials uh

865
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,560
beyond the conventional ones

866
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,799
of media and social media and so forth

867
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,320
uh more to the point it could also be

868
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,640
used in the same way i suppose that

869
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,079
dropbox is in some cases

870
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:20,319
as a means of users mod actually preps

871
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:23,359
adding in you know information

872
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,920
uh you can then gamify the process

873
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,598
of uh crowdsourced research by having

874
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,520
participants go through

875
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,359
uh large deposits of information that

876
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,160
are already public uh some cases but not

877
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,279
utilized

878
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,200
i can take a lot of examples of that uh

879
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,560
and actually you know to the extent that

880
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,560
they could find

881
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,240
you know uh elements in these documents

882
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,440
for instance signaling strat for emails

883
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,078
has been the public for about eight

884
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,839
years

885
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,119
a great deal of stuff still in there

886
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,560
i've come across a few since i've

887
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,160
actually in the last couple years i've

888
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,759
had a chance to go look through them

889
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,279
uh there's still a great deal of things

890
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,280
that as events proceed

891
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,640
as new names come up and as we learn the

892
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,880
significance of certain

893
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,040
topics and individuals uh there's a

894
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,880
great deal to be found and processed

895
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,400
uh and so i've always been interested in

896
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,440
the idea of making a game

897
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,560
out of this kind of work because

898
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,480
people enjoy games and uh games have a

899
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,359
different status

900
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,640
uh for better or worse uh in terms of

901
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,799
perception and in terms of

902
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,118
law and in terms of uh all kinds of

903
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,640
things than does you know other

904
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,160
crucial formats so that's the first

905
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,759
thing that strikes me i'm also

906
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,160
interested as you know from uh our talks

907
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,160
with

908
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,920
your kid's daughter uh streaming you and

909
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,279
i we talked about

910
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,920
particular generation which i don't know

911
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,160
how much you make uh make use of it here

912
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,599
female generation in general is there's

913
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,359
a huge

914
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:43,119
potential there uh for uh designing

915
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,119
and implementing non-intuitive

916
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,480
structures network structures for

917
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,000
collaboration

918
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,680
uh i don't know i know i know that

919
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,800
that's not an entirely crackpot idea

920
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,960
i've talked so people about including

921
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,720
yourself but also some engineers

922
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,520
in the u.s over the last couple years

923
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,560
and they all seem to think there's

924
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,599
something to it

925
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,119
that have to be something that someone

926
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,400
else would have to get the ball and run

927
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,040
with though because that's as far as i

928
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,880
can

929
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,079
kind of think on the matter uh i'm sure

930
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,560
lowry has

931
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,760
some interesting finnish ideas well some

932
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,599
of the views on

933
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,680
on that kind of thing that you could

934
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,560
kind of uh you can kind of build quite a

935
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,319
lot of stuff in

936
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,599
in off grid because of the fact that it

937
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,759
has a lure framework

938
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,800
on top of it so anything that you can

939
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,520
write and lure

940
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,240
you can you can write in off-grid in in

941
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,200
some sense

942
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,720
um i mean uh there will have to be a

943
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,160
kind of download

944
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:33,118
any given mod at your own discretion um

945
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,520
caveat because fundamentally most games

946
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,599
have

947
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,280
read write access to your hard drive and

948
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,440
uh if you're downloading a mod that is

949
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,520
running lower it is obviously sandboxed

950
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,079
but there are sandbox escapes and

951
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,839
things along those lines so conceivably

952
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,480
that could become part of the game so

953
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,160
people could

954
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,640
try and create a mod that allows you to

955
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,759
safely run snippets of other people's

956
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,520
code like

957
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,520
level of sandboxing and then people

958
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,079
could try and game that and exploit that

959
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,880
and so you

960
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,240
have a kind of meta level of hacking via

961
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,200
the interactions of different ones it

962
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,240
does have a

963
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,240
in which you know put in put in you know

964
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,839
let's say 10 000 documents pulled from a

965
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,640
certain data trove from the last 10

966
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,240
years

967
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,400
and in the game like you have to figure

968
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,040
out so what is the connection between

969
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,319
say mueller and flynn what connects

970
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,920
these two individuals

971
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,800
we'll find out in these emails those

972
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,359
would be examples of something we

973
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,359
already know

974
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,880
but we could use that as a means of

975
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,598
getting around the problem

976
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,720
press uh not really being able to follow

977
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,200
through on things very well

978
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,078
somebody's not wanting to um there's all

979
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,480
kinds of ways

980
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,520
that just know that one can you know

981
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,119
think of the

982
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,800
the nubs of these ideas there's all

983
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,440
kinds of there's all kinds of potential

984
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,640
here i think so it's stated otherwise

985
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,160
how would you like it rich if your

986
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,960
lovely video game was

987
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,960
subverted into a

988
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,520
well that's the thing we're making video

989
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,200
games you have to be prepared for the

990
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,000
community to take it in any direction

991
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,680
they want so

992
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,520
if it's that instead of drawing lots of

993
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,078
penises everywhere i think we'll pump

994
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,280
for that

995
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,760
i can't guarantee they're mutually

996
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,920
exclusive

997
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,960
that's true like can i control my mpc

998
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,079
and go to anyone's

999
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,000
name and job and say hey you can iai

1000
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,680
i need you to call this order this

1001
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,079
outlet

1002
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,440
you can yeah i mean you can you can play

1003
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,280
as any character

1004
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,520
so although we've got the main hero

1005
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,720
character as the playable character here

1006
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:27,359
your npc bearer or lowry's or

1007
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,759
any npc anyone wants to make in this

1008
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:32,960
kind of low poly style that we have uh

1009
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,720
with the customizable characters um

1010
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,640
basically we can swap them in so barrett

1011
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,879
could be the one exploring something and

1012
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,040
then going to visit lowry to get

1013
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,400
a conversation going about a trove of

1014
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,480
documents stuff like that

1015
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,839
um so yeah the other thing open-ended

1016
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,680
before which was the um

1017
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,520
the potential to use this platform as a

1018
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,919
way of bridging

1019
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,280
time and space in a kind of archivist

1020
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,280
sense so

1021
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,960
you could go to you know the virtual emf

1022
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,119
account the virtual ccc camp and you

1023
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,880
could watch talks from historical

1024
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,480
uh historical camps potentially through

1025
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,520
through the game with the streaming

1026
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,599
mechanism

1027
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,040
and that allows people to again attend

1028
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,079
things virtually but they weren't able

1029
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,359
to at the time and there's

1030
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,240
a lot of people that would like sort of

1031
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:14,078
their toes into aquaculture

1032
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,439
uh who haven't been swept into it by the

1033
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,359
natural currents of their

1034
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,560
yeah the second life that was there was

1035
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,160
something like that that was done

1036
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,680
with events you know actual that you can

1037
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,040
walk around people getting talks and of

1038
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,440
course those were the first targets we

1039
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,560
had

1040
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,280
uh back in the 4chan slash these slash

1041
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,960
days so they didn't

1042
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,839
do that very nice they got their those

1043
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,200
toes right into agriculture yeah

1044
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,880
without even knowing what's gonna happen

1045
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,200
and i guess the other main point is that

1046
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,680
video games and rapidly if

1047
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,399
they haven't already um supplanting

1048
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,560
traditional

1049
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,000
more broadcasting less interactive forms

1050
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,359
of media it's the way that culture is

1051
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,480
elaborating and

1052
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:50,640
reflecting upon society so having uh

1053
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,040
having a game like this allows there to

1054
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,640
be a

1055
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,720
slightly more realistic slightly less

1056
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,480
stained and cliched portrayal of

1057
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,919
hackers you know that happens in kind of

1058
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,440
films it's just like a modern day

1059
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,480
version of a wizard it's just a

1060
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,839
sort of lazy means to achieve the plot

1061
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,839
of the magic

1062
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,599
with fred savage with the nintendo

1063
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:26,240
competition

1064
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:28,720
fight i don't know

1065
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,720
let me hold on

1066
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,280
no to complete the point that i was

1067
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,599
making

1068
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,359
a potential interesting elements that

1069
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,359
i've now forgotten

1070
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:41,520
well you're essentially saying that

1071
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:44,880
usually the hackers are

1072
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:48,560
a plot bridging uh sort of character

1073
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,839
yeah more things to it then oh here's

1074
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,040
this person that you have in the crew

1075
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,480
that makes things happen by

1076
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,640
tapping on the keyboard you know it's

1077
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,280
the actual relationship that hackers

1078
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,279
have as

1079
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,200
people that explore the frontier of the

1080
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,240
potentiality of technology interacting

1081
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,839
with society

1082
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,680
and in some ways they're a

1083
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:05,200
responsibility for the

1084
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,799
the way that progresses if you're

1085
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,399
talking about earlier the internet that

1086
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,720
we had that we lost

1087
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,240
because some people i'm not saying any

1088
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,118
people watching this but some people got

1089
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,200
a little bit comfortable

1090
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,680
in the industry and allowed customers to

1091
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,799
swamp and take over and

1092
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,799
finalize the internet and but we are

1093
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,240
we are always on that frontier to the

1094
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,160
extent that you are exploring

1095
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,680
new ways that technology can be taken

1096
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,200
apart put together

1097
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,200
and made to do interesting things then

1098
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,240
you are working on that frontier you're

1099
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,560
kind of clearing

1100
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,000
the routes uh into which the future is

1101
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,119
built and it's going to actually give

1102
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,599
people a taste

1103
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,560
of that uh in the past participatory

1104
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,680
fashions

1105
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:45,200
what it's like i mean i think

1106
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,560
off-grid's mechanics are all built

1107
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,919
around that notion of the pen is

1108
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,520
mightier than the sword and

1109
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,200
and kind of information as the

1110
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,079
battleground and all that kind of stuff

1111
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,879
so

1112
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,800
the it isn't just surface here like

1113
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:00,319
anything that you want to make

1114
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:03,040
with data being a precursor to um

1115
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:03,680
the interaction is going to be central

1116
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,040
to how

1117
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,040
the characters react and manipulated um

1118
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,720
so it's also an educational thing as

1119
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,720
well so a lot of people still don't

1120
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,078
realize that we live in a data economy

1121
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,520
that the

1122
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,040
most valuable global commodity that

1123
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,960
the economy depends on the flow of is

1124
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,680
now data surpassed

1125
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,240
surpassed oil and fossil fuels some time

1126
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,919
ago

1127
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,359
and then so for people to actually see

1128
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,800
through playing this game that what's

1129
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,359
you know what gives people power in a

1130
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,960
virtual

1131
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,720
virtualized environment or a digitized

1132
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,079
environment is uh having a rich

1133
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,200
interaction with the data levels that

1134
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,760
are constantly flowing

1135
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,960
and just seeing how much of an ability

1136
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,240
it gives you might give people a better

1137
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,200
appreciation for what they're giving

1138
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,240
away daily

1139
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,799
by not uh engaging in

1140
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,799
uh informed consent negotiations with

1141
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,359
services that they sign up to

1142
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,319
strip minor that was that was definitely

1143
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,520
an inspiration

1144
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,200
at the beginning of the game too so

1145
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,079
that's a perfect place to round it off i

1146
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,200
think mcfly

1147
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,880
is ready to um do the outro because i

1148
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,040
think the session is about to finish

1149
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,400
i'd like to say thanks to uh larry and

1150
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,319
barrett for coming on and kind of

1151
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,920
explaining a bit more from the

1152
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:09,680
hacker and activist perspective as to

1153
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,920
why it's interesting as well so thanks

1154
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,919
guys

1155
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,078
by the way so mcfly can you hear me are

1156
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,880
you

1157
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,440
ready to do the outro yes so uh thank

1158
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,240
you all

1159
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,480
uh thank you for giving us the chance to

1160
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:27,919
introduce this real quick here

1161
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,520
with uh nice millways uh part um

1162
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,520
there will be another talk tomorrow at

1163
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,559
17 30 which now also is

1164
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,640
in the schedule uh which is about

1165
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,559
sending postcards to hackers in jail

1166
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:42,160
which is something that we usually do

1167
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:44,079
earlier and happened over there and

1168
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,920
yeah thank you for your time i would be

1169
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,119
very nice if you

1170
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:52,400
reach out to me so we can

1171
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:56,480
add your uh village into uh

1172
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:59,319
this game and um create an awesome

1173
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,640
living digital memory of the ccc camp

1174
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:03,599
2019

1175
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,240
in this happier pre-cup at times when we

1176
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,359
still could

1177
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,319
meet each other which sounds a bit weird

1178
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:11,759
