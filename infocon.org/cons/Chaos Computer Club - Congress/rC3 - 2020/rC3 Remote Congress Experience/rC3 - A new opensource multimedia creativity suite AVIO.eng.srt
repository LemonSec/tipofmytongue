00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:10,520
[Music]

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,520
[Applause]

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,560
so

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,359
welcome back to the cbs channel uh

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,960
you know the face it's right again today

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,320
uh or now

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,760
with this uh talk about avio avo

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,279
audio video input output sounds stupid

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,079
but it's great

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,079
the stage is yours hello welcome back or

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,079
welcome to this lecture

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,200
this lecture is about a little bit of an

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,000
artsy thing

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,960
but it's also a technology demonstrator

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,120
because

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,160
maybe you followed my earlier talk from

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,000
an hour ago

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,078
i already mentioned that this project

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,680
was built with the isomer framework

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,440
which was developed for the hacker fleet

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,039
operating system initially

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,358
and i wanted to showcase um

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,320
one thing is that python developers

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,920
always get

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,479
uh stupid comments like python is slow

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,320
and i i was kind of set out to

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,880
demonstrate that that is just

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,039
untrue it just depends on how you use it

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,600
so i started building a multimedia

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,280
system

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,399
or solution that is yeah well let's see

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,759
what it is

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,520
um i hope you like arts because

34
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,720
this talk introduces you to avio and

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,079
avio is was made for arts

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,960
arts in in the context of many things

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,000
um what does obvious stand for it's a

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,640
short acronym

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,240
and i know it's a little bit stupid but

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,159
it stands for audio video

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,360
input output and actually it doesn't

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,960
stop there we are

43
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,640
taking much more than just audio and

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,199
video data and mangling it

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,560
we're also taking lots of weird inputs

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,159
and outputs like you can

47
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:56,000
control uh stuff with your joystick and

48
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,159
we'll see later um it came up because i

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,759
had all these formats and i wanted to

50
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,280
mix and mingle them and

51
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,119
be creative with them so

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,200
if you look at what the cool kids are

53
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,479
doing in the industry in the music

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,599
industry or

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:15,040
vj industry whatever they all have cool

56
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,599
tools they have tools like vvvvvvvv or

57
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,720
blender or something you know everybody

58
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,959
has to have some

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,640
tool in use to make their performance

60
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,879
greater and avio

61
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,079
aims to be the swiss army knife of these

62
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,000
tools

63
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,879
but it's got some

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,480
focus again but again not it's

65
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,319
complicated

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,319
but you can combine it with any other

67
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,920
tool because of the the multitudes of

68
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,319
inputs and outputs

69
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,319
so let's dive into the technical aspect

70
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,160
of the software suit

71
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,879
um it's

72
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,519
actually just a bunch of lots of imports

73
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,920
and

74
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,440
uh some very interesting glue to get

75
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,679
everything together

76
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,720
um i'm standing on on the shoulders of

77
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,959
giants here because

78
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,640
python learned so many tricks regarding

79
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,760
multimedia and

80
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,599
various input and output formats um for

81
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,799
some things you just have to import this

82
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,760
and then use it and

83
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,080
you're happy um yeah please clap now

84
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,120
it's

85
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,920
it's not really that much effort but

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,440
i think the collection or how to to glue

87
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,879
it together that would that is what

88
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,680
makes avios special

89
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,599
probably um behind the scenes uh as i

90
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,959
already mentioned it uses the isomer as

91
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,679
core framework

92
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,959
because uh it brings some facilities

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,159
that are really useful

94
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,840
in building such a tool there's a

95
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,159
web front end which you can use to

96
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,200
configure various parameters of your

97
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,879
operation

98
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,720
and it's got live previews and you can

99
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,959
use it as renderer but it's also got the

100
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,239
full power of the isomer back end as in

101
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,280
modularity and

102
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,040
components um let's see i think i have a

103
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,120
slide about that yeah we're getting into

104
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,679
the gritty details now

105
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,280
um so um the general idea of avio is

106
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,040
that everything is kind of like a

107
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,959
first-class citizen i'm not

108
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,239
really focusing on any aspect

109
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,959
specifically

110
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,319
every idea every part of it should get

111
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,079
the same attention

112
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,560
and be intermixable in any imaginable

113
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,040
way

114
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,839
some of these ways may don't make sense

115
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,280
others make

116
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,520
a lot of sense and the the

117
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,440
kind of like drive that you should have

118
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,159
when working with a suit is to try out

119
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,560
things

120
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,400
it's it's very experimental and

121
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,320
sometimes you you delve up on

122
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,320
very interesting things to do

123
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,400
the the overall system component

124
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,440
architecture allows to

125
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,560
combine various aspects of technology

126
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,000
together in

127
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,080
new and sometimes meaningful ways

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,479
it's much like pure data where you can

129
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,639
build graphs of components that

130
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,800
communicate with each other to achieve

131
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,440
certain specific goals

132
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,440
um plugins can be developed and built

133
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,639
with the isomer infrastructure in mind

134
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,560
so you have

135
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,680
some some general purpose tools for

136
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,120
communication

137
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,840
or network operations but also some

138
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,360
some simple components like a pygame

139
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,198
input component where you can use

140
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,199
sdl input devices

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,680
the the components are communicating by

142
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,080
event

143
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,080
based messaging so you just emit your

144
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,440
data and somebody else might pick it up

145
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,960
or might not

146
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,800
depends on what components you're

147
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,120
running but you can design

148
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,800
concise graphs and this allows

149
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,560
asynchronous handling which is very

150
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,600
important because i don't know when

151
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,479
there's some

152
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,000
midi input coming or some joystick input

153
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,758
everything happens on the fly

154
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,440
so everything needs to be processed as

155
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,880
such this

156
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,520
also allows for very efficient

157
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,080
computation if you do it the right way

158
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,359
think of streams and then you're pretty

159
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,919
much set

160
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,479
um the the detailed user interface which

161
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,280
is not

162
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,560
really performance oriented it runs in a

163
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,679
web browser

164
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,080
by web server so you can fine-tune

165
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,199
things or load configuration data or

166
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,159
whatever

167
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,080
but but this is not meant immediately as

168
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,280
performance interface i'd like to

169
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,919
to get the computer out of the way when

170
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,520
i'm i'm

171
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,400
performing as as musician so

172
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,318
this this is just for setting up kind of

173
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,880
like

174
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,560
um to actually be able to do something

175
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,800
with our view you

176
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,759
need to need a little bit more than just

177
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,120
uh maybe input and output components

178
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,919
there's a multitude a really

179
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,600
a real bunch of components for different

180
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,479
kinds of things to do

181
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,440
and i come up with some ideas every few

182
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,000
months

183
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,440
just recently i built a beat counter

184
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,599
which can allow you to

185
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,840
synchronize better to music or a

186
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,319
joystick interface for switching presets

187
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,919
for example

188
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,000
so there's lots of batteries already

189
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,120
included we have human interface

190
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,880
device support for game pads joysticks

191
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,759
analog sensors in them

192
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,120
like i was i was very astonished to find

193
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,160
out that

194
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,280
certain game pads although they look

195
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,919
like they have buttons

196
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,638
those are analog buttons so you you get

197
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,280
26

198
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,240
analog inputs on one of these

199
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,638
controllers

200
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,280
for example there's also cameras and

201
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,360
other opencv based sensors available

202
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,559
and we have midi input and output via

203
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,880
via

204
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,639
pygame but i'm working on other

205
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,960
solutions as well so you can communicate

206
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,800
with jack immediately

207
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,159
there's also an oc library that are

208
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,400
integrated so you can

209
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,919
get data from oc controls or send them

210
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,919
out

211
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,599
you can obviously import and export

212
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,960
various file formats

213
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:54,000
i'm working a lot with animated

214
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,479
image sequences like gifs but i also

215
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,199
loaded videos already

216
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,240
and there's all sorts of of weird stuff

217
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,879
um

218
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,319
that might come in useful depending on

219
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,680
what you're doing on

220
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,800
on what you already have and it's easily

221
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,199
extendable

222
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,879
like you can write a protocol adapter in

223
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,479
less than 10 minutes and

224
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,440
it's good to use so one interesting part

225
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,599
is the output

226
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,039
like we talked about lots of inputs how

227
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,240
do you output the

228
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,919
result well with the data buses it's

229
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,599
pretty easy you just send out some midi

230
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,758
clock or data or some

231
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,520
some other control information but

232
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,719
sometimes or very often you want to

233
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,199
render video data for example

234
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,080
this can be done in future this i'm

235
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,919
working on this

236
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,760
with the phaser i o library in the

237
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,399
javascript front-end so you have some

238
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,640
some

239
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,760
rendering head that runs in your browser

240
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,519
and can make

241
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,920
use of 3d surfaces or 2d arts and

242
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,720
you can play back sounds and music if

243
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,519
you want to or

244
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,399
you could stream audio from the audio

245
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:01,600
server itself

246
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,360
talking about server is it's obviously

247
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,720
very strongly attached to network

248
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,880
devices so you can

249
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,760
have multiple machines running on your

250
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,080
system

251
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,519
and have one dedicated to this task one

252
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,360
dedicated to that task

253
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,440
and they can communicate with each other

254
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,399
and exchange meaningful information

255
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,120
like scenery control data or something

256
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,959
but this

257
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,519
mostly needs to be built by hand because

258
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,560
there's not much infrastructure yet to

259
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,040
automate these kind of things um

260
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,599
while i was playing around with mixing

261
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,439
video sequences for our mater light

262
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,279
i don't know if we can sweep the camera

263
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,800
to that maybe but

264
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:42,720
you you yeah someone

265
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,240
can do that quickly it's a 16 by 40

266
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,640
pixel

267
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,519
light some people may have known this

268
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,360
may know this for

269
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,560
for some years already it has been at

270
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,880
congresses

271
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,839
and it was one of my prime output

272
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,760
examples

273
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,920
because the mixing video information for

274
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,480
this tiny display is really

275
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,319
you can even do that in php or in basic

276
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,079
or in shell script and people are doing

277
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,120
it and there's actually really nice

278
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,120
applications working with that and

279
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,160
it's so it's a perfect candidate for

280
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,800
other test

281
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,079
runs and i started mixing video

282
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,800
information i think

283
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,880
four or five years ago and and this this

284
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,160
was actually the the groundstone for the

285
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,519
audio framework

286
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,680
because um uh it started that way

287
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,680
uh but but at some time and point uh

288
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,519
when when i was really bugged off by

289
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,040
all those naysayers that python is too

290
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,800
slow i decided to just

291
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,599
increase the frame buffer a little bit

292
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,399
and take bigger input imagery

293
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,880
and mix that so i was mixing six to

294
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,240
seven

295
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,320
h full hd streams in python in real time

296
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,839
and i think that's pretty impressive

297
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,600
considering that there was no

298
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,240
optimization going on at all

299
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,720
i was just using numpy to transform

300
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,000
these

301
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,720
these matrices into each other and it

302
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,440
worked

303
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,399
um since then i've gotten many pointers

304
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,200
and input

305
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,000
on how to build a blazingly fast working

306
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,079
system

307
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,839
like there's approaches on doing this on

308
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,760
the graphics card ram

309
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,200
because with textures you can be so much

310
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,600
faster

311
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,440
and you could animate textures by just

312
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,480
rolling them by for example or this

313
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,120
these other approaches

314
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,560
many many interesting ideas came up from

315
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,160
some communities

316
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,920
and i hope to be able to add some of

317
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,959
those in the next few months

318
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,000
so we get yeah i have a fully fledged

319
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,119
video mixer

320
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,440
for uh full hd or even more resolution

321
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,320
capable

322
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,240
so um what did i do with that already

323
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,360
some stuff was just too good to not try

324
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,160
out and

325
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,399
some stuff stuck others other

326
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,640
experiments were not so successful

327
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,399
but let's let's check out some i already

328
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,480
mentioned the martellite mixer

329
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,120
i'm getting ahead of got ahead of myself

330
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,240
but this is really a nice tool and

331
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,000
i hope to to have a nice front end

332
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,920
for controlling the the vjn

333
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,600
functionality soon

334
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,279
i've been building something with a web

335
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,600
front end where you have uh

336
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,680
it's like a mixer deck and you can see

337
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,440
several slots and add more

338
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,719
more of those and you can also render

339
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,480
text inputs

340
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,959
text labels which is all preparation

341
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,720
work for a larger system that is capable

342
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:23,760
of not running on just 40 by 16.

343
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,079
then there was the virtual vibrato

344
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,800
with a sony six axis controller hello

345
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,800
sony that's

346
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,040
uh really nice that you developed and a

347
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,319
linux driver for your recent gamepads by

348
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,040
the way

349
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,160
they are not completely evil i love that

350
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,920
and

351
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,240
i was playing around with that unit a

352
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,639
lot because it allows you to get a lot

353
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,360
of

354
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,680
analog input and it's conveniently

355
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,399
already bite-sized so you can

356
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,040
just take it and translate it into midi

357
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,800
data

358
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,399
that was what i tried and then i hooked

359
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,680
it up with bitwix studio

360
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,839
and added some of those modulators to

361
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,560
the pitch frequency of a synthesizer

362
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,639
so i could with the accelerometer way by

363
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,920
shaking the gamepad i could play a

364
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,120
perfect vibrato

365
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,279
and i could tune it like you can shake

366
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,320
slowly you can shake fast you can

367
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:15,120
shake hefty or just small movements

368
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,760
it's very fine tunable it's like like

369
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,160
playing a

370
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,639
real vibrato with a real instrument but

371
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,279
you can add it to any aspect of your

372
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,839
synthesis

373
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,040
process uh you could also convert this

374
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,480
into

375
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,240
uh mixing data for for vjing for example

376
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,079
or you could just hot glue the

377
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,360
controller to your instrument

378
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,880
and then do some movement things on your

379
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,720
fx chain for example

380
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,199
it offers lots of possibilities and um

381
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,399
sadly i don't have too much time to to

382
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,439
try out new things

383
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:51,120
otherwise i i would probably be

384
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,000
doing wicked with it um so um

385
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,360
why am i focusing on this isomer aspect

386
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,199
because

387
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,360
the isomer framework is about to get

388
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,240
some upgrades in the next few months

389
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,040
that are really beneficial for avio as

390
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,040
well

391
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,760
like there will be pipes and buffer

392
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,920
tools for more protocols which are

393
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:14,079
not score related to avio but

394
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,920
are sharing common functionality with

395
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,719
other applications that were built with

396
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,360
isomer

397
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,199
for example we have added mqtt for the

398
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,240
sailors to get sensor data across

399
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,040
networks

400
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,120
this may be used as well for performance

401
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,279
situations

402
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,639
there's strong support for command line

403
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,680
tools which

404
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:37,120
may sound like it's not so relevant but

405
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,680
i catch myself quite often fine-tuning

406
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,720
stuff

407
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,399
with command line tools i wrote and

408
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,040
the comprehensive configurable web

409
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,360
access it allows to work

410
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,880
to collaboratively work on your

411
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,959
performance because

412
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,160
essentially this gives you over the

413
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,079
client server infrastructure it gives

414
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,360
you multi-user access to whatever you

415
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,880
you're doing

416
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,440
and people can fine-tune their aspects

417
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,439
of their show but they can completely

418
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,720
control everything if you want to you

419
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,199
can also limit that

420
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,440
by permissions but no we're artists

421
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,680
we're not limiting ourselves

422
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,720
um then there's this aspect of

423
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,880
peer-to-peer

424
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,920
uh with national based networking and

425
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,480
this this opens

426
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,719
whole new areas of performances for

427
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,120
large outdoor sceneries for example

428
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,000
and i'm i'm really wondering what the

429
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,880
community may

430
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,800
come up with and i hope you you you have

431
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,600
a look at this and maybe adopt it and

432
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,359
try out what you

433
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,240
what you can do um so i sure hope you

434
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,519
like isomer and avio by now and that

435
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,480
pretty much concludes my

436
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,600
talk uh maybe we have some community

437
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,759
questions going on

438
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,320
now perhaps never give up the hope

439
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,880
otherwise if not you can always find me

440
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,279
online

441
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,439
i'm riot at cbase.org i am right in the

442
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,560
free node and there's several other

443
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,839
channels

444
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,839
you can contact me over

445
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,440
so yeah i hope you enjoyed this talk as

446
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,759
well and

447
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,800
there will be another last talk from me

448
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,199
at 8 00 pm

449
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,880
this evening it's a german lecture and

450
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,160
it's about the leicester melda

451
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,360
where i will be presenting a social tool

452
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,639
to

453
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,399
get a better stronghold on illegal

454
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,680
activities around

455
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:27,839
layer stand vacancies of shared flats

456
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,839
thank you and have a good lc3

457
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:37,839
[Music]

458
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
bye

459
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,839
so

460
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,520
you
