00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,520
[Applause]

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,919
museum digitalized their exhibits

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,840
what that has to do with colonialism

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,320
racism or sexism

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,840
is what lukas fuchscoper will talk to us

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,240
about in his talk

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,080
which in a somewhat provocative way is

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,439
called how can we prevent

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,680
the digital museum or stop it in

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,440
a research compound he is researching at

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,360
the technical university of berlin about

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,559
ethical questions of digitalization in

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,960
museums

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,199
and his hypothesis is that the

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,039
preservation of the digital

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,239
legacy becomes a farce

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,199
and that the progressive of

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,199
interpretation

20
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,360
is relevant in the digital space as well

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,440
and we are welcoming him with a

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,760
virtual applause lucas the stream is

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,160
yours

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,239
yes my name is lucas fuchscooper and i

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,640
work at the technical university of the

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,119
lane

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,280
about aspects of digital digitalization

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:13,520
in the museum

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,479
and this talk was prepared by me for

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,240
this ccc event it is directed at the

31
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,200
critical digital

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,039
scene so what are we going to talk about

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,840
the topic are digital museums

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,320
and that is various things for one thing

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,119
digitalized clinic collections

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,880
objects in museums that are photographed

37
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,439
scanned

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,439
but also the digitalized documentation

39
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,919
so the archive information about objects

40
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,520
which are digitalized and that are

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,079
turned into metadata

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,560
and it will be about digital

43
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,279
communication

44
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,560
or presentation of objects and the

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,759
metadata

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,759
and the focus will be

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,439
the scene that is listening

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,720
and museum employees so let's start with

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,400
museums in lockdown

50
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,160
in the coronal crisis locations had to

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,640
close down

52
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,599
including museums of course and the

53
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,079
focus very

54
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,359
quickly turned to social media formats

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,560
and their digital offerings

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,239
and an often used hashtag was closed but

57
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,000
opened so the museums are closed but

58
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,519
they are still open the austrian

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,599
journalist

60
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,200
didn't get the name summarize it very

61
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,238
nicely the way it felt to her

62
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,839
and i quote in my instagram feed

63
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,160
for the first time i have a man in a

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,599
suit explaining art to me

65
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,200
end quote another image of museums in

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,160
lockdown that i found very telling

67
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,799
were dj's in museums another popular

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,920
image and we see a dj here

69
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,200
in front of the dinosaur skeleton in the

70
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,920
berlin museum

71
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,799
of natural science which was taken from

72
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,839
tanzania

73
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,840
a german colony at the time to berlin

74
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,720
to lock down what was the feel

75
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,359
during lockdown empty museums of course

76
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,400
digital formats that were often used

77
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,360
with the

78
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,239
google arts and culture projects from 10

79
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,239
years ago

80
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:28,319
when google had 360 degree cameras

81
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:31,200
which they let go through the museums

82
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,119
and you could click through those and

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,238
look at those images so kind of

84
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,280
doubling of duplication of the museum

85
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,400
you couldn't touch you couldn't

86
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,040
contribute

87
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,840
it's void of people a very traditional

88
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,319
image of a museum or concept looking

89
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,959
back to this old project

90
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,238
when google was very influential

91
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,640
concerning digitalization in museums

92
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,360
a critical reminder could be that they

93
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,238
should not be repeated in this way

94
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,280
we shouldn't let the large tech

95
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,040
corporations

96
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,720
control our museums for themselves

97
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,879
because as we know

98
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,080
google is trading in data and we

99
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,359
shouldn't uh

100
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,160
gift any more data to them

101
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,919
the lockdown which is what i'm going to

102
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,600
that which is my conclusion of this

103
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,520
at the beginning is something that gives

104
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,080
us a new perspective on

105
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,639
digitalization in museums we can take

106
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,880
stock

107
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,560
because of that because what we see now

108
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,639
is nothing that is newly produced it

109
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,680
represents what museums

110
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:40,000
have done in the last few years and that

111
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:44,639
includes new projects new

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,080
funding was available to

113
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:51,199
support new projects so the museum 4.0

114
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,719
4.0 project was recently extended that

115
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,960
is

116
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,040
an alliance of museums that are trying

117
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,520
out new projects virtual reality

118
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,680
artificial intelligence perhaps and a

119
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,120
lot there is about personalization

120
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,919
of your digital visit so for us that

121
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,240
means

122
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,599
at the end of 2020 this is a very good

123
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,360
point in time

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:17,039
to look at what is happening

125
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:21,039
before we talk about the digital

126
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:23,520
samples specimens let's talk about the

127
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,719
debates the controversy about museums

128
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,198
they're in the focus focus

129
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,520
of a debate about remembrance culture

130
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,400
and new museum

131
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:35,520
museumology how is this

132
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,599
presented who controls what is presented

133
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,280
and who is excluded as well

134
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,479
the international museum's

135
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,479
council icon

136
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,000
collected 250 definitions of museums

137
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,120
from its members

138
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,199
and then started in exchange of what

139
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,840
museums are in the

140
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,319
in the view of society these days so

141
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,719
from the

142
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,160
collection and preservation and

143
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,280
presentation aspect

144
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,720
we are approaching formats of

145
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,039
participation and for some people this

146
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,479
definition was too political

147
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,400
and too much a reaction to the pressure

148
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,120
from social movements and that is true

149
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,599
to some extent these social movements

150
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,440
and and

151
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,520
the progress that is made of course is

152
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,880
due to pressure from outside

153
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,440
so how can we now

154
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,639
have a critical debate about the digital

155
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,479
formats

156
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,600
the first example that i'm going to

157
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,560
point to is feminist museum critique

158
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,560
the popular group gorilla girls for

159
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,720
example points to

160
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,360
i've which i've included here they point

161
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,240
very few female artists are exhibited

162
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,599
and very often

163
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,080
the models that are depicted are female

164
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,719
now what does this kind of criticism

165
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,318
lead to

166
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,639
in museums if we

167
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,039
visit a museum despite of this criticism

168
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,240
we keep encountering these narratives

169
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,280
that

170
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,400
have male artists genius and their

171
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,679
female muse

172
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:19,919
that inspires them one example

173
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:23,840
is paul gagan and his 13 year old wife

174
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:27,599
who was married to him in tahiti

175
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:31,758
and looking at a picture of this

176
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:35,440
13 year old wife i asked myself

177
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,440
how is this story told

178
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,599
the story behind the picture and in a

179
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,199
cultural context

180
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:47,039
these problematic images are normally

181
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:51,280
decontextualized image files

182
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:54,240
i have a file that i took from wikimedia

183
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,280
it has the name of the painter in its

184
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,639
title

185
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:02,559
and the title that he gave his work

186
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,360
and the whole problematic story is lost

187
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,479
looking at the museum's website the

188
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,039
museum that owns

189
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,400
this picture you don't even find that

190
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,400
picture in the database so i

191
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,840
can't know how it is presented there but

192
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,799
what i'm going to say is that the

193
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,080
file name and the presentation is not

194
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,160
neutral

195
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,919
a certain context contextualization

196
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,919
would be necessary

197
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,960
and the next example which we are going

198
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,960
to do with

199
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,198
a bit more length is the topic of

200
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,159
museums and colonialism

201
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,000
so the acquisitions that museums made in

202
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,039
colonial times and in the colonial

203
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,279
context

204
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,958
and for decades there have been demands

205
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,159
for restitution

206
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,119
by local actors who said that the

207
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,680
acquisitions

208
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,399
made in the colonial context are unjust

209
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,279
and

210
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,120
the work should be returned to the

211
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,519
original places

212
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,360
and a demand that was very important

213
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,760
here is the one

214
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,640
about archive transparency so to

215
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,920
actually know

216
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,839
what museums here actually hold

217
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,079
these lists have to be transparent and

218
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,080
accessible

219
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,600
because only these lists make it

220
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,200
possible

221
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,040
to raise demands and digitalization in

222
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,200
museum archives becomes very important

223
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,000
here because that is the foundation for

224
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,000
such demands

225
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,920
the question of course is what can we

226
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,040
contribute

227
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,079
these lists are simply scans very often

228
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,040
or photographed papers so as

229
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,480
a digital community we could actually

230
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,120
process these lists

231
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,279
and enrich them and link data from

232
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,160
various sources and that can be a very

233
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,480
practical

234
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,519
political act of solidarity so it's not

235
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,560
enough to just wait

236
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,320
until museums have to

237
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,279
take an action we can contribute

238
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,720
something ourselves

239
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:58,800
i'd like to take a step back and ask

240
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:02,000
how the offerings look that we can

241
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,040
see by now and one

242
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,839
example that i'm going to mention are

243
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,079
virtual visits this is a concept by the

244
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,959
journalist kwame opoku

245
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,839
and in my understanding this is an

246
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,040
interface

247
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:20,240
study he visits museum websites and

248
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:24,240
looks how easily he can reach

249
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,040
information about cultural goods

250
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,920
his example are the bronze bronze

251
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,439
sculptures from

252
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,079
benin in africa

253
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,120
so a large amount of bronze sculptures

254
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,239
in the kingdom

255
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,560
that that was looted from the kingdom of

256
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,760
of benin in the 19th century by the

257
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,319
english and that

258
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,880
now is in various museums and his

259
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,880
approach

260
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,439
is to go to a website of a museum that

261
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,120
holds these bronze sculptures and he

262
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,600
then tries to find something out he

263
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,680
finds information on on this and

264
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,160
documents what he finds how easy is it

265
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,519
to visit the museum digitally

266
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:07,360
and to find the context of these

267
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,640
sculptures and what i'm going to do with

268
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,519
you now

269
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:16,560
is to visit the state museums of berlin

270
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,200
with the intention to

271
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,760
find another perspective on the data and

272
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,640
the way

273
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,439
delta is dealt with regarding those

274
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,600
benin bronze sculptures

275
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,800
you can see here on the left how i

276
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,360
visit the website of the state museums

277
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,399
of the berlin state museum

278
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,720
and i'm going to the

279
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,000
database on that collection of their

280
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,240
collection and i use

281
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,200
benin as a search phrase and i then

282
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,760
wrote down what i've

283
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,880
found so i'm going to read this to you

284
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,079
now

285
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:55,120
one of the 255 works that i can find

286
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:58,399
from benin in the collection

287
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,680
of the berlin museums this is

288
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,040
information i found we

289
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,519
are on the website smb hyphen digital

290
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,079
state

291
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,160
berlin state museum's prussian cultural

292
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,120
heritage online database of the

293
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,959
collection

294
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:16,720
the address in the address bar tells us

295
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,119
that we are on the interface of e-museum

296
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,200
plus

297
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,200
so that is a database on collections

298
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,800
what does the actual the individual

299
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,440
objects look like or the way it is

300
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,519
presented we have an image on the left

301
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,880
of the sculpture then we have a title a

302
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,760
category

303
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,160
telling us that it is a sculpture and we

304
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,800
see that it it was

305
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,279
conveyed by a company but how and and

306
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,319
where

307
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,040
we do not know and there is information

308
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,839
on the

309
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,079
original which is unclear and the

310
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:52,320
country nigeria and the kingdom of benin

311
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:54,239
are mentioned we find measures and

312
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,920
an inventory number which is very which

313
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,680
is very important so

314
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,519
that is the number which which with

315
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,560
which the museum has registered the

316
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,560
object

317
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,160
and the fact that it belongs to the

318
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,119
berlin collection we also have a

319
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,040
copyright remark on the photo

320
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,720
in the photo metadata itself we have a

321
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,800
creative commons license which is kind

322
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,120
of contradictory

323
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,719
after these two columns we have an area

324
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,279
further down which tells us something

325
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,079
about

326
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,720
benin in the 16th century and the way it

327
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,479
is

328
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,920
interpreted visually what is the

329
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,680
official expression how that should that

330
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,920
be interpreted and the like

331
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,519
and if we click on other bronzes in the

332
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,680
collection the

333
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,200
picture is the same copyright creative

334
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,439
commons

335
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,440
as the mediator and

336
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,839
no year of acquisition that made me

337
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,279
curious i wanted to know

338
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,440
whether i can see any better

339
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:49,120
documentation using the

340
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,760
inventory number i can quickly find this

341
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,079
object in wikipedia and that has a date

342
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,519
of acquisition which is 1901

343
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,040
sadly without a source but we can add

344
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,440
the source later on because i found

345
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,319
something else

346
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,880
also i can find the signature in the

347
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,800
german

348
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,399
library the national library the digital

349
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,079
library

350
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,800
this is a database where scientific

351
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,839
institutions feed in their data

352
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,800
and other fields from the museum

353
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,680
database

354
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,800
are to be found here we have related

355
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,359
objects

356
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,359
we have

357
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,479
a link back to the same platform on the

358
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,079
website of the state museum

359
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,079
and if we click on that

360
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:44,560
we reach a file on the acquisition

361
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,800
sadly without a scan

362
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,319
there is no current image that is all

363
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,560
defined on this file

364
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,760
this file cannot be found to this search

365
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,680
mask

366
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,000
switch form on the website if i enter

367
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,880
the inventory number i can only find the

368
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,279
bronze head

369
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,519
itself so the interface is very limited

370
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,600
only using details we have the internet

371
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,480
can we find that extra information

372
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,360
but politically this is very significant

373
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,560
difference

374
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,639
very much because we find a sculpture

375
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,518
from the 16th century that

376
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,639
conveyed in the one exhibit and in the

377
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,440
other place we find

378
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,920
that this took place a few years after

379
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,519
the

380
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,439
english mission punishment mission and

381
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,800
and

382
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,800
that is very different information

383
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,839
what we can see here is that the

384
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,518
curators of the museums are managing

385
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,800
huge amounts of digital

386
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,759
copies and

387
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,160
digitized documentation and this is uh

388
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,800
full

389
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,800
of imperial liabilities

390
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,199
we should uh look at this duplication

391
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,800
quit critically and ask them did

392
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:05,040
anything change about the presentation

393
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:09,040
and how is the violence history of these

394
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,519
objects being told

395
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,959
the criticism that i mentioned that is

396
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,959
coming from outside museums

397
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,480
where war and colonialism is the context

398
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,319
of the

399
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,959
acquisition of the objects has to be

400
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,199
shown alongside the objects and if

401
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,758
museums would provide these links then

402
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,199
our role can be to create provisional

403
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,839
links for example

404
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,839
in platforms such as wikimedia

405
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:46,240
another example for present and

406
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,160
the future of digitization in museums is

407
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,279
the humboldt forum which you've probably

408
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,399
heard

409
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:55,759
behind the facade of the

410
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:59,759
berlin palace there's a going to be a

411
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:05,839
large museum with an ethnological

412
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,839
collection and a an exhibit on berlin

413
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,480
this humboldt forum contains

414
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,880
several digital projects this ranges

415
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,520
from participative

416
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,400
production of knowledge with indigenous

417
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,639
populations

418
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,319
all the way to gamification and

419
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,000
personalization those are going to be

420
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,480
the two examples which i'd like to show

421
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,480
you today

422
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,520
the first of these is a project which is

423
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,039
called

424
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:39,280
sharing knowledge and it

425
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:42,879
was created before the humboldt

426
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,240
forum in a humboldt lap but it's still

427
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,559
being

428
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,440
quoted as a prime example in the

429
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,639
humboldt lab

430
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:55,039
and it

431
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,440
wanted to confront existing knowledge

432
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,240
of in these collections with a new

433
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,679
perspective

434
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,720
and my analysis is as follows i was only

435
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,640
able to analyze this website through

436
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,559
screenshots and publications because

437
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,919
it's been offline for a while and it

438
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:15,360
is not mirrored anywhere the project

439
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:18,160
took surveys and conducted them

440
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,080
locally with the indigenous population

441
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,720
those were then digitized and presented

442
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,918
on the website and this website was then

443
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,520
taken back to these places that

444
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,280
didn't have a sufficient internet

445
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,559
connection

446
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,960
whether this knowledge made its way into

447
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,280
the

448
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,280
databases of the museums i don't know

449
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:45,280
if i compare one of these surveys

450
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,559
with the smb digital database

451
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,200
i have reason to believe that um these

452
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,639
data

453
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,160
weren't taken into the databases

454
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,160
because you can use the signature to

455
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,200
link it back

456
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,400
this external website which isn't linked

457
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,720
to the um database where these

458
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,760
data were presented is unfortunately

459
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,840
offline but

460
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,280
still they're advertising it quite a bit

461
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,199
quite a bit

462
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,039
but we can't um conduct any kind of

463
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,240
virtual visit

464
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,000
ironically this project is now

465
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,160
more easily available on the ground

466
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,400
without a internet connection

467
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,400
than it is here it's

468
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,360
i'm really curious what's going to

469
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,240
happen next

470
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,639
if these new critical data are going to

471
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,799
be merged with the

472
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,280
old existing data but as long as that

473
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:49,200
doesn't happen

474
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:52,240
we can support it by systematically

475
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,919
finding and supporting uh

476
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,600
compository knowledge and merging and

477
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,799
linking these various sources of

478
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:04,000
knowledge critically

479
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,960
the humboldt forum had to postpone its

480
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,080
opening

481
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,600
and a while ago it conducted a digital

482
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,639
opening via stream

483
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,639
and at this digital opening they

484
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,799
presented various other digital formats

485
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,158
which i'd like to present to you now

486
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,158
these digital formats

487
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,559
are usually conceived of as

488
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,240
returning to the physical space through

489
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,720
screens for example

490
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,080
and one of the examples they showed was

491
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,320
this

492
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,520
interactive skull of fish which is

493
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,760
supposed to represent

494
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,000
scientific research but also social

495
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,760
interaction

496
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,400
and the projects that were presented

497
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,919
contained two central layers of

498
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,080
presentation one of these is

499
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,559
gamification and personalization and the

500
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,678
other

501
00:20:52,559 --> 00:21:00,639
is a digital story returning you can

502
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,640
by the way watch this opening online

503
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,000
digital storytelling is quick to explain

504
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,918
the humboldt forum is conducting media

505
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,240
work and

506
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,960
young and old people are supposed to

507
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,640
produce

508
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,720
videos for digital empowerment

509
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,080
the next example is a bit more

510
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,600
interesting

511
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,399
in an exhibit at the humboldt forum

512
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,600
which is called

513
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,960
berlin global you could get a bracelet

514
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,678
which contains a

515
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,799
chip and as you walk through the

516
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,640
exhibition it

517
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:41,600
stores certain decisions that you make

518
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,440
the topic of the exhibit is berlin

519
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,639
global and it

520
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,600
tells of free freedoms

521
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,159
and borders and if you walk through this

522
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,280
exhibit

523
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,880
and um if you've allowed them to

524
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,240
track you then at the exhibit you'll get

525
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,760
a print out of your personal profile and

526
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,320
you're then supposed to meet other

527
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,559
people outside the exhibition and

528
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,120
discuss your results and give them to

529
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,678
the archives

530
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,959
and in the way it was made it reminds me

531
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,799
of a different

532
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,679
project in the same context of the

533
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,679
humboldt forum

534
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:25,280
which was part of the museum

535
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,039
museum 4.0 program which is

536
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,480
about the digital strategies for the

537
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,600
museum of the future

538
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:36,240
and one of the projects here was

539
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:39,760
the humboldt cosmos in digital space

540
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,200
museum 4.0 is a very interesting example

541
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,480
and it's recently

542
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:48,799
been extended and this app the uh

543
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:52,320
humboldt cosmos in digital space

544
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:55,440
wants you to find your very own object

545
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,918
in physical space and it hasn't

546
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,679
there's an app which lets you find your

547
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,039
object

548
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,039
it looks a bit like a dating app

549
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,879
and you have to swipe through artworks

550
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,720
and tell it if you like them or not and

551
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,840
once the app has collected enough data

552
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,960
on you it sends you to your

553
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,799
work of art and in this video the

554
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,840
developer

555
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,840
presents it as a kind of blind date in a

556
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,840
museum

557
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,039
what they have in common these two

558
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:34,000
projects

559
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:36,960
is a playful visit to museum

560
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,960
that you're supposed to let them track

561
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,240
you and get a personalized museum

562
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,279
experience

563
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,799
and this way of visiting or playfully

564
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:50,240
visiting a musee museum with an app

565
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,240
it redefines um the

566
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,679
participation in the museum and the

567
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,520
social interaction in the museum

568
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,159
participation

569
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,158
turns into

570
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,439
into a kind of tinder or grinder that

571
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,840
you can walk through and we see a very

572
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,960
strong

573
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,840
influence of certain trends in the

574
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,520
digital economy of the past decade

575
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,600
tracking personalization

576
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:18,639
gamification and

577
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,320
to me it's important to have a critical

578
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,679
perspective on this or to provide a

579
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:28,080
critical perspective

580
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:32,240
on the politics of digital presentation

581
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:35,360
and one reading suggestion

582
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,679
is um the text in the facebook aquarium

583
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,080
by

584
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,960
the hippolyta collective where they

585
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,720
describe how

586
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,440
gamification and personalization

587
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,440
technologies

588
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,200
lead to a certain way of social

589
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,200
interaction

590
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:56,879
if i were to speculate i would say that

591
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:00,080
the history of this project

592
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,720
is the cultural influence of such as

593
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,720
facebook

594
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,158
such as facebook google with youtube

595
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:13,120
over the past decade and we can see that

596
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,159
social media departments in museums are

597
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,439
more strongly involved

598
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,360
in presentation these days and so

599
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,720
participation in museums is being

600
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,559
redefined

601
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,760
as social media interaction this became

602
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:29,039
very obvious during the lockdown where

603
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,480
guided tours were conducted through

604
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,919
instagram or youtube

605
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:37,840
and the data servers of these large

606
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:42,799
data trade companies were being used

607
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:45,678
they have a monopoly

608
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,200
we saw in the next step is that this

609
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,200
logic of personalization

610
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,720
and tracking which was established by

611
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,080
this corporation

612
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,240
is now going back into the museums

613
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,799
and being turned into concepts of

614
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,799
presentation

615
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,679
what can uh what can we do and what can

616
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,760
the

617
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:15,360
online community do i think it's

618
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,559
most important that we talk about the

619
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,199
social internet

620
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,240
instead of social media it's about

621
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,799
technical

622
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,360
technology technological sovereignty

623
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,960
about

624
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,080
digital networking and the defense of

625
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,120
open standards

626
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,678
so cultural data and objects online

627
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,479
need to be linked we can't simply take

628
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,080
what we have

629
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,919
and then replicate it online scan it

630
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,520
digitize it in some way but we also have

631
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:45,039
to

632
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,120
link critically link certain resources

633
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,200
this is not just about colonialism but

634
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,239
also about

635
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:55,360
art and the history of

636
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,880
of violence and injustice and one

637
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,000
strategy for us could be

638
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,960
to to support

639
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,440
more sustainable interfaces such as

640
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:10,000
wikimedia or wikipedia

641
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,039
the example of the humboldt forum was

642
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,520
only meant to show

643
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:18,320
that concrete drafts of a

644
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,679
of the museum of the future exist now

645
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,320
and i would plead

646
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:28,000
to look for counter perspective

647
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:32,000
in existing criticism of museum and our

648
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,679
contribution could be to

649
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,720
link that to um ethical questions and

650
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,279
open standards

651
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,880
because otherwise we must be afraid that

652
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,720
the digital museum

653
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,600
simply overtakes um these debates that

654
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,840
we should have

655
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,840
thank you

656
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,200
we have one question about the context

657
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,440
of

658
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:03,840
digitized objects can metadata

659
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,840
be any

660
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,320
yes and that would be a good question to

661
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,080
those museums how much of what they know

662
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,520
about the objects do they actually

663
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,678
communicate to the outside the

664
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,879
providence research in the last few

665
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,640
decades

666
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,120
has of course gained importance in

667
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,000
museums and

668
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,879
i believe that my perspective on this

669
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,039
question would be

670
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,399
that different places

671
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,240
create different kinds of knowledge

672
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:42,479
about objects in the various

673
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:45,360
databases in the center for cultural

674
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,679
loss or other centers in different

675
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,000
places countries

676
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,080
up to the knowledge that exists in the

677
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,120
original places where these objects come

678
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,918
from

679
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,719
and it's not about asking for mandatory

680
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,760
fields but

681
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,360
more to say if we

682
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,679
don't have these mandatory views

683
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,240
couldn't we create places for that same

684
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,200
information

685
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,799
elsewhere for example in wikipedia in

686
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,960
wikimedia could we collect this

687
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:14,240
information there which is

688
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,720
scattered through across the net

689
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,240
so let's not wait for the museums or the

690
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,600
perfect technology

691
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,880
but rather get active and

692
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:28,240
act in solidarity

693
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,399
practice solidarity and would such a

694
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,440
digital museum not be a place for an

695
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:36,719
experiment for

696
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:39,279
curate curating an exhibition completely

697
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,039
by swarm intelligence and see what comes

698
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:44,559
out of that

699
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,360
well maybe the question is what does to

700
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,840
curate

701
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,799
mean these days who has control about

702
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,678
that

703
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,320
there are many formats for participation

704
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,600
and many

705
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,678
exhibitions that are conducted using

706
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,480
participation which you could

707
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,440
call swarm intelligence but ultimately

708
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,480
it is about the

709
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:08,159
social interaction that the museum

710
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:11,679
enables the exchange that it allows

711
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:14,399
and it's about all parts of a museum not

712
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,760
about just curating but also documenting

713
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,559
it's about the knowledge that is

714
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,879
connected to the museum's collections

715
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,320
and what they do in an exhibition and in

716
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,360
the digital area

717
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,360
the thing is that their activity there

718
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,120
affects all the other areas much much

719
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,279
more

720
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,399
databases were curated as well and that

721
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,679
they are

722
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,678
so full of liabilities

723
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,840
an effective way for the critical public

724
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,840
to get interfered

725
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
okay

726
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,799
who drives the digitalization forward

727
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:10,000
there are there is

728
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:13,039
funding for research um there are funds

729
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,039
for digitization

730
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:24,320
in the past decade a lot has happened

731
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:28,240
and a lot of money was provided and um

732
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:31,439
a lot of prototypes were created but

733
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,360
as to who drives digitization that's not

734
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,200
really answerable for all museums

735
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,399
because there are so many of them

736
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,039
so that's why i took these

737
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,639
large examples in my presentation where

738
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,799
several museums

739
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,159
cooperate and say that they're they're

740
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,960
developing the presentation of the

741
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,080
future

742
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,919
or the humboldt forum which is um

743
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,080
experimenting with a lot of digital

744
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,880
formats until it's opening next year

745
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,480
so i would like to advertise for um for

746
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,840
being a critical voice

747
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,840
in this exchange

748
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,440
pad tells about the about a

749
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,159
national infrastructure for research

750
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,120
data which

751
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,159
wants to define common metadata for

752
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,918
objects and

753
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,919
somebody says

754
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:31,200
this is very much for

755
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,519
greek sculptures owner copies there is a

756
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,519
tradition of copying objects

757
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,279
in rome where many copies were made of

758
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,880
greek

759
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:45,440
sculptures but there's a question um

760
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,960
where is the money coming from well

761
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,000
there's a lot of money yes

762
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,880
um there are lots of projects that um

763
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,679
want to support

764
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,679
digitization

765
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,760
i'm not worried about that at all but

766
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,840
the question is what are the politics

767
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,679
behind this what programs

768
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,199
are behind it there's a lot of money

769
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,640
involved though

770
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:10,000
and as for the national

771
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:14,000
database of research

772
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,679
infrastructure a lot of discussions and

773
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,600
are happening in this in this area at

774
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,919
the moment but if we're

775
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,039
if we're going to have common standards

776
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,559
of metadata then i

777
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,559
want to know where they come from so

778
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:34,639
these data standards that exist

779
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:38,880
in cultural history have a vocabulary

780
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:42,159
from a past

781
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,799
lots of decades ago well these the terms

782
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,600
are

783
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:48,158
partly very racist and very problematic

784
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:53,840
and i'd be very careful

785
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,840
about it

786
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,880
establishing standards before we've been

787
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,918
able to critically analyze them

788
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,039
but if i i otherwise i think that's a

789
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,159
great idea to

790
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:08,320
create standards and

791
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,040
if we establish a culture of questioning

792
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,119
these old standards

793
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,159
yes the internet then thanks you for

794
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,560
this beautiful talk

795
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,200
which i would like to add myself my own

796
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,918
thanks to so there is some

797
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:35,839
uncovered applause thank you for the

798
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:35,839
questions too

799
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,839
wow

800
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,920
you
