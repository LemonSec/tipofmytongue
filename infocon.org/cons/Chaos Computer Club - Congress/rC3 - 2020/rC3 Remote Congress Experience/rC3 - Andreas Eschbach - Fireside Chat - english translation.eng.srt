yes also looking forward to two things

9
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:27,840
um and we have a place

10
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,840
today and there will be a short reading

11
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,439
we have a little more space a few people

12
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,200
can join in

13
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,279
it should be in the farther in the

14
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,040
schedule

15
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,799
and hopefully people will tell you

16
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,000
correct me no okay

17
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,320
it is in the far plan good

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,320
thank you

19
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,680
hello hello

20
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,680
[Laughter]

21
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,239
yeah well i've been sitting here for

22
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,239
some time

23
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,839
how long have you been writing have you

24
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,720
been doing that

25
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:37,840
since i've been 12 half a century ago

26
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,840
i was

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,640
so it translates quite nicely

28
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,280
and i also have it digitally on my phone

29
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,399
because i shouldn't have done text this

30
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:19,840
is my

31
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:19,840
my artist kindly

32
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,959
managed

33
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,400
played a huge role in the weimar

34
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,400
republic and also helped the nazis

35
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,840
when the nazis took power

36
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,639
over the agency that

37
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,040
between the people so money movements or

38
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,599
messagings

39
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,600
and the like

40
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,560
hitler also used

41
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,639
that many people didn't even know

42
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,520
existed from the

43
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,759
republic and they just took it over and

44
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:25,840
it

45
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:25,840
didn't change

46
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,479
so the nazis just assumed that it would

47
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,479
be ns

48
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:53,840
national and socialistic i didn't think

49
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,840
it had to be changed

50
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,880
this agency survived the war quite well

51
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,919
but today should be the change it

52
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,840
changed

53
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:07,840
october it was 5th october 1942.

54
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
morgan

55
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,280
as if someone had

56
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:18,319
put a grey cloak over it and

57
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,400
the windows of the agency looked like

58
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,400
a

59
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,520
there was almost no one on the streets

60
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,240
except for a few

61
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,240
cyclists

62
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,759
and the windows were barricaded just to

63
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,758
be sure

64
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,199
mercy dispense

65
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,719
stopped in front of the portal with

66
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,720
the wet

67
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,039
and

68
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,039
i welcome

69
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,840
he said

70
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,240
the room was dark a projector

71
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,520
showed a sharp image what's the belgium

72
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:03,039
for helena

73
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:07,280
ventilator was ventilating and

74
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:13,840
it was smelling of hot air a few

75
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,840
people were smoking

76
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,599
the first level is obvious we have

77
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,599
access to all kinds of

78
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,280
information and we can use that

79
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,560
information in many ways

80
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,919
we can read any text anyone writes

81
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,039
and every email sent within the

82
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:38,399
like we can see

83
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,519
all the account balances we can see

84
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:45,120
what news shows people

85
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:48,240
watch listen to

86
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,000
and of course we can read all forum

87
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,959
discussions even on

88
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,959
closed forums and

89
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,519
the problem is the sheer amount and mass

90
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,560
of data

91
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:17,920
we can read any document but we can

92
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:21,119
can't read them all we couldn't do that

93
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,079
even though even if we had

94
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,080
a thousand fold

95
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,600
employees of course

96
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,839
more employees wouldn't be impossible it

97
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,839
wouldn't be possible because of the

98
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,839
losses at war

99
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,880
we have artificial intelligence to

100
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,880
look

101
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,040
that's what i'm going to talk about

102
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,760
until now it's just scratching the

103
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,439
surface

104
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:24,800
the power of the computer

105
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,920
to interlink data

106
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,959
in a way that provides information that

107
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:35,120
is the second level of our

108
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:37,518
work and no one could do it like we do

109
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,320
and we would like to present some of

110
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:44,160
that information now

111
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,480
leaned back and folded his hand

112
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,480
hands

113
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,839
foreign

114
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
convenience

115
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,440
the black market and violent crime and

116
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,360
all that

117
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,360
adam nodded politely

118
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,480
those were the motives but that

119
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:14,000
wasn't was what motivated us

120
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,360
because we don't know

121
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,880
what everyone is doing whatever we know

122
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:25,839
what everyone's been doing

123
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:25,839
the past nine years what they bought

124
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,719
and lines containing numbers

125
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,800
fairly simple

126
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,760
here we see

127
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:02,639
all purchases i've made in the last year

128
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:07,839
it includes my personal id number

129
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,839
and the accounts the money went

130
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,839
you can see an example of that in the

131
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:26,160
second line that is my

132
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,160
rent and the last

133
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,639
line contains the quantity

134
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,839
programmed

135
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,279
whenever i bought food hamlet was

136
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,399
skeptical

137
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,600
how do you know but you know what is

138
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,680
food

139
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,600
the numbers are completely different

140
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,279
yeah you can't see that at the numbers

141
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,240
the numbers are just increasing

142
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,519
but whenever a number or an article is

143
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,680
added

144
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,000
all the information is in a different

145
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,000
table

146
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,880
please show the information to the first

147
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,880
row

148
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,079
one zero zero one seven four here we

149
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,800
have the category

150
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,239
that's food so if we want to have

151
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:45,839
further information

152
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:45,839
we have to check the table of foods

153
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
potato

154
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,279
700 calories per hundred grams i bought

155
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,160
two kilograms that'd be fine might i ask

156
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,160
how you know that yeah

157
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,750
but of course i'm not buying myself i

158
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:29,799
have a young helper who does that

159
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,799
[Music]

160
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,040
until he found his point again

161
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,360
as i said i bought two kilograms of

162
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,199
potatoes so

163
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:55,839
1540 calories

164
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,839
that calculate those calculations

165
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,429
[Music]

166
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:43,199
so august 1942 2149 calories

167
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,680
and further dates and further numbers of

168
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,680
calories

169
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,560
is what i bought and

170
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,000
nutrition values per household and then

171
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,720
we can divide

172
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,679
that by the number of people in the

173
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,520
household

174
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,959
and then we have a list of all

175
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,918
households

176
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:31,360
and how much each house each person

177
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,360
household is using per month

178
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,678
incredibly behind his glasses slowly but

179
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,840
they grew

180
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:49,120
he seemed to understand what this was

181
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:51,600
getting the same because i live alone

182
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,399
for other people the number will be

183
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,080
lower

184
00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:01,840
for example when there is a baby or a

185
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:01,840
child of course it's less than another

186
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,960
i would like to see a

187
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,440
nothing better than that just tell me a

188
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,039
city

189
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,039
and we will create a

190
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,840
is there a problem

191
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
is

192
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,039
amsterdam suddenly listening again

193
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,559
do we have all the information yeah yeah

194
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,600
so started

195
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,760
stop the analysis yeah of course

196
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,719
just like any good woman she was

197
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,600
following orders

198
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,320
and she was watching her hands putting

199
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,320
in the commands

200
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,760
and the tables were growing on the

201
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:02,799
screen

202
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,799
she was she felt like she could hear the

203
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,640
amsterdam

204
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,919
when our army took the netherlands and

205
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:27,120
could take a look at the data

206
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,120
we could tell that the city was having

207
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,480
tables about the religion of the people

208
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,158
already

209
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,600
they were doing it for texas but of

210
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:38,640
course it was great for us

211
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:42,080
unlike the homeland where we had to

212
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,720
put into put a lot of work into it

213
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,720
there we already had a list of all jews

214
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,679
which made our work a lot easier of

215
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,240
course

216
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,720
yeah yeah that's fine yeah that was a

217
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,919
really

218
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,080
nice piece of luck

219
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,200
yeah we started with the deportations of

220
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,280
course

221
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,520
because we have that list we know that

222
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,760
we didn't get every water

223
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,720
for some it was said that they went into

224
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,559
the

225
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,600
other countries we know that that can't

226
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,039
be true

227
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,280
so if they didn't swim across the sea

228
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,559
they have to be somewhere in the city

229
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,879
somewhere in the city

230
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,879
hidden in the hope that we will go away

231
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,840
putting a fist into the air

232
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,760
everyone was just staring at the number

233
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,120
on the screen that was slowly climbing

234
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,559
to a hundred percent

235
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:55,840
then it disappeared and the list came up

236
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,840
the first few numbers

237
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,480
what does that mean besides this these

238
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,880
people almost

239
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,000
buy three times the amount of that what

240
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,000
they can eat themselves

241
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:24,480
the numbers from civic tables

242
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,799
it felt like there was an incredibly

243
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,360
heavy and invisible weight on her

244
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,320
so happy she could barely breathe but

245
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,799
her hands

246
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:37,360
those traitors kept working typing

247
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,360
incredibly

248
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,840
without children

249
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,039
just in december right after we came

250
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,720
there

251
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:55,840
it changed the owners

252
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,840
that could be just a cover-up

253
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,760
helena opened the entries

254
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,760
is that a dutch name

255
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,919
fingers danced over the keyboard

256
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,960
frank wasn't a dutch man but a german

257
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,960
jew

258
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,840
and was last seen in 1942 in june

259
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,919
according to rumors the family had fled

260
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,880
to switzerland

261
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:43,840
for they haven't himmler said and

262
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,840
whipped out his phone

263
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,840
staring into the silence letting time

264
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,840
pla

265
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
pass

266
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,760
finally after 100 years at least that

267
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,799
was

268
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,760
what it seems like to helena the phone

269
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:48,879
rang

270
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:52,400
ring exactly him was listening

271
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,400
and he said nothing

272
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,840
hopefully nobody would notice how she

273
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,840
was relieved

274
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:24,240
i assume we also have the

275
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:30,000
um building data of course

276
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,000
show me the building on the map

277
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
yes

263.

281
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,840
described exactly what they had seen

282
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,840
there was a door

283
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,840
i went to the second

[Music]

285
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,120
no

286
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,879
behind the room there were supposed to

287
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,799
be more rooms

288
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:13,840
it was working incredible the tension

289
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,840
was incredible

290
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:30,720
it's fixed to the wall assume that

291
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:35,840
it's a rouge try again

292
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,840
hmm dss men said okay

293
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,080
commands and it was silent

294
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,840
very well

295
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:23,840
screaming women and children

296
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:51,840
send them to auschwitz immediately him

297
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,879
up

situation in the east

inside fund that is just as important

300
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,679
as our tanks on the outside front and

301
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,760
that is

302
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,880
about liberating the country from the

303
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,720
jews

304
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:48,159
he put his phone in his pocket

305
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,559
looked at the employees and said

306
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,120
i would have i didn't expect i wouldn't

307
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,360
have expected

308
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,559
what your work was able to do i thought

309
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,678
you were just some

310
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:04,000
small meaningless agency

311
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:07,279
but gentlemen you have convinced me

312
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,399
i see that you are fighting at a very

313
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:12,159
important front

314
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:15,678
that is as important as our

315
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:18,960
external war towards the outside

316
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:22,240
what i saw with you today convinced me

317
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,279
that no one will ever be

318
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:29,039
safe from us nowhere we will

319
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:31,760
soon have a right minorities

320
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,320
no longer exist our power will be

321
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,320
infinite

322
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:44,159
right afterwards stay brought

323
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,360
and his entourage to the cars

324
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:51,519
i saw what's up watch the black cars

325
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:54,840
go away right afterwards

326
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,490
tension flew into laughter

327
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:00,579
happiness

was producing the smile that everyone

330
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:17,679
was expecting

331
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,919
accepted the nice words because

332
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:25,840
they were all part of it she did it

333
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,840
automatically because she

334
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,120
hand over the man she loved more than

335
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,279
anything in the world

336
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,639
so to certain death these are still

and the extreme applause we will have to

342

just imagine right now technology

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,039
is not far enough

344
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,840
please don't let us reach 1984 with the

345
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:02,159

346
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,840
that's a different topic so yeah

347
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,840
checking the chat we see a lot of

348
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,840
applause

349
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:15,269
[Music]

350
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,839
um

351
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,560
we have nothing to hide

352
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,359
yeah it's really harmless data that's

353
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,560
collected just 77

354
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:45,759
calories per 100 100 grams of

355
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:49,040
potatoes can become dangerous and

356
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:53,200
actually prepared that quite well

357
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,199
how all these data work together

358
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,560
that's how the combination of data can

359
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,760
lead to a very

360
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:03,680
ugly end in the scene now

361
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:06,240
um do you maybe want to explain

362
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,680
or tell a bit about your background

363
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,000
knowledge where do you have that

364
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,000
haircut yes

365
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,960
i

366
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,320
and microsoft access and was working

367
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,040
with databases

368
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,520
i was programming sql and stuff like

369
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,839
that

370
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,839
and um

371
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,560
to take part in a course

372
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,160
or to provide a course to the topic of

373
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,279
data protection

374
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:51,598
so i was giving courses for databases

375
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:54,960
how to join and analyze the data

376
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:57,680
and just the idea of making a course of

377
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,680
giving a course

378
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,520
with database courses people

379
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,520
are typing in data and those are usually

380
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:10,240
addresses and then you

381
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,240
get out everyone from stuttgart and

382
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,839
everyone

383
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,400
really look for specific information and

384
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,920
you could use data

385
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,920
like you get in a company

386
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:39,040
for example data of when people arrive

387
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,760
or leave because back then that was

388
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,880
mostly

389
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:45,280
electronic already what they eat

390
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,880
and their brakes because the companies i

391
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,040
was working with

392
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,359
most of that was already with electronic

393
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,359
payments

394
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,880
and doing that you could have checked

395
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,320
who is always arriving at the same time

396
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,320
and what does that probably mean

397
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,760
are they maybe having an affair or are

398
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:09,839
they living in the same area

399
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,839
there is

400
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,839
that was what i imagined

401
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:44,720
so the comparison and analysis of data

402
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,720
of these lists

403
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:53,040
so that you can abuse data or use data

404
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,760
for more than it was meant for so you

405
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,279
want to know

406
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,839
what how many calories are in potatoes

407
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,359
or the

408
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:03,920
nutritional values of your food

409
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,560
and you want to know how well this food

410
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,480
is for you

411
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,320
but if you combine that with bad

412
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,839
intentions then you can get

413
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:15,440
different results yes combined with

414
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:18,400
changing politics it can happen quickly

415
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,960
as we could sadly see in different

416
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,079
places

417
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,079
of the world um

418
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,320
so you basically wrote a crossover

419
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,720
between snowden

420
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,720
and nazis nazis well

421
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,839
is

422
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,119
i visit amazon they are offering hiking

423
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,319
booths

424
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,320
so they know what i'm doing

425
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,079
that's possible but those are not bad

426
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,799
intentions yet

427
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,440
so amazon just wants to developing to

428
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,760
focus here

429
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,480
optimize the advertisement which might

430
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:24,240
be a legitimate practice

431
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:26,800
so they try to give you advertisements

432
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,720
that are interesting for you so they are

433
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,920
not trying to give

434
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,640
also printed out ads to people who have

435
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,640
no use for that

436
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,240
and also when i was working in that

437
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,240
company

438
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,480
don't and there are other poor people

439
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,359
you don't have to

440
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,160
have ads there and that's probably still

441
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,520
the same

442
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,759
i mean we have data protection but

443
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,440
that's only by the state

444
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,760
companies can still pretty much do what

445
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,640
they want and such things

446
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,160
and these maps are still available and i

447
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,000
was saying that's not the worst that can

448
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:19,839
happen

449
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,839
just imagine the nazis

450
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,839
they might have had our computers from

451
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,839
today

452
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:39,839
and yeah i kept thinking that

453
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,400
because usually such an idea is six

454
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,839
years old or older

455
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:58,800
at that was by rather than three years

456
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,799
and so yeah it was rather quick

457
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,720
i already had a lot of material of

458
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,000
course

459
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,640
but nazis usually have some books

460
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,640
in your bookshelf

461
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,359
it shouldn't really be a book about

462
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,040
nazis

463
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,620
there are others and better books about

464
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,739
that but it's a book about

465
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,739
[Music]

466
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:35,839
so the computers are the focus point

467
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,839
and what you can do with them within

468
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,480
the characters were also quite nice to

469
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,599
me right

470
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,240
because sometimes when you're writing a

471
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,359
character

472
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:00,560
that is creating itself basically

473
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:04,160
that's why and the two main characters

474
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,880
and helena they were basically creating

475
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,279
themselves

476
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,560
they are plastic they have their own

477
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,200
wants and goals

478
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,200
and problems

479
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,680
they are creating

480
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,880
you just have to think what are their

481
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,960
problems

482
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,880
just follow them and everything is

483
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,960
happening quickly

484
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,720
okay i'm very curious how you're

485
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,200
developing characters

486
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,399
but i have an interesting question from

487
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:40,078
the chat

488
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,079
maybe to that topic would it be okay

489
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,240
part of this reading is computer science

490
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,439
course

491
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:53,839
it would fit rather well yeah of course

492
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:58,720
so i show the book as well

493
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:58,720
so it can serve as an advertisement and

494
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,880
at the same time quite subtle and quite

495
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,040
obvious

496
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:20,240
so you combined that well yeah

497
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:27,839
i did want to make it obvious so

498
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:27,839
it's not a bad word in my context

499
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,760
sometimes you really wish for the big

500
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,359
hammer um

501
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,520
one question was what would that look

502
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,880
like today because now we have mobility

503
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,319
data and media data

504
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:51,359
contact data do you have an idea

505
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:52,839
how would you do that today in a context

506
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:55,839
that's not

507
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,839
released

508
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:10,640
because the political situation is

509
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:13,839
important about that because right now

510
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,839
we are in a democracy

511
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,880
we are allowed to do pretty much what we

512
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:20,839
want and

513
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:23,839
i think what we wanted but that can

514
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,839
change

515
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,839
and the problem is that that works

516
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,839
backwards because all the data is still

517
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,839
available

518
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,040
anything against us in the past and the

519
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,240
left and the religious people of course

520
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,640
are the same

521
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,839
all those who exactly know what god

522
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,480
wants or

523
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,480
destiny or whatever everyone who really

524
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,760
knows things for a fact

525
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,960
they have no mercy because they are

526
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,040
certain

527
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,040
and they can fight anyone who

528
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,119
so i'm happy about all the websites that

529
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,520
disappear again

530
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,920
but the big data blocks there are

531
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,920
numbers

532
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,400
an average american producers per day

533
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,880
and that's

534
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,000
crazy it's it's an insane amount and

535
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,760
google and facebook they

536
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:35,359
are collecting all of that and the nsa

537
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:40,079
also for sure and then the data is just

538
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:40,078
there and is waiting to be abused

539
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:49,040
like religious people might check the

540
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:53,359
church taxes from amsterdam

541
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,359
at least yeah that was a simple lisp

542
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,839
we didn't get extra

543
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:15,839
as an extra topic

544
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,640
well you had certain role models in that

545
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,319
book

546
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,839
that women were the mechanics and the

547
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:28,880
engineers and

548
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:32,640
men are the users and

549
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,640
those who draw the conclusions

550
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,720
that yeah that provide the direction and

551
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,649
all that

552
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,560
um

553
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:42,800
[Music]

554
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,799
two

555
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:53,200
to make it more plausible because i

556
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:56,960
want to have it realistic

557
00:46:53,200 --> 00:47:00,399
so yeah it's a mechanical engineered

558
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:06,160
computer we're using um

559
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:06,160
punch cards steam operators and all that

560
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,839
and then

561
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,079
lovelace who wrote the programs

562
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,200
even further than the inventor because

563
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:40,319
she was already thinking

564
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,319
tables and

565
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:46,000
geographical data and insurance and all

566
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,000
that

567
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:51,280
so she already knew that what you can do

568
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:55,040
with the numbers

569
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:58,960
so she already predicted digitalization

570
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:02,079
so with that

571
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,000
labor division men do the hardware and

572
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,800
women do the software

573
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,599
and the combination with adelovlas um

574
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,720
that was

575
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:13,599
my inspiration but also

576
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,279
during my studies um at the fraunhofer

577
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:18,640
institute where i worked as

578
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,880
a research assistant

579
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,558
we had women he programmed and that was

580
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,960
something remarkable

581
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,960
back then

582
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,240
yeah that was working against the

583
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,240
stereotypes

584
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,960
i i thought what they were doing was

585
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:49,520
pretty neat um

586
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:53,280
one of them built some sea routines

587
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:55,839
that i even copied i used them for a

588
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,839
long time

589
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:03,359
and what was special about that when men

590
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,359
program they always

591
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:20,720
without the added ego or at least that's

592
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:24,319
my opinion and i would have

593
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:31,330
loved to hire women for my

594
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:34,429
enterprise if i had had the possibility

595
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:34,429
[Music]

596
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,399
yes they just didn't find computers

597
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,640
fascinating enough

598
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,640
i guess

599
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:57,599
yeah that is also kind of an homage to

600
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,599
those women who um

601
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:15,279
um

602
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:18,480
i was talking i was thinking but many

603
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,480
people can't estimate that

604
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,439
well we have an interesting question

605
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,680
coming in

606
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,480
how do you do your research especially

607
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,680
about the future

608
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,520
other than what you know from your

609
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:36,480
studies do you ask people

610
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,520
who know about the subject of this

611
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,839
that's the story

612
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,839
and how do you make this story plausible

613
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,800
yeah the research

614
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,319
it's kind of like

615
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:59,359
yeah it's like the um work you have to

616
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,359
do

617
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:05,280
you list the questions list

618
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:08,640
the topics that you don't know about and

619
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:12,480
then you try to fill in the gaps

620
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,480
if you don't have books on it

621
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:19,040
which i often have because um yeah

622
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,319
i write about topics that i like anyway

623
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:25,599
so i have my literature about that

624
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:30,079
but if i don't i do my research

625
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:33,040
on books maybe i buy one or two books

626
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,040
or i borrow them

627
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,319
when i didn't have that much money i

628
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,720
always borrowed my books now i'm able to

629
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,720
buy them

630
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,920
also the library is far away

631
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:51,040
from pesos and i don't want to rely

632
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,599
i don't have to know what the weather it

633
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:12,960
was like in 1973 in new york

634
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:19,839
you won't find that information um

635
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:19,839
in a book but on the internet maybe

636
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:33,680
the quality of conspiracy theories is

637
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,319
declining

638
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,319
by the day

639
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,160
first i do my homework and then if i

640
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:51,599
still have questions

641
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,598
i look for experts

642
00:52:53,839 --> 00:53:00,960
which i often postpone because

643
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,960
well i'm not the most

644
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,799
i'm convinced that you need to do your

645
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:11,920
homework before you

646
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:14,720
pester experts and

647
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,720
highly doubted

648
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:20,160
so i don't want to be calling i don't

649
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,440
know

650
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:26,558
a nobel prize laureate and have

651
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,839
no idea what i'm even talking about so

652
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:32,480
i really take my uh research

653
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,480
seriously

654
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,319
because yeah you just have to

655
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,839
it's the same with traveling

656
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:53,839
because you can get an impression of

657
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:56,000
places what it looks like

658
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:57,599
and then you can connect that to you

659
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,119
your own impressions from your own

660
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:03,680
travels

661
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:06,880
but yeah booking a trip to australia

662
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:10,078
and then finding out well

663
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,079
the scenery isn't that good

664
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:20,960
because sometimes describing the scenery

665
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:25,839
is completely

666
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,839
useless for the plot

667
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:39,839
the ratio between planning research

668
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:53,839
yeah i tend to do less

669
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,839
research than i should and just

670
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,959
i'm always counting on my inspiration

671
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:07,839
and my muses

672
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,839
to um give me the right input

673
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,880
for the mains on this side yeah but

674
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:18,839
that also leads to mistakes so for

675
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,839
example when i

676
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:21,839
oh

677
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:36,240
this other author was having a coffee

678
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,960
mobile

679
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,959
with diesel so this author had no idea

680
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:48,880
your style are you changing are you

681
00:55:55,359 --> 00:56:03,839
do you want to answer directly or the

682
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:03,839
implied questions

683
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,839
reinventing yourself that sounds great

684
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:17,839
if you hear that about someone bob dylan

685
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:17,839
and reinvent themselves

686
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,720
if you can get a literature nobel prize

687
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,960
then you are a colleague

688
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:32,240
right this is

689
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,880
don't sit down and say i have to

690
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:38,319
reinvent myself

691
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:43,280
it's just that i always try to do the

692
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:47,040
story justice that means

693
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:50,799
i have very different ideas

694
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:52,799
and i invent

695
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:55,040
quite different stories because i just

696
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:55,599
can't bring myself to write the same

697
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,279
story

698
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,839
several times because that would get

699
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,839
boring

700
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,920
and they just are different

701
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,439
that's just in my dna

702
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,960
the other has

703
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:29,680
storytelling space but it doesn't

704
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:31,598
really feel like i'm trying to do

705
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,598
something different i just have ideas

706
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:35,760
and i try to do them justice but of

707
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:39,200
course the storytelling

708
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,200
is important as well sometimes

709
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,919
from the perspective of a 3 000 year old

710
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,920
englishman

711
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,280
so he is referencing perry rhoden now

712
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,440
this

713
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,359
is a very long-running german science

714
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:13,839
fiction story

715
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:16,640
that happens in small monthly episodes

716
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:18,000
and of course that is a very kind a very

717
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:22,640
different kind of story

718
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,640
if you have a 3 000 year old englishman

719
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,680
and yeah there was also the other story

720
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,000
about

721
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:34,078
humans who have wings and live in giant

722
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,599
trees

723
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,359
and that's basically the opposite of

724
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:40,559
technology and you have to

725
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:43,119
tell that story differently right

726
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:45,440
do you want to spoil that story a little

727
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,440
for us

728
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:54,959
i don't um well

729
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:57,040
my editor is saying whenever he gets a

730
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,559
new

731
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,240
whenever he gets a new manuscript well

732
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:05,839
that's something completely different

733
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:05,839
now um

734
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:14,000
a future far away in a galaxy far away

735
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:17,359
um

736
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,520
on a forgotten planet there are

737
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:21,279
people living there and humans who have

738
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:25,359
wings and they know why

739
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:28,559
because ancestors

740
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:30,640
who came to their planet gave them

741
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:32,640
the wings genetically because the ground

742
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:35,200
is dangerous

743
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,920
everywhere if you touch the ground it

744
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:39,279
can happen

745
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:41,520
that you die you don't know why

746
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,880
the ancestors also couldn't figure out

747
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,640
why

748
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,000
but at some point they said well let's

749
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:49,359
just give our children

750
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,680
wings and from that point on their wings

751
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:53,680
and were living in the skies and said we

752
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:56,558
don't care about the ground anymore

753
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,279
but not only the ground is inaccessible

754
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:01,440
but also

755
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:04,559
the sky the sky is the closest

756
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,839
cloud cover they don't have a word for

757
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:09,440
the sun it's the big

758
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:12,400
skylight and the moon is the big

759
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,599
um light of the night so there's the

760
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,240
light of the day and the light of the

761
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,960
night

762
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,160
but then someone wants to know what the

763
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,160
stars look like

764
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:22,078
and you know the ancestors came from the

765
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:25,359
stars and there must be

766
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:29,839
lights up there and he wants to see that

767
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:29,839
with his own eyes

768
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:53,598
and yeah it's many thousand pages

769
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:57,280
and well it feels like many thousand

770
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:57,599
pages but always get the reaction yeah

771
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,160
it's

772
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:02,720
way too short so it apparently reads

773
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,720
quite quickly

774
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,680
a lot more questions yeah good fish

775
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:15,440
how do you handle writing your books

776
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:16,960
are you first creating id collecting

777
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,599
ideas are you first creating the

778
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,720
characters

779
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:21,119
are you writing short version or are you

780
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:25,118
just

781
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,839
going into it um no i'm not jumping into

782
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:29,839
it i don't know

783
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:39,839
who does that i'm first collecting ideas

784
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:39,839
usually it takes quite a long time

785
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:56,079
and then at some point there are so many

786
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:58,799
ideas on one

787
01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:00,240
in one spot that i have no choice but to

788
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:04,400
make a book out of it

789
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:06,319
and then it's back and forth i think

790
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,760
what could happen and then what

791
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:09,680
character would belong

792
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,039
there or the other way around i start

793
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,558
with the characters and then

794
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:14,880
yeah what's happening what's the

795
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,880
beginning

796
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:21,839
what are the twists that have to happen

797
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:44,960
[Music]

798
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:50,000
i have a feeling how it should be and it

799
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:53,200
works differently but it's still okay

800
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,440
sometimes you have to stop and

801
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,680
plan things a new because it doesn't

802
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:00,000
work the way you wanted to

803
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,520
and it couldn't correct and you always

804
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,079
have to reconsider

805
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:05,038
um did i maybe take a wrong turn

806
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,599
somewhere

807
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:09,119
am i in a dead end and then you have to

808
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:12,240
change something and go back

809
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:15,520
and maybe throw something away

810
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:18,558
but yeah basically it works

811
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:20,319
so i can follow these ideas

812
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:22,160
it's not painting by numbers that

813
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:24,720
wouldn't be fun

814
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,839
and this book you have is that one where

815
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,799
you just collect

816
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:29,599
stories for all the books or is it one

817
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:32,480
book

818
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:34,000
one little notebook for each so is it

819
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,599
something you always have with you when

820
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,960
you're on the road

821
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:41,760
no i always have something to write but

822
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:45,039
if there was first time an official

823
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,039
notebook for ideas

824
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,879
if they had run out of ideas i would

825
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:04,160
have

826
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:06,960
get to 300. or something yeah maybe

827
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,520
then the greek thinkers would be still

828
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,799
alive

829
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:13,119
yeah maybe other french ones

830
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,119
or

831
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,240
do you want to tell us what you are

832
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,240
working on right now

833
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:35,119
young adult that comes out soon

834
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,960
next year i think but

835
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:40,319
i don't have to say anything about it

836
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,319
because i don't really like that

837
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:57,839
that's how it should be so i have to

838
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:01,118
check again

839
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:02,160
right so the question i forgot was

840
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:05,280
repeated

841
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:09,038
sorry hello

842
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,039
hello andreas some of your

843
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:27,440
was having me quite excited

844
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:29,118
well not excited disturbed well that

845
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:32,079
doesn't have to be a negative thing it

846
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:32,079
depends on the story

847
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:37,039
i gotta say when

848
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:51,279
in the moment when you read it you are

849
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:54,960
shocked of course

850
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:57,119
but some decades later you say well

851
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:05,839
that's just how it is that's the logic

852
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:05,839
of the story

853
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,039
also suffers

854
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,720
back then it was a lot of money

855
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:40,720
and he's inheriting not only the money

856
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:47,839
but also the prophecy that he will

857
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:47,839
save humanity's fate with that money

858
01:06:56,079 --> 01:07:01,839
it's not only nice if you inherit a

859
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:01,839
billion

860
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:13,119
is always written by different authors

861
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:15,359

873
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:49,598
curious what i talked myself into there

874
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:50,799
um yeah i'm just scrolling up a little

875
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:54,079
if i missed something

876
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:57,839
else and indeed there is something um

877
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:57,839
they are asking

878
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,839
uh the english title is the three-party

879
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:15,680
competition for them

880
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:18,238
it is a rather big

881
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,960
village and i read a lot of books that

882
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:22,238
you should have

883
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:26,000
read not yet i know they are of theirs

884
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:26,799
and i'm someone who is often a few years

885
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,120
behind

886
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:30,080
in reading something that other people

887
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:34,080
forgot by then

888
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:34,080
so i'm not reading current titles

889
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:40,479
from author then

890
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:42,000
sometimes there is something new that i

891
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:44,559
really have to read but that's

892
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,560
an exception

893
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,600
that's nice to hear because my to read

894
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:55,679
list is growing and growing subscribe

895
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:58,400
do you have maybe questions for the

896
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:00,799
listeners or watchers

897
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:02,000
no i'm in the answer mode i don't have

898
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:05,198
questions

899
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,640
this is a comment from the translator i

900
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:09,919
also have a

901
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,920
ever-growing to read books

902
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:17,359
yeah so another thing great thank you

903
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:21,600
my kids also love your books and are

904
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:25,040
always asking for a new one

905
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,799
i really like it when kids are reading

906
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,880
and i like it when men are reading as

907
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:35,839
well

908
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:35,839
because that is

909
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,679
whenever someone says i'm not reading

910
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:09,920
anything that's

911
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:12,800
thought of oh that's just

912
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,800
just wasting time i i'm shattering and

913
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:17,120
that's just not true

914
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,120
because

915
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,520
the good ones they can tell you things

916
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:31,280
that non-fiction

917
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:31,280
books cannot tell

918
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,770
[Music]

919
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:42,139
[Applause]

920
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:47,120
i really really really need to ask i'm

921
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:49,759
not just

922
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:50,640
a listener and sometimes buyer but also

923
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:55,280
the books

924
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:55,280
especially nsa there is a message

925
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,960
so with this fiction fictitious stories

926
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:02,320
with

927
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:06,239
so much so much in there

928
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:08,880
you can give that to people to also

929
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,519
provide a topic to them because if you

930
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,040
are

931
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,040
just on the short term

932
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:27,599
and also maybe not the copyright

933
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:29,120
working so not a proper copyright proper

934
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,960
way of gifting books

935
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:33,120
isn't that all so nice for you as an

936
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:36,400
author if i give away books

937
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:38,880
to someone when i think

938
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:39,679
you need this book i give it to you what

939
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,280
do you think

940
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:42,800
is it more important to gain a new

941
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:45,599
reader or to keep

942
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,600
the copyright

943
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:50,000
i'm a bit split about that

944
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:55,839
because on the one hand i'm living

945
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:08,960
can

946
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,440
and that's more important than any other

947
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:18,239
price and that's

948
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:19,919
surprised that you win or the award that

949
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:23,040
you win by your readers

950
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:25,040
by every single one who is getting the

951
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:27,120
book

952
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,880
and whenever you get a book in your

953
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,960
house you pick up a book

954
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,920
and you say ah i know that author i'll

955
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:36,480
buy that

956
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:39,760
that's the money purse price or award

957
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:41,440
and that's paying for the bookshops

958
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,800
and the publishers and of course the

959
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:46,320
author as well

960
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:49,120
so if you don't get that

961
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:50,159
so even if they read a book of mine and

962
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:53,120
they don't recognize

963
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:53,120
me that's bad for me

964
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,600
so that's that aspect the author has to

965
01:12:56,159 --> 01:13:01,839
live from something

966
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,840
and by having fans

967
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:07,440
waiting for the next book and uh

968
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:10,239
collecting money for him to be able to

969
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:12,559
buy to write the book and of course yeah

970
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:15,839
there were libraries

971
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:18,320
since forever basically

972
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,400
everyone who is an author used the

973
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:22,960
libraries in his youth

974
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:24,480
and i was reading everything i could get

975
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,440
my hands on

976
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,799
and i could not have been i could not

977
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:32,159
have paid for all that

978
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:33,120
um my parents also didn't really buy

979
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:36,320
books

980
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:39,360
that was not a thing a few

981
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:42,080
were there that came from somewhere

982
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,960
but buying a book that was something i

983
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:47,840
invented

984
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:47,840
that entering a bookstore

985
01:13:49,840 --> 01:14:01,840
when you could get a small

986
01:13:52,960 --> 01:14:01,840
book for two mark 80.

987
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,320
don't know that an author also gets

988
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:14,400
money if

989
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:14,400
a book gets checked out in a library

990
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:33,440
yeah of course i'm not against libraries

991
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:37,360
the darknet is not paying me anything

992
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:40,000
for downloads downloads um

993
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:42,159
whatever they are getting the keyboard

994
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,159
well

995
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:54,239
books for blind people i'm not getting

996
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:54,239
anything but that's a different story

997
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:58,960
so fair use rules are a different story

998
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,480
maybe also not an important topic

999
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:08,799
anymore now that

1000
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:12,799
audio books are important but i remember

1001
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:16,400
books for blind people it's very thick

1002
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:19,440
with rice um yeah another

1003
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:22,799
fascinating question in format were you

1004
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:25,839
always close to ccc because of your

1005
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:28,719
computer science background

1006
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,840
i wanted a new thing because of research

1007
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:33,440
oh i don't really

1008
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:36,159
know when i first heard of ccc but it's

1009
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:38,639
been a long time it was something where

1010
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:42,799
you already were interested in computers

1011
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:45,040
and back then you had to know

1012
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,880
that the ccc existed which is also due

1013
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:49,440
to the cleverly chosen name

1014
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:51,040
i mean ks computer club everyone can

1015
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:55,360
imagine something

1016
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:55,360
everyone who is into computers

1017
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,679
every now and then i was checking the

1018
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:04,320
website but i wasn't

1019
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:04,320
too connected

1020
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:11,280
and i was checking it out in research

1021
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:12,718
when it was about voting machines and

1022
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,519
why you shouldn't use them i mean

1023
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:16,400
americans

1024
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:21,840
are seeing right now why you shouldn't

1025
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:21,839
but they don't get it

1026
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,719
machine into a chest computer in 60

1027
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:39,920
seconds

1028
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:42,159
stuff like that i learned a lot from

1029
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:46,480
that

1030
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:49,199
yeah that's nice to hear yeah i also

1031
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,159
well i have to think books i think

1032
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:53,199
there's

1033
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:56,239
some darts archived

1034
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:59,360
is our ccc magazine this

1035
01:16:56,239 --> 01:17:03,110
is some very good reading material for

1036
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:06,148
rainy days

1037
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:06,148
[Music]

1038
01:17:10,770 --> 01:17:13,909
[Music]

1039
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,840
a reference

1040
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,519
do you think um the effects could have

1041
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:36,400
been stopped

1042
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,400
in your story

1043
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:42,719
yeah i didn't think about that when

1044
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,239
writing the stories because um it would

1045
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:46,400
have been

1046
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:47,919
had it would have had to be established

1047
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:51,360
first i think

1048
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:54,560
dictatorships after they've been

1049
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:57,679
established successfully they can only

1050
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,320
be taken down from the inside hitler

1051
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:02,159
would have

1052
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:05,199
died and maybe his follower

1053
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:06,159
wouldn't have been that good we can see

1054
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:09,040
that in other

1055
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:13,759
right-wing parties those aren't the

1056
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:13,760
sharpest tools in the shed

1057
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:28,320
it's always been like that and then

1058
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,320
maybe 50 years later

1059
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:36,159
a situation with arisen where

1060
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:40,320
the team spirit would have been down

1061
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:43,679
and yeah because dictatorship

1062
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:47,120
also isn't the very best

1063
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:49,120
form of government

1064
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:51,840
yeah and then the situation would have

1065
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,840
arisen where

1066
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:54,880
well

1067
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:03,040
the computer dictatorship and how it

1068
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:06,840
could have been stopped and

1069
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:09,840
of course insiders would have had a key

1070
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,840
role

1071
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:17,760
the power against the leaders

1072
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:20,800
of the party yeah that would be a whole

1073
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:21,679
other novel but i don't think that i'm

1074
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,400
going to

1075
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:27,120
write that this was would take us back

1076
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:30,480
to the snowden reference right

1077
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:33,920
it's good well

1078
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:36,080
my novel doesn't um provide an

1079
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:38,560
alternative universe there are

1080
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:40,719
novels that do but mine isn't one of

1081
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,719
them

1082
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:46,239
this isn't a parallel universe

1083
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:53,519
this is such a cycle it's just a call

1084
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,520
for attention

1085
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:05,840
so it isn't a parallel universe i would

1086
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:05,839
be interested in following up with

1087
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:23,679
the research

1088
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:23,678
about how they treated people that is

1089
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,560
that's not something i would be very

1090
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:33,840
pleased to

1091
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:33,840
go into but

1092
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:49,120
just a follow-up question

1093
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,880
what do you think of the future of data

1094
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:53,040
protection well

1095
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:55,040
citizens become more and more

1096
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:58,320
transparent

1097
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,320
and what is your position

1098
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:05,600
well transparent citizens

1099
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:08,960
yeah i do believe that this is the case

1100
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:10,159
because apparently which is collecting

1101
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:15,840
and collecting data

1102
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:15,839
and not finding anything

1103
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:32,400
that feels protected by being watched

1104
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:33,280
because they know that um if i lose my

1105
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:36,080
phone

1106
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,080
i'd be lost

1107
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:45,679
and no one well look after me

1108
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:48,159
so that is the mindset

1109
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:49,199
that is being created by that those

1110
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:53,519
technologies

1111
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:57,839
of course so i don't yeah i think that

1112
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:57,840
will go in that direction and for myself

1113
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:02,480
i protect myself best as i can

1114
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,719
um

1115
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:15,759
people who only send encrypted emails

1116
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:16,239
are becoming suspicious on their own

1117
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:19,600
because

1118
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:23,440
uh that creates an interest

1119
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:24,880
why would they do that let's look into

1120
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:28,960
that

1121
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:32,000
from thinking from the state side

1122
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:35,760
talking corporations

1123
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:38,480
it also has the aspect

1124
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:39,440
well that we don't know how what

1125
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:42,320
percentage is

1126
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,960
company and what percentage goes to

1127
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:46,559
other

1128
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:49,440
agencies like our famous nsa

1129
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:53,360
and i think you can safely assume that

1130
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:57,519
the data goes to the nsa

1131
01:22:53,360 --> 01:23:07,839
so how can you protect yourself

1132
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:07,840
sorry bad audio

1133
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:20,960
and i say i don't have such a thing

1134
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,960
if i go out i'm offline if i go to the

1135
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:35,840
and if you need to register i don't use

1136
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:35,839
it

1137
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,080
you can only register for some doctors

1138
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:46,639
with a nap

1139
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:47,519
and otherwise you don't get an

1140
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:51,280
appointment

1141
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:51,280
that would be my personal nightmare

1142
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,159
yeah i used to have a cell phone way

1143
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:59,040
back

1144
01:23:56,159 --> 01:24:03,839
when that was um like in the 90s when

1145
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:03,840
that was still a brick

1146
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:21,040
you used it on the tram but

1147
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:22,480
i gave it away in 96 and i was glad to

1148
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:27,280
do so

1149
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:27,280
i was glad to be rid of it stupid thing

1150
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:34,480
i hate the phone so why should i have

1151
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,120
a phone on my person all the time that's

1152
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:38,400
great

1153
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:40,559
and i completely understand you i so get

1154
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,559
you

1155
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,840
um

1156
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:02,480
also you have that in the um swabian

1157
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:05,040
embassies library in stuttgart

1158
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:07,440
interesting and they're also working on

1159
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:13,840
an archive

1160
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:13,839
so do you watch tv

1161
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:24,159
do you watch some um series uh some

1162
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:27,840
shows on dvd like gamer phones

1163
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:27,839
breaking bad

1164
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:34,718
well i do follow it with an interest

1165
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:41,840
like reports about serious

1166
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:41,840
uh about tv shows because the syrians

1167
01:25:45,650 --> 01:25:48,790
[Music]

1168
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,120
you can't really make a movie out of a

1169
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:56,959
novel for

1170
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:56,960
dramaturgic reasons

1171
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:04,080
because of all the complex plot

1172
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:06,480
strings in a novel that's hard to put in

1173
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,480
a movie

1174
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,719
and

1175
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:19,120
movies based on books are basically

1176
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,120
short stories

1177
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:26,639
but i haven't had a tv in like

1178
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:30,000
almost 30 years well

1179
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:37,840
yeah um you have a good reason for that

1180
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:37,840
yeah i can live with that

1181
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:54,239
almost automatically reaches for the

1182
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,239
remote

1183
01:26:57,540 --> 01:27:04,639
[Laughter]

1184
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:07,120
i'm talking about tv shows

1185
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:08,560
do you have a lot of time to build your

1186
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:12,320
characters and that

1187
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:12,320
also makes them so fascinating

1188
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,199
okay okay

1189
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:27,600
just one question i'm seeing right now

1190
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:31,360
what am i more afraid of companies

1191
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:36,480
or the state surveillance of course

1192
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:36,480
the state surveillance amazon google

1193
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:43,280
they won't um send me someone

1194
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,840
who will kick in my door early in the

1195
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:47,360
morning

1196
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:48,320
and drag me into a car and i've never

1197
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,960
heard of again but

1198
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:52,239
i understand states countries they do

1199
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:56,000
that all the time

1200
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:59,120
every night all over the world

1201
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:03,840
people just disappear never reappear

1202
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:07,199
so states states are the real criminals

1203
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:11,040
the worst criminals they

1204
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:13,839
killed more than two million people

1205
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:16,159
in uh the ninth in the 20th century

1206
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:19,679
alone put them in gulags and

1207
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:19,679
concentration camps

1208
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:28,400
sometimes sometimes they're incompetent

1209
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:45,360
buy shares of companies to use them for

1210
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,239
their

1211
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:51,040
own purposes because we've seen that in

1212
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:51,040
recent times

1213
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:57,840
nothing can protect even that's

1214
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:06,239
because um you used to say well um the

1215
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:06,960
government doesn't understand the

1216
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:08,638
internet or

1217
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:11,840
doesn't know how to use the media but

1218
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:11,840
you can't count on that

1219
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,920
it's hard to know what's going on

1220
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:25,679
[Music]

1221
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:28,320
of yours would be the best suited for a

1222
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:28,320
tv show

1223
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:39,840
so i now have to pay close attention to

1224
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:39,839
what i'm saying but um

1225
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:53,840
one of your books made into a movie

1226
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:23,310
[Applause]

1227
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:34,400
the federal system is helping yeah

1228
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:37,678
it can have advantages so

1229
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:39,440
further hints to the three body problems

1230
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:41,600
yes yes i'm reading them i'm reading

1231
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,599
them

1232
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:48,560
also read the free access it's a nice

1233
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:50,800
thing i have to read it but it takes

1234
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,800
time

1235
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:55,280
yeah well it's still on my turret tower

1236

1239
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,920
least

1240
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,239

1242
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:20,480
big big thank you again

1243
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:23,040
for the reading of this very

1244
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:23,759
difficult scene this very troubling

1245
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:25,920
scene

1246
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,920
uh

1247
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:33,120
well illustrating scene that illustrates

1248
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:33,120
well what the problem is

1249
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:36,800
why are you buying books

1250
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:41,600
and german books is difficult yeah this

1251
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:45,840
is really

1252
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,840
yeah france and books in general

1253
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:52,400
they are terribly expensive here as well

1254
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:54,480
we can't

1255
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:58,239
imagine in germany how expensive hooks

1256
01:31:54,480 --> 01:32:02,159
can be um

1257
01:31:58,239 --> 01:32:03,839
yeah i am ordering at mr bezos

1258
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:05,839
well but the other way around it's also

1259
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:08,800
difficult to find french books in

1260
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,800
germany that's awesome

1261
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:13,840
with amazon accounts

1262
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:23,120
and disadvantages you have to say and as

1263
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:26,320
an author

1264
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:29,120
to avoid amazon it's basically it's

1265
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:31,120
difficult to impossible because it is a

1266
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:34,639
huge market

1267
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:37,760
yes yeah

1268
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:40,960
yeah honestly what would we do

1269
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:45,199
if mr buses would say tomorrow

1270
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:48,400
yeah let's close down the shop

1271
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:52,000
yeah but actually also now

1272
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:56,159
with the beginning of corona

1273
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,159
2020 that's more bookshops

1274
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:00,800
they could also get things done they

1275
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:03,840
were starting

1276
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:06,400
and maybe it would also help us

1277
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:08,080
as well to get things going so there is

1278
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:12,000
still hope

1279
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:15,280
so there's a lot of things in chat

1280
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:20,840

1287
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:52,960
between the years it's difficult to find

1288
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:52,960
time

1289
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:56,560

is

1294
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:11,280
the holidays are not the perfect timing

1295
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,280
for me

1296
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:18,239
because right before new year's

1297
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:24,880
i'm usually right at the end of writing

1298
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:28,320
a book that i have to hand in in january

1299
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:28,320
and i'm always late of course

1300
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:33,679
but your editor is waiting for it and in

1301
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:35,650
the end it's too short again right

1302
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:38,880
yeah probably yeah

1303
01:34:35,650 --> 01:34:43,519
[Laughter]

1304
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:46,000
great so thank you very very much

1305
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:46,719
the other angels or harolds do you want

1306
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,760
to

1307
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:49,760
say something as well

1308
01:34:52,480 --> 01:35:01,839
nobody wants all these internet

1309
01:34:56,639 --> 01:35:01,840
janky the world's

1310
01:35:13,119 --> 01:35:18,159
about half an hour longer now and they

1311
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:23,119
were given permission for an hour longer

1312
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:23,119
so there's always space in the internet

1313
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:26,000
thank you again

1314
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:32,400
