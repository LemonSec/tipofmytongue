1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:10,520
[Music]

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,520
[Applause]

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,560
operating system

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,320
which is a debian based derivative

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,279
bringing open source technology for

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,840
sailors

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,880
and we also built a lot of software for

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,160
that

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,519
to do that we started building a

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,240
framework called isomer which delivers

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,519
basic

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,640
stuff for that we'll come to that later

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,600
so the history is pretty

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,360
old already like 10 years almost we were

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,399
founded shortly before the camp back

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,320
then

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,480
and since then we've been organizing

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,320
hackathons there was one big one for the

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,879
euro python for example

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,199
or some maneuvers in the baltic sea

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,280
where we tested our prototypes

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,480
and developed maritime concepts and

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,399
technology

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,919
open source is always a must i've

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,160
already mentioned it

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,320
and it's kind of like what what sailors

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,960
do sailors love open data

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,679
they all have lots of reference manuals

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,720
and data

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,159
on on atmospheric conditions for example

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:17,679
and it's it's open source because

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,920
otherwise it would be difficult there's

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,720
some problems with proprietary stuff in

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,280
this market

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,960
because for example c charts are often

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,880
commercially only available

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,240
and we're trying to change that by

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,520
developing something

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,158
to actually make the opencma better

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,439
that's one of our purposes sailing is

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,920
one of the the most

42
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,600
driving things so we try to optimize

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,759
things here

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,798
then there's the isomeric community

45
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,079
which is a

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,640
small github organization which is

47
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,839
aimed at was was founded to promote the

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,600
development of the

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,640
the application framework which we're

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,759
using which i'll detail later

51
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,680
so um i i hope if you

52
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,520
join the organization and maybe see my

53
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,759
other lectures which are revolving

54
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:08,399
around isomer again

55
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,759
um so what are those things actually

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,920
i'd like to start with a heck of freed

57
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,640
operating system because it demonstrates

58
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,000
what isomer actually is capable of

59
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,359
and for that i've made a few slides to

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,520
describe

61
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,599
hafez yeah it's it's a german

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,800
pronunciation uh unless somebody comes

63
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,599
up with a better name

64
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,920
we had lots of acronyms uh this one just

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,238
stuck too long

66
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,679
okay to give you an overview it's uh as

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,440
i already mentioned the debian based

68
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,560
operating system with pre-installed

69
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,359
modules

70
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,280
and iso messages and an isomer system

71
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,440
which offers a user interface

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,120
and it's optimized for low cost low

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,879
budget low power

74
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,200
what sailors need it's kind of

75
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,440
ruggedized we we often

76
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,119
build raspberry pi units that you can

77
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,200
easily mount in your ship

78
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,160
it's comparable to something like

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,599
opencpn

80
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,159
or signal k or various other programs

81
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,399
and you can combine them actually

82
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,319
so core functionality is c charts and

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,640
navigational aspects

84
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,879
but we also do data logging and analysis

85
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,040
crew information management systems

86
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,640
and we'd like to integrate external data

87
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,879
sources as i already mentioned it's all

88
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,799
about open data after all

89
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,040
it also includes a few utilities for

90
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,680
ships like an anchor manager anchor

91
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,319
watch

92
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,200
or crew registration systems information

93
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,839
systems

94
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,040
you can document your travels or

95
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,440
organize your

96
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,480
imagery your pictures you took while

97
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,560
sailing

98
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,760
and lots more let's have some

99
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,159
screenshots to

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,040
to see what actually is uh in there

101
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,159
right now

102
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,319
this is the the boot menu there we have

103
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,959
some basic functionality it's just open

104
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,480
street map with a small dashboard

105
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,080
but here you can see a little more

106
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,359
complex example this is

107
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,360
a prototype screenshot of the ais system

108
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,799
which we integrated where you can see

109
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,720
other vessels around you

110
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,799
and see your own position on a satellite

111
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,519
hybrid map because this is actually not

112
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,799
only satellite it's also

113
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,080
open street map overlaid with it

114
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,920
here we have a real dashboard

115
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,519
application where you can actually see

116
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,320
the the course that was

117
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,720
sailed and some performance parameters

118
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,959
up here

119
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,199
here's another screenshot which demos of

120
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,280
the dashboard and ais functionality as

121
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,040
you can see there's these red lines

122
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,320
and those are five minute markers of

123
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,960
those vessels

124
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,560
uh where they will be if they continue

125
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,080
sailing for five minutes as you can see

126
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,440
some of them would crash into land so

127
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,000
they're probably going to change the

128
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,639
course

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
you can observe all this in in the ais

130
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,880
view

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,639
we also came up with the the idea of

132
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,680
combining freifonk with maritime

133
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,919
technologies

134
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,520
like every sailor should have a fifth

135
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,280
installation on his boat

136
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,198
so you can share your wi-fi with other

137
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,799
people and for that purpose we build a

138
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,800
radio range display

139
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,919
which shows you where other sailors with

140
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,080
network access

141
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,960
might be in your region so you might

142
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,880
actually grab

143
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,000
some internet coverage where your own

144
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,639
antenna won't

145
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,039
really be able to help you but you can

146
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,880
use

147
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:15,120
other people's mesh network nodes

148
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,840
we also integrated some small tools for

149
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,120
classical sailing materials like raster

150
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,880
charts

151
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,160
vector charts are really problematic

152
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,479
right now because they are

153
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,400
encrypted and it's a very proprietary

154
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,000
format but we're trying to change that

155
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,638
as well in the long run

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,320
especially by integrating open data

157
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,080
sources like opencm

158
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,479
opencmap and other available data

159
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,520
so for that purpose you can combine

160
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,479
layers and have

161
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,599
very sophisticated setups for various

162
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,240
data sources

163
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,039
that are available online you can also

164
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,840
take these

165
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,960
data layers with you by downloading them

166
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,440
at least

167
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,400
with some it's possible and you can

168
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,960
always

169
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,679
cache tile imagery data but it's not

170
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,919
perfect

171
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,280
so another reason why we want vector

172
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,440
data

173
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,960
this these are some weather maps i don't

174
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,560
know if they are still existing these

175
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,359
screenshots are a little bit older

176
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,840
but you can see that there's lots of

177
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,360
interesting stuff to do

178
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,919
we also have some rather uncommon

179
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,840
visualization i'm not even sure what

180
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,359
this was meant to visualize but i

181
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,880
thought it was a nice screenshot so i

182
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,400
added it

183
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,719
we also have responsive in our mind so

184
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,758
classically you have one board computer

185
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,680
on your ship

186
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,800
and maybe it's in your navigation corner

187
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,960
there's a screen

188
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,880
keyboard mouse and you run some windows

189
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,520
software on that mostly

190
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,840
and we thought let's bring the bring

191
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,680
your own device concept to sailors why

192
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,039
why can't i use my smartphone or my

193
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,039
tablet i mean

194
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,400
almost every sailor's got some of these

195
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,400
sketches on his ship to

196
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,840
these days why not use them for

197
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,479
navigational purposes

198
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,880
for for communication with crew maybe

199
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,440
they are

200
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,360
in the harbor or somewhere it brings a

201
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,759
lot of interesting aspects

202
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,400
combining these these new tools we have

203
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,639
with a

204
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:09,758
rather old trade such as sailing um

205
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,800
this this more like uh we we have a

206
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,120
switchboard which

207
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,960
you can use to turn off and on your 12

208
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,599
volt supplies

209
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,440
um also night view this is an early

210
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,280
prototype you can see still

211
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,280
can still see some white elements which

212
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,479
are not supposed to be there

213
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,280
and that brings me um to the end of the

214
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,400
screenshots

215
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,880
and i hope i'll be able to present some

216
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,120
more

217
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,880
new ones next year because right now i'm

218
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,800
in the background working on a new front

219
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,440
end which has been overhauled

220
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,720
because what you've seen here is mostly

221
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,280
a very old

222
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,960
version of angular and right now we are

223
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,400
modernizing this to be

224
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,520
compatible with most modern systems by

225
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,280
upgrading to ionic

226
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,120
but these were the hackerfleet operating

227
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,039
system screenshots let's head over to

228
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,919
the isomer application framework

229
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,159
which you've been kind of seeing already

230
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,919
it's the common functionality that was

231
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,680
developed in a modular way

232
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,878
to enable operations like sailing

233
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,000
and the data aggregation we do and

234
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,120
the user information services and

235
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,039
at some time in development we notice

236
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,039
that the framework itself is pretty

237
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,280
versatile and

238
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,120
has mustered up to a lot of other tasks

239
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,440
so i started splitting out

240
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,879
the hackerfleet operating system core

241
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,440
functionality

242
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,919
from the framework functionality and

243
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,279
that

244
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,279
way isomer was born

245
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,439
there's a few very interesting features

246
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,440
or technologies in the framework which

247
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,839
you can see in other frameworks as well

248
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,839
but i think the the combination of them

249
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,640
makes it pretty somewhat somewhat pretty

250
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,600
unique we we are focusing on rapid

251
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,399
development

252
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,320
like i don't want to be harassed by a

253
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,240
platform specifics for example that

254
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,920
that's the reason why we use ionic for

255
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,519
the front end because you

256
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,439
build it once and it works everywhere

257
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,800
there's a heavy focus on collaboration

258
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,720
with synchronization i'm investigating

259
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,040
three clocks and interval clocks and

260
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,959
other stuff to get

261
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,719
data synchronized between clients so you

262
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,479
can collaboratively edit any data object

263
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,560
there is no cloud necessary because

264
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,800
while sailing you you usually don't have

265
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,719
access to to cloud infrastructure

266
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:34,479
there's only the wind um data clouds are

267
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,279
far er far away from your

268
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,200
ship usually so this has to run offline

269
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,200
off the grid

270
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,600
um also obviously geodata is very

271
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,200
very important for sailors so these are

272
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,240
first-class citizens

273
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,200
and um along the way i came

274
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,160
up with the proposal to not only treat

275
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,200
geodata as

276
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,880
firstly citizen but any data so

277
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:04,320
it's driven by shimata and it's

278
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,560
constantly validating data and allows to

279
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,160
for example take diffs and patches from

280
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,040
data structures which you then can

281
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,519
seamlessly

282
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,040
integrate with synchronization methods

283
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,079
there's also a lot of

284
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,760
general functionality for your general

285
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,479
website or application

286
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,120
that you necessarily need somehow sooner

287
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,959
or later

288
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,640
like an enrollment system or a

289
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,760
gamification

290
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,760
module or notifications for users

291
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,880
these kind of things and i constantly

292
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,519
see them being

293
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,000
developed new and and new and being

294
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,959
rolled

295
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,040
all the time because people build those

296
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,479
on a daily basis for their own projects

297
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,839
and the idea was to to take all this

298
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,519
functionality that's being redeveloped

299
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,360
unnecessarily and combine it into a

300
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,880
functional and working framework which

301
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,839
is open source

302
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,120
and i think we're on a good way so

303
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,240
what's it built with

304
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,720
it came to my mind that python 3 is

305
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,440
pretty

306
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,079
nifty and in general the scientific

307
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,680
community has taken up python quite well

308
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,760
i don't think i need to explain its

309
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,599
popularity much more

310
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:14,399
for the front end we decided to

311
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,519
use html5 because as i already mentioned

312
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,560
it just works everywhere

313
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,320
the general communication between

314
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,680
front-end and back-end has been

315
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,399
overhauled because rest

316
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,079
is kind of like it's it feels like an

317
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,560
80s technology it hasn't

318
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,439
seen much overall it's probably solid

319
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,040
but if you

320
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,920
are aiming for low if low energy if

321
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,680
very efficient radio communications

322
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,120
alone thinking about the overhead that

323
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,920
rest imposes on your

324
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,120
data communication is kind of like no i

325
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,760
don't want that

326
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,480
so we decided to move on to websocket

327
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,800
and

328
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,639
in the last few years there's this you

329
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,719
may know things like swagger

330
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,399
or other api definition protocols and

331
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,120
recently there's been this new

332
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,399
maneuver which is called async rpi which

333
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,959
is meant to describe

334
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,920
asynchronous apis like you can do over

335
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,599
websocket

336
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,439
and i've started integrating this into

337
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,360
isomer so you get nice

338
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,440
data sheets about your api and auto

339
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,959
generated documentation

340
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,160
and yeah for objects persistence and

341
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,479
management

342
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,480
because that's one of the core aspects

343
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,480
of every backend

344
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,160
back then i chose mongodb because it

345
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,680
allows to store objects

346
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,160
not only tables some some of the

347
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,319
data objects we're handling in the

348
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,199
maritime setting are quite complex

349
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,399
and doing this with sql would be a major

350
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,279
pain in the ass

351
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,200
so we decided to pick mongodb not for

352
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,880
its sharding functionality or all the

353
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,000
stuff people are always complaining

354
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,760
about

355
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,440
because when you're running it on one

356
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,680
raspberry pi you don't need sharding

357
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,959
functionality strictly speaking

358
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,959
so it was a good choice back then um i'm

359
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,000
starting to regret it a little bit

360
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,839
but uh because of you may

361
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,839
have noticed the license changes they

362
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,399
opposed on their community which are

363
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,279
not so nice for open source projects so

364
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,000
i've started

365
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,519
investigating into exchanging the

366
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,720
handler database handler with the

367
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,880
postgres

368
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,800
system because you can do the same

369
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,839
things in postgres these days and

370
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,920
there's no

371
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,000
loss at geographic information

372
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,240
functionality or anything

373
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,079
and also you can use json schema very

374
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,839
nicely with postgres these days json

375
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,680
schema is the core pillar

376
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,279
of our data structures every data

377
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,359
structure needs to be

378
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:38,720
specified as json shima

379
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,399
this helps us validate for one thing

380
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,680
which is the core functionality of json

381
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,839
shimmer but there's also

382
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,079
very nice front-end libraries for

383
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,199
rendering very sophisticated forms

384
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,599
automatically

385
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,399
without the developer even needing to

386
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,120
touch any

387
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:57,279
design specifics i know this is often

388
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,519
not perfect but if you if you think

389
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,800
about django's admins views for example

390
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,199
it's a great tool i also

391
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,240
use the click library which is a very

392
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,880
very

393
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,959
sophisticated and extremely powerful

394
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,240
command line tool interface

395
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:17,518
so we have a

396
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,600
reply interpreter and automatic

397
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,920
command expansion in that shell et

398
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,120
cetera et cetera

399
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,120
um i hope that made you interested in

400
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,440
the isomer project and also in the

401
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,279
hacker fleet project

402
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,480
if you want to try it out i'm always

403
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,320
here to help you

404
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,880
you can find me in on the contact

405
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,240
channels i will be posting afterwards

406
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,920
and i'm i'd be happy if you reported any

407
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,880
installation box or anything you

408
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,240
stumbled upon

409
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,800
or have any critic constructive critic

410
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,920
i would be happy to receive it maybe you

411
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,639
you can

412
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,240
find something in here and realize your

413
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,839
own projects with the framework

414
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,480
i'd be happy to welcome you in the

415
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,920
community

416
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,480
so um then there is this other topic

417
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,439
what is hackerfleet doing on other

418
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,480
fronts

419
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,880
and we've been busy although

420
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,519
we couldn't sail this year not a lot at

421
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,920
least

422
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,760
most of us but we've come up with other

423
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,279
things that might be interesting for the

424
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,639
community as a whole

425
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,519
so let's dive into that um some weeks

426
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,440
ago i came

427
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,360
up with the idea of a virtual sailors

428
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,120
club it's kind of like a

429
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,279
normal analog sailor scrub but it's

430
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,480
virtual um

431
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,320
yeah maybe there's interest there

432
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,480
and we actually have something similar

433
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,480
we started um

434
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,399
when did we start i think it was three

435
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,560
or four four years ago maybe five

436
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,639
we started the maritime hackers meetup

437
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,399
which is a

438
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,959
small roundtable of interested

439
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,680
community members gathering at ccc

440
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,518
events

441
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:58,399
we'll also host one at this virtual rc3

442
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,040
it will happen on tomorrow afternoon

443
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,199
evening

444
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,680
i'm announcing it hopefully on

445
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,359
some more channels by then there's a

446
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,920
github issue on it

447
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,399
on this task on our remote repository

448
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
tracker

449
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,920
but i'm going to send out more

450
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,759
information on that you can also join

451
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,279
the mailing list i will be announcing it

452
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,120
shortly and

453
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,880
this is a low volume mailing list you

454
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,279
might be interested in what we're doing

455
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,480
and sometimes we also organize

456
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,120
hackathons on boats

457
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,680
this is the first address to talk about

458
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,360
it

459
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:34,880
and some members also have

460
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:39,120
ships and we do organize say crews

461
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,120
now and then for trips around the world

462
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,199
another thing that's that i'm excited to

463
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,839
present

464
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,120
or to announce is that we're going to

465
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,560
produce hardware

466
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,160
hardware very soon like you may have

467
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,239
seen previous hardware designs of

468
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,040
shipboxes and mastboxes

469
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,680
and i'm proud to announce that i'm

470
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,719
currently in the process of

471
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,720
procuring a new bill of materials for a

472
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,839
new product which will be available

473
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,559
sometime next year and it's

474
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,678
a board computer with a little bit of

475
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,559
wi-fi and

476
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,760
but you can extend it it's open hardware

477
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,678
most of it at least

478
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,039
there's some some tiny bits which we

479
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,640
can't really

480
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:24,400
have open source but we're working on it

481
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,079
and the community is always working on

482
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,559
it

483
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,120
if you'd like to be informed about these

484
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,440
move

485
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,678
these movements you might might want to

486
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,919
subscribe to the list that is mentioned

487
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,400
on

488
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,760
in this slide i'll be announcing the

489
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,120
start of

490
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,360
this campaign sometime next year

491
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,559
um yeah i have another slide here for

492
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,159
the maritime hackers media there's the

493
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,678
issue i was talking about this will be

494
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,039
the final discussion point or

495
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,400
announcement point

496
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,440
i i just uh didn't find vicky at the rc3

497
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,200
this year it's

498
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,480
maybe it's hidden away i haven't found

499
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,720
time to dig in

500
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,880
but maybe you want to watch this issue

501
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,880
on when the maritime hackers meet up

502
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,600
will be started but

503
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,880
i'll announce it as soon as we have a

504
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,799
final date

505
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,320
i'd love to see you there and discuss

506
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,879
the international murray team topics

507
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,039
with you

508
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,000
this may range from technology over

509
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,559
social aspects

510
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,039
but we're also talking about economic

511
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,200
things

512
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,960
and ecological things like the

513
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,000
overfishing of the oceans

514
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,480

discussions been happening this last

521
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,039

525
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,840

532
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,879
the 2015 camp

533
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,959
and i think it was at that time it was

534
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,480
pretty much revolutionary and i'm going

535
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,760
to try it again

536
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,240
um crowd management please give us your

537
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,600
input on how we are supposed to

538
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,200
proceed um what are your current wishes

539
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,520
maybe you have some

540
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,559
how would you want to see technology

541
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,879
evolve in

542
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,879
in the hacker fleet context

543
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,960
yeah i'm getting funny notice here we

544
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,000
had some

545
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,559
technical issues and i we need more

546
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,600
better hardware definitely is there

547
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,320
anything

548
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,320
from the internet

549
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,559
oops we're looking for the community

550
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,840
community manager

551
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,799
well um i think we're gonna do this uh

552
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,919
asynchronously because

553
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,840
arsene coronas is always better

554
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,520
you can just join the hackerfleet

555
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,559
channel or

556
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:12,240
join the contact methods that

557
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:14,240
we have here and then just

558
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,440
post them virtually and i'll be

559
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,320
answering them

560
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,559
i'll be here all day my next lecture

561
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,559
starts in half an hour i'm

562
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,840
i will be proud to present the obvious

563
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,520
suit which is something

564
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,678
very different than hacker fleet

565
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,639
operating system but it's been built

566
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,520
with isomer

567
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,799
it's a multimedia suit for mixing or

568
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:37,200
managing mixed media sessions

569
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,918
and it was meant to showcase the

570
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,039
performance

571
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:44,400
aspects of isomer the framework itself

572
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,400
and python especially

573
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,600
yeah getting still more funny messages

574
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,399
from them

575
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,320
so um yeah that pretty much concludes it

576
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,720
