00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,000
today

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,240
we will talk about the topic of sex work

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,640
heard about this a lot everyone has an

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,639
opinion

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,039
is it with the sex workers are they in a

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,080
dangerous

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,480
situation how are their

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,479
surroundings

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,480
here is one person who can talk about it

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,840
she will read about it

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,839
as a sex worker and wrote a book about

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
it

15
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,199
yes i would like to read from my book my

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,240
horn manifesto that

17
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,000
was published in 2018 after i

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,839
wrote about it for quite a while that's

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,880
how it goes with books it takes a while

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,240
to write them

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,039
longer than you think i

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,000
am a founding member of the professional

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,240
association

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,479
of erotic and sexual services and in

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,439
2013

26
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,000
we were we founded ourselves as a

27
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,439
response

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,880
to the rising cause for uh

29
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,279
prohibition on sex work or in purchasing

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,158
sex work i'd like to talk about that i

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,640
was their press

32
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,200
spokes spokesperson for the first four

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,880
years

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,240
and did a lot of work until a literary

35
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,000
agent

36
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,320
approached me and asked whether i

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,200
wouldn't want to turn this into a book

38
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,479
and with the promise that it was allowed

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,479
to become a political book

40
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,239
it became quite a personal thing i

41
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,480
interviewed many colleagues

42
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,640
regarding their own stories so that i

43
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:23,839
wouldn't just be talking about me

44
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,839
customers and operators

45
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,959
scientists researchers on sex work

46
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,040
were given the voice so i hope that i

47
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,000
gave quite a rounded picture in

48
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,519
the book i can only read a small extract

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,200
of course

50
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,959
i'll start with personal then with

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,760
political and

52
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,239
i'm only going to read about half of the

53
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,160
time

54
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,280
and then i'll be very interested in your

55
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,560
questions and in

56
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,159
exchange because in my experience that

57
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,040
is what really gets

58
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,000
more done it's more effective so i'll

59
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,200
start with the

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,040
first chapter with the introduction

61
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,518
and i will then talk a little about

62
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,519
myself

63
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,840
something ought to be done i don't have

64
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,480
a fundamental problem with flat rate sex

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,000
clubs

66
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,799
and i have taken part in gangplank

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,800
parties myself

68
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,480
exactly

69
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,360
i'm having tea with distinguished

70
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,000
educated lady in her mid-60s in a

71
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,080
lavishly

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,599
furnished cafe at the ulster lake in

73
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,480
central hamburg

74
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,000
we are doing vocabulary exercises in sex

75
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,480
work technology

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
my counterpart has been campaigning

77
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,599
against human rights violations

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,280
around the world for many years and

79
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,480
received several awards for that

80
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,760
and in that vein she is now demanding

81
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,200
abolish sex work gangbang

82
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,000
is group sex with more men than women

83
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,839
such ogs are organized both privately

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,400
often in swinger clubs

85
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,760
and in brothels or hotel suites by sex

86
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,760
workers for paying customers

87
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,639
here sometimes i wonder

88
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,120
whether it's not little degrading for

89
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,120
the boys

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,320
in the hands waiting for that turn while

91
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,360
i am comfortably lulling it out in a

92
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,680
love swing

93
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,280
lasciviously waving for the next one to

94
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,080
come closer

95
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,919
but the men who visit these events are

96
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,359
excited by the atmosphere

97
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,440
and by watching ahead of the act

98
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,199
this is their foreplay this is the first

99
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,759
beer their time inside me

100
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,560
until orgasm is mostly two to five

101
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,960
minutes

102
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,160
for me this is sometimes pleasurable

103
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,320
only through the

104
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,720
combined experience and fortunately

105
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,719
having pleasure at work is not forbidden

106
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,000
those who cannot bear weight are allowed

107
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,400
to walk up to my left or

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
right and receive some hand relief i can

109
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,440
multitask

110
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,039
should anyone pester me or ask for

111
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,080
anything i don't want or treat me

112
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,639
unkindly

113
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,080
they'll be quickly called by to order by

114
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,520
the other members of their sex

115
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,120
and that must be happens long before

116
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,758
there's a need for me to assert myself

117
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,000
too much

118
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,520
or for the organizers to step in there

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,919
is a certain social control

120
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,520
at these parties after all bad blood

121
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,120
will only destroy the atmosphere for

122
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,198
everyone

123
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,680
when i've had enough having had

124
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,560
intercourse perhaps five to ten times i

125
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,639
take a break

126
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,160
have a shower and a coke and some

127
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,199
conversation

128
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,919
then it's back to the play area this is

129
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,000
a form

130
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:40,080
of flat rates money is paid as a lump

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,759
sum for the time at the event by the

132
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,960
guests to the organizers

133
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,440
and also by the organizers to me

134
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,719
and that's fine by me i would lose track

135
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,039
in the flow of things

136
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,960
and i don't keep an exact account

137
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,120
for someone who doesn't mind having

138
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,280
quick sex with complete strangers

139
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,560
an afternoon like this is a nice way to

140
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,559
earn money

141
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,080
for those who ascribe much more meaning

142
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,840
to sex than to a

143
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,840
back massage

144
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,318
i am not sure whether my conversation

145
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,919
partner in the ulster side cafe wants to

146
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,560
know that much detail and it would be

147
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,840
far from me to violate her boundaries

148
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,919
but she should want to know since

149
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,919
she claims to be working for prostitutes

150
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,199
and those prostitutes allegedly are in

151
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,159
situations

152
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,280
very different from mine either sold by

153
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,479
human traffickers

154
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,159
or made available for paid abuse or they

155
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,479
are letting themselves be raped every

156
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,000
day

157
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,159
due to being pressurized for their

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,240
families or to avoid starving

159
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,240
i am the single exception and the whole

160
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,000
debate is not about me

161
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,759
let the few german who are in

162
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,400
control of their own lives do whatever

163
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,000
they want

164
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,239
but all these poor young girls from

165
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,039
eastern europe how can you trivialize

166
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,160
that

167
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,318
surely something must be done yes

168
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,319
something must be done whenever i

169
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,240
encounter a colleague who feels trapped

170
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:12,479
in her situation who cannot say no

171
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,479
neither to her family nor to encroaching

172
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,039
customers that want to get the most

173
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,039
out of their

174
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,440
i tell her about alternative options and

175
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,680
sex work

176
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,719
about other places of work where the

177
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,840
customers are more

178
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,360
amenable techniques for distancing

179
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,599
and conducting conversations

180
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,240
professionalizing specializing

181
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,840
and building a regular customer base and

182
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,160
sometimes i do find

183
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,000
that a woman is not suited for a job

184
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,080
where she is directly exposed to

185
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,639
urgent emotions and needs of their

186
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,000
clients of any gender

187
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,160
if they worked as a geriatric carer

188
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,560
a nurse or in a call center for customer

189
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,639
complaints it would break them too

190
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,879
and those who regard sex as something

191
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,919
sacred that can only be had within a

192
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,319
stable relationship

193
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,599
or for making children would clearly not

194
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,520
be happy doing sex work

195
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,919
i wish that these people can find

196
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,758
alternative occupations

197
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,919
and i give contacts to qualified

198
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,120
counselling services that can work out

199
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,000
individual transition plans but there is

200
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,560
one thing i would

201
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
surely not want to do forbid them from

202
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,719
doing sex work

203
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,240
if i try to save anyone by force stop

204
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,159
seeing them as an individual

205
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,080
as an individual with agency and try to

206
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,080
protect them from their own decisions

207
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,519
i would be no better than all those that

208
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,000
pressurize them

209
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,800
no active colleague male or female

210
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,920
however bad their situation was

211
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,399
has ever said to me please criminalize

212
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,479
me

213
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,560
criminalize my customers and let's have

214
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,000
a few more police raids because surely

215
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,000
it will then soon feel better

216
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,160
criminalization and prohibition to work

217
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,760
whether they are dressed up as

218
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,319
protection or otherwise

219
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,120
are not just an inconvenience they lead

220
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,920
to tough fines or prison times

221
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,120
the small number of sex workers that do

222
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,599
call for stricter and more

223
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,279
discriminating regulation of the trade

224
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,120
are mostly figuring that their

225
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:23,839
competition will be hit harder

226
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,839
than they themselves

227
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,760
regarding the debate inside the industry

228
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,080
outside the industry sorry

229
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,680
where calls for containment or abolition

230
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,360
of sex work have been voiced for

231
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,279
i years that a sizable number of

232
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,160
agitators are trying to impose their

233
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,959
personal

234
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,760
moral or ideological sensitivities under

235
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,920
a guise of

236
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,480
concern while it was openly said

237
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,399
throughout much of the 20th century that

238
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,160
society had to be protected

239
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,000
from our deviant and scary immorality

240
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,959
there has fortunately been a change at

241
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,959
least in this country

242
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,120
even for minorities it is now accepted

243
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,079
that the personal freedom can only be

244
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,000
curtailed

245
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:12,399
where someone else is notably impaired

246
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,800
criminal law in criminal law in germany

247
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,000
is no longer used openly

248
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,560
to regulate moral standards this is why

249
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,920
the arguments of prostitution opponents

250
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:27,359
have become more subtle we are no longer

251
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,640
dangerously insane only naive and

252
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,279
manipulated and instead of society it is

253
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,160
now us

254
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,920
that have to be protected but the

255
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,160
favorite ways of protection

256
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,920
are much the same as before special

257
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,880
treatment in criminal law

258
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,360
comprehensive police checks confinement

259
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,320
to state-controlled brothels

260
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,480
and most of all the population should be

261
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,360
prevented from being confronted with our

262
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,360
existence

263
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,360
through non-prosecution zones and

264
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,079
prohibitions on street walking and

265
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,079
advertising

266
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,240
i know from many conversations that many

267
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,440
people really do

268
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,959
mean well with us people who are

269
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,760
confronted with pictures of

270
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,599
young girls in distress and believe it

271
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,160
when someone tells them that this

272
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,040
and only this is what a sex worker looks

273
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,680
like

274
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,800
they believe that coercion violence and

275
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,439
adversity

276
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,160
are part of the system of prostitution

277
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,480
and that

278
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,839
selling bodies as they call it is

279
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,839
inextricably linked with an injured soul

280
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,279
these people are completely taken by

281
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,760
surprise when real

282
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,399
living are out protesting in

283
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,200
front of

284
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,000
rescue industry events with flyers and

285
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,839
banners

286
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,240
rejecting a patronization that is

287
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,800
celebrated as a cure inside

288
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,760
but we only want to help you hang on you

289
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,760
don't even want that

290
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,079
if someone wants to take the well-being

291
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,319
of sex workers to their heart

292
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,560
they must go beyond blind something must

293
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,200
be done activism they must

294
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,319
look and listen and they must include

295
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,800
people like me

296
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,600
the alleged rare privileged exceptional

297
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,519
cases

298
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,360
who carry out their jobs professionally

299
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,519
and with mutual respect between them

300
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,760
and their customers sometimes for many

301
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,079
years

302
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,120
those who etiquently negate our

303
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,519
perspective

304
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,560
and the diversity of our experience as

305
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,079
irrelevant

306
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,839
are missing the opportunity to

307
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,079
understand how the challenges of the

308
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,399
industry could actually be solved we

309
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,399
disprove the convenient assumption that

310
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,120
exchanging sex for money as such

311
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,760
were the problem only then can the

312
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,680
collective

313
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,360
indication about the fate of those

314
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,760
affected by violence and poverty

315
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,600
which truly does exist be turned into

316
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,200
strategies to really improve the living

317
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,240
and working conditions of all sex

318
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,720
workers

319
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,360
that would make so much more sense than

320
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:53,279
furthering

321
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:55,519
social discrimination and stigma

322
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,279
and now something about my personal

323
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,320
story from the story from the

324
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,800
chapters called the story of you so you

325
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,200
work as a dominatrix

326
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,240
most people picture dominatrix as a

327
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,560
woman who takes a whip to her customers

328
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,639
who loudly reviles them while staying

329
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,638
dressed in patent and leather

330
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,040
and mostly buttoned up to the neck

331
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,959
sometimes that is indeed what i do

332
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,079
sometimes i am the one who is getting a

333
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,319
good beating

334
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,760
sometimes i have wild and filthy sex

335
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,680
with my paying guests

336
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,959
maybe as part of role play in a sexy

337
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,000
secretary outfit

338
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,399
or wearing nothing but high boots

339
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
in some of my paid encounters all of

340
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,079
this can happen

341
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,320
sometimes i let myself get banged in

342
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,239
swinger clubs or porn cinemas

343
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,120
or i assist a man in his first

344
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,920
experience with another man

345
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,199
some of my customers only know my voice

346
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,240
as i lead them into

347
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:52,560
erotic hypnosis by a phone skype or

348
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,199
audio file

349
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,040
my sex work career started in a peep

350
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,519
show

351
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,360
i have experience in various brothels

352
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,560
and sm studios

353
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,920
in apartments as an erotic misses

354
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,800
in sex parties as a phone and webcam sex

355
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,839
performer

356
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,680
and as an escort in recent years i have

357
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,519
mostly worked in bdsm

358
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,079
fetish and role play my current target

359
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,560
group

360
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,680
therefore are mostly people who in a

361
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,399
wide sense have

362
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,079
sexual interests outside the gnome the

363
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,120
job title that my customers have

364
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,719
established to me

365
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,120
is bizarre lady but this word is hardly

366
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,839
known to anyone outside the paid sm sex

367
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,399
scene

368
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,240
that is why i tend to reply yeah yeah to

369
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,839
the question about the dominatrix

370
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,279
when i am not in the mood for lengthy

371
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,040
explanations but

372
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,120
this is actually just a description of a

373
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,719
small part of my work

374
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,800
i always find it strange if people

375
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,639
assume that i am privileged because

376
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,000
sexual intercourse is not always the

377
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,320
focus of my work so

378
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,440
that i do not have to spread my legs for

379
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,680
every customer

380
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,279
at the same time these people pity those

381
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,279
poor other prostitutes

382
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,199
who of course are so often confronted

383
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,560
with the depraved desires of their

384
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,959
perverted punters

385
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,599
what is it then are special requests a

386
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,199
privilege

387
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,399
or an imposition the significance of the

388
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,279
answer to this question

389
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,120
cannot be overestimated the answer is it

390
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,320
depends

391
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,560
on the personal comfort zones

392
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,600
and individual boundaries of the person

393
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,479
providing the services

394
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,680
from the outside nobody can know or even

395
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,759
rule

396
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,120
which practices with which customers are

397
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,079
okay or not

398
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,480
for an individual provider there are no

399
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,959
generally valid standards or rules

400
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,399
what sex workers should or would do or

401
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,800
not do

402
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,519
some kiss their customers some actually

403
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,800
enjoy doing this

404
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:53,519
for others this is unimaginable some

405
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,279
find anal sex totally relaxing but are

406
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,360
not interested in roleplay

407
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,519
and some do not like their feet being

408
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,600
licked because they are ticklish

409
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,160
i for one do not enjoy entertaining

410
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,000
drunken tourists in amusement areas

411
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,040
but for others this target group is a

412
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,759
welcome source for easy money

413
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,480
one of my dominating colleagues

414
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,639
considers it

415
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,079
highly amusing to torment their male

416
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,880
playmates until they break down

417
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,560
completely

418
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,880
but whoa if they should want to wear

419
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,359
ladies learn to read in the process

420
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,680
because if the customers have to take on

421
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,680
a female role in order to be humiliated

422
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,839
their image of women is unacceptable to

423
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,839
this female colleague

424
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,079
in a general sense customer switches are

425
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,720
to be regarded as neutral and cannot be

426
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,560
judged

427
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,000
if an adult and mature person can be

428
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,079
found who can sense to put these

429
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,240
fantasies into reality for a fee

430
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,000
great when some service providers

431
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,560
sometimes more often

432
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,399
overstep their own boundaries and go

433
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,199
along with things that are not good for

434
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,519
them

435
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,319
due to external most economic

436
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,360
constraints

437
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,759
or interior convictions or beliefs

438
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,560
this is neither desirable nor a part of

439
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:04,720
the sex work system

440
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,720
and that is not limited to our industry

441
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,240
of course there is much more in the book

442
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,360
and

443
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,760
i am open to questions of all kinds

444
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,879
after the reading personal private

445
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,079
questions

446
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,319
about my everyday work experience

447
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,119
but i would like to go on to the

448
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,720
political

449
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,719
situation and mostly

450
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,000
prostitution protection act which came

451
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,960
to force in 2016-17

452
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,960
which was installed to regulate sex work

453
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,640
there is a large difference

454
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,559
between decriminalization and

455
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,640
legalization

456
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,799
the sex work movement worldwide is

457
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,240
calling for a decriminalization

458
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,879
that is an abolishment of special laws

459
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,760
and an introduction of sex work into the

460
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,799
normal legal system what we get instead

461
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,919
partly and in germany since 2017

462
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:07,600
is the legalization in the sense of

463
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:10,799
further paragraph further laws

464
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:14,480
that are often discriminating and

465
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,520
often don't really help the prostitution

466
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,000
protection act

467
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,559
has it and its core has an obligation to

468
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
register

469
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,918
all sex workers or tech which is

470
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,200
expected because sex workers have to

471
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,640
register

472
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,960
and a non-anonymous health counselling

473
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,600
that is also obligatory and the second

474
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,240
call is

475
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,199
the obligation to brothels to obtain

476
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,799
concessions and

477
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,120
one condition they have to fulfill is to

478
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,639
register all the sex workers and

479
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,719
to surveil them because the individual

480
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,160
sex workers are extremely hard to get

481
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,080
hold of

482
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,840
and other than by threatening the

483
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,000
brothel to withdraw their concession

484
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,760
if unregistered sex workers work there

485
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,400
so that's the much easier way to control

486
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,720
them

487
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,559
so i'll read about the obligation to

488
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,520
register because that is the item

489
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,360
that we criticize the most it

490
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,039
contradicts eu law

491
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,039
it conducts the general data protection

492
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:09,440
regulation

493
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:11,679
where data on sex work is

494
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,600
can only be used under very strictly

495
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,280
regulated conditions cannot be

496
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:21,199
registered otherwise and data about

497
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:25,039
professional sex work is very personal

498
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,200
obligatory registration and hall passes

499
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,679
while we are still legally discriminated

500
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,280
against and socially stigmatized

501
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,600
through numerous special rules in

502
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,399
criminal regulatory police or foreign

503
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,159
law as long as we are denied equal

504
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,039
treatment with other professions

505
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,360
and hor remains an insult we are fully

506
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,799
justified to seek anonymity to protect

507
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,959
ourselves

508
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,720
this protection is taken away from us if

509
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,600
we are obliged to register with

510
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,919
administrative

511
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,600
authorities which goes far beyond what

512
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,880
could be imposed through normal means of

513
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,360
commercial law

514
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,080
in return the state will take us and our

515
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,479
data into its tender caring hands

516
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,720
just to make it clear this is not about

517
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,640
a requirement to register as a resident

518
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,039
nor about the obligation to disclose

519
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,520
one's income for tax purposes

520
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,480
or this naturally applies to sex workers

521
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,158
anyway

522
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,320
neither is this about registering a

523
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,760
business because sex work is not

524
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,158
approved as a business

525
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,400
even though business tax has to be paid

526
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,559
on top of sales and income tax

527
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,320
by its nature sex work as a highly

528
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,080
personal service as it's called

529
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,520
is not a business but a freelance

530
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,520
occupation just like the one of a

531
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,200
therapist or artist

532
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,960
but approval as a freelancer in

533
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,559
commercial tax and building law is

534
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,120
denied to us as well

535
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,559
in tax terms sex work is accounted for

536
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,239
as other income

537
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,158
and instead of finally integrating our

538
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,159
profession into the legal system and

539
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,280
thus making another step towards legal

540
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,320
approval

541
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,000
new special rules are created

542
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,158
germany's so-called prostitutes

543
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,159
protection act of 2017

544
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,440
creates a whole database which is bad

545
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,520
enough in itself

546
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,520
and with it it makes every one time or

547
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,520
occasional sexual service for financial

548
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,360
gain subject to registration

549
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,960
a definition that goes far beyond the

550
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,799
requirements of registering a business

551
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,840
which has to be aimed for profit

552
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,918
over an extended period of time

553
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,760
the definition of sexual services in

554
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,799
paragraph 2 of this act

555
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,760
is contradictory including

556
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,200
sexually related sadistic or masochistic

557
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,679
acts

558
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,440
irrespective of whether physical touch

559
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,360
or genital intercourse between the

560
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,520
involved persons might occur

561
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,520
on the other hand the law says that

562
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,720
performances of an exclusively

563
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,200
depictional nato

564
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,360
nature where no other person present is

565
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,799
involved in an active sexual way

566
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,719
are not regarded as sexual services

567
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,918
does that mean that i am very much

568
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,000
permitted to

569
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,280
masturbate on a sofa in front of my

570
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,120
fully clothed guest

571
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,799
without having to the police storm out

572
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,719
the premises

573
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,960
only for the situation to change if i

574
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,000
grin at him and call him a little letter

575
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,080
as pig

576
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,600
nobody knows let's just have a bit of

577
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:13,840
water

578
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:13,840
this interpreter is having one too

579
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,080
and the health counselling every year

580
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,159
for sex workers between the age of 18

581
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,199
and 21 both is repeated at double

582
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,200
frequency

583
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,200
documents providing the registration and

584
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,039
participation in health counselling

585
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,720
have to be carried at all times next to

586
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,559
one's id card or passport

587
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,159
what fun if the whole pass with this

588
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,799
photo should fall into the hands of a

589
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,799
stranger

590
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,639
either because a purse is stolen or at a

591
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,600
back check in a club

592
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,400
through the photo the use of an alias on

593
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,840
the whole pass

594
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,520
becomes useless our right to

595
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,080
inviolability of the home

596
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,918
is impeded as well sex workers who want

597
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,760
to receive their guests at home

598
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,960
have to expect an inspection visit by

599
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,679
the authorities

600
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,960
just imagine that a call boy advertises

601
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,960
to a gay community

602
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,799
and occasionally has a discrete visit by

603
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,760
customers while the wife is away in the

604
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,480
office

605
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,280
and the children are at school at dinner

606
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,960
time

607
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,200
when wife and children are present of

608
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,799
course and maybe guests or superiors

609
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,960
of the wife as well there is a knock on

610
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,000
the door inspection visit to the

611
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,320
prostitutes protection

612
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,120
act are you mr p show us proof of

613
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,799
registration and your health card please

614
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,918
are any other prostitutes working here

615
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,600
without a brother license

616
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,679
i can hear voices in the kitchen we'll

617
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,918
have to check

618
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,240
a nightmare for sex workers who are not

619
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,679
out to everyone in their social contacts

620
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,720
and to those of their relatives and

621
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,919
friends

622
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,640
checks of the private home which is

623
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,039
normally protected by constitutional law

624
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,039
for a right

625
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,520
such an incursion into the basic rights

626
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,640
of a profession is only possible through

627
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,320
a special law

628
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,400
this is about protection not about

629
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,559
protection but about total control

630
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,400
an obligation to register turns us into

631
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,799
objects of further ingressions into our

632
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,799
rights

633
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,360
and the last chapter

634
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,840
the political outlook

635
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,158
there is no way of dressing up the

636
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,080
current

637
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,600
fundamentally misguided legislation

638
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,600
which leads to the question what the

639
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,760
future of sex work could look like

640
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,799
politically socially and personally for

641
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,960
me

642
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,120
the main focus in my opinion has to be

643
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,799
on the abolition of the discriminatory

644
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,799
special treatment by law

645
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,400
that sex workers and their surroundings

646
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,320
are subjected to

647
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,480
this is about the respective parts of

648
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,039
criminal and regulatory law

649
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,080
as well as a repeal of the unspeakable

650
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,080
prostitute's protection

651
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,240
in many places non-prostitution zones

652
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,000
create a de facto occupational ban

653
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,640
and create a massive problem for sex

654
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,360
workers where the interests of residents

655
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,400
other businesses and sex workers do come

656
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,639
into conflict

657
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,039
pragmatic solutions instead of blanket

658
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,440
bans can be found

659
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,080
further to that sex work needs to be

660
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,080
recognized

661
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,678
as a freelance occupation in tax

662
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,678
commercial and building law

663
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,200
a regulation of brothel establishments

664
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,320
through commercial and industrial

665
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,919
protection law

666
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,760
must aim to protect the working

667
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,320
conditions of sex workers

668
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,679
and the legal security of the operators

669
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,639
it must never be used

670
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,960
as a means of prostitution containment

671
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,720
for moral or ideological reasons

672
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,159
or as an instrument of general politics

673
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,559
sorry and as an instrument of general

674
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,400
police surveillance any such rules must

675
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,639
be developed in close cooperation with

676
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,360
people from the industry

677
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,320
knowledge is power and there already are

678
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,959
outstanding

679
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,799
functioning concepts and models for

680
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,279
education and professionalization in

681
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,240
such and

682
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,159
sex work such education project must be

683
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,880
supported everywhere

684
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,960
as soon as the voluntary participation

685
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,240
in workshops and visits by qualified

686
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,480
trainers in brothels

687
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,559
have become as normal as today's rates

688
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,000
by police tax inspectors and other

689
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,200
controlling authorities

690
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,200
we will have gained a lot

691
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,520
with all political measures the

692
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,600
intention to take people in sex work

693
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,840
seriously instead of patronizing them

694
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,840
will be of paramount importance

695
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,799
it is fundamental to recognize sex work

696
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,880
as a legitimate choice

697
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,720
without reservations and to overcome

698
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,279
stigmatization of the living

699
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,000
and working conditions if the living and

700
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,480
working conditions

701
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,400
of sex workers are to be improved it is

702
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,840
time that our contribution to the sexual

703
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,720
and emotional well-being of our

704
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,600
customers

705
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,200
and thus of society is acknowledged as

706
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,520
care work

707
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,520
if a person who is about to apply for

708
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,279
any job can state in their cv

709
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,879
that they had previously been a sex

710
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,080
worker on the freelance a regular

711
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,159
employment basis

712
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,080
without having to fear disadvantages

713
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,400
then i would consider that our goal has

714
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,039
been reached

715
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,840
thank you that is what i was going to

716
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,720
read

717
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,199
and now i'm very much looking forward to

718
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,679
your

719
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,679
questions

720
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:24,080
and what sarah would like to know for me

721
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,080
yeah thank you

722
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,479
thank you i've read the text yesterday

723
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:34,399
already and it was very

724
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:37,760
um interesting yeah

725
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:40,959
protection law i didn't know about that

726
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:44,399
i had no idea about that

727
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,960
as every person i have a point of view

728
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:49,840
about

729
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,840
prostitution and sex work but

730
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,480
are some other questions too but now i'm

731
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:08,000
using my privilege to

732
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:12,559
uh put my password

733
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,559
out there for them

734
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,399
yes i

735
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,159
was part of drawing up a complaint at

736
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:25,120
the federal constitutional

737
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,039
court against the prostitution

738
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,559
protection act

739
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,879
that was rejected by the constitutional

740
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,879
court

741
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:39,279
[Music]

742
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,760
exceptionally deal with a law if you ask

743
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,679
a director you have to

744
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,360
go through the courts the lower courts

745
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,120
the lower levels of the court system

746
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,039
first and in this case the

747
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,719
constitutional courts did not make that

748
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:54,960
exception and accept a direct complaint

749
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,399
at the time the prostitution protection

750
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,960
act came into force

751
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,000
very sadly because we went to a lot of

752
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,520
trouble

753
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,440
so we have to go through the courts now

754
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,600
and i'm not aware that this is already

755
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,720
happening that any colleague

756
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:14,240
has filed a complaint in any court

757
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,640
about any such fines that they faced and

758
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,080
then

759
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,559
went from the various levels

760
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,360
we'll have to see if that works and how

761
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:26,960
that happens and how it goes

762
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:31,120
yeah and maybe this is

763
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,120
a matter of crowdfunding

764
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:38,080
so maybe someone has to go

765
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,440
for themselves into the ring and start a

766
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,279
lawsuit

767
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,559
i mean this is not only in the interest

768
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,200
of one side but

769
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,879
it's in the interest of everything yes

770
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,279
and we're not at the end

771
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,159
i don't believe that the financial issue

772
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,520
is the

773
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,679
hardest thing but it's about outing

774
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,559
the involved people huge media coverage

775
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,840
will follow

776
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:03,440
it would be good if uh

777
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,439
a fine would be issued

778
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,200
but otherwise we just have to wait and

779
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,159
see who of

780
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,960
the um people that are currently

781
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,000
affected

782
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:19,760
not me um will show up

783
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
and of course it will be those that work

784
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,039
on the streets

785
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,960
that are more visible and work in

786
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,520
precarious situations

787
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,240
and these are often people colleagues

788
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,760
who are

789
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,840
happy to have the whole thing behind

790
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,600
them and that maybe have been

791
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,600
criminalized in more than one way i live

792
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,158
in the hamburg area of south kork where

793
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,039
i have lots of contact with colleagues

794
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,679
who are out there on three walking in

795
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,158
the district

796
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,799
there are non-prostitution zones to be

797
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,000
dealt with

798
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,200
some of these people are violating drug

799
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,120
laws

800
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,320
so they would say okay that's just

801
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,439
another

802
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,960
fee to be present on site uh

803
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:04,080
i don't really care what i pay for so

804
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,919
that's how i see it and

805
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,080
there are often no good alternatives

806
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,840
either

807
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:19,840
okay i will start to go through

808
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:19,840
questions um

809
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:29,519
[Music]

810
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,480
i'll talk about the swedish model too if

811
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,480
anyone wants to

812
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,760
there were many many things thanks from

813
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,600
the chat so

814
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:48,640
very good good um

815
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,639
let's start from the top

816
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,559
measurements would you see as

817
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,320
well

818
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,840
that is of course not something that we

819
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,360
can solve within

820
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,959
the trade it's not just exploitation and

821
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:13,519
sex work but

822
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:16,880
sex work is one of the kinds of work

823
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:19,279
that do not require a formal education

824
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,880
and that way these people in the

825
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:24,480
non-formally educated can still

826
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:28,480
earn good money and

827
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,480
of course due to migrations

828
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,960
disparities people's status might not be

829
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,279
accepted

830
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,840
people that can earn more money much

831
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,880
more than they can earn at home

832
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,559
so you often have a situation where

833
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,799
people come coming to germany as a

834
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,799
couple

835
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:57,840
um husband gets broken down

836
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,840
in the vice

837
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,279
i would like a situation where no one

838
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:08,080
has to do anything that damages them

839
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:10,159
and the only way to achieve that is to

840
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,918
eradicate poverty and fight poverty

841
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:16,960
and and abolish income disparities and

842
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,640
have a more equal society

843
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,880
the first thing i would wish for is an

844
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,519
unconditional basic income

845
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,600
and in sex work two people only people

846
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,080
should work who at least feel okay with

847
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,639
doing that under conditions

848
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,360
that are reasonable that is very clear

849
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,880
but i

850
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,439
don't believe that this only happens

851
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,600
in our industry or that can only be

852
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,720
solved within our industry

853
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:46,000
i see the same way i yeah

854
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:50,840
think of very different industries maybe

855
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:54,080
meat industry construction industry

856
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:57,840
yes this is not only to see

857
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:00,639
in itself but it's societal

858
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,000
yes and what is specific to us is that

859
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,000
extra problem of

860
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,639
discrimination and stigmatization

861
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,918
is further pressure if that is applied

862
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,839
to people

863
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,279
uh if people can be exerted by saying

864
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,040
you are a and you cannot go

865
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,200
anywhere else now

866
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,239
of course that is how it goes that

867
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:21,918
people try

868
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:24,319
to exploit exploit then

869
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,118
they try to also isolate those people

870
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,040
and

871
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,879
the affected people and they cut them

872
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,199
off from their support systems from

873
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,799
their social circles

874
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,279
using the argument that these people

875
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,720
would never understand

876
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:41,919
so that in turn could be improved

877
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:46,399
by a social change where social work

878
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:49,759
is accepted and no longer stigmatized so

879
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:53,040
i think that a

880
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,200
legal normalization and an introduction

881
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,040
inclusion in normal commercial law and

882
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,720
other laws as a free

883
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,240
occupation as a freelance occupation

884
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,279
that is one strand that should be

885
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,040
followed and if i had

886
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:08,720
money which i do not have i would

887
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,279
fund campaigns such as the campaign of

888
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,720
the

889
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:16,160
eight supporting groups that managed

890
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,240
the achieved change and made hates an

891
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,440
acceptable subject to talk about and

892
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:24,560
which can be talked about with humor and

893
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,960
not so much embarrassment and

894
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,599
to have safer sex further i could

895
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,320
imagine

896
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,200
that campaigns to treat sex workers with

897
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,720
respect

898
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:38,480
could achieve something but you need

899
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,759
the funds look at what happened in

900
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,760
stuttgart a few months ago

901
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,400
where the corona crisis was

902
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,040
severely abused for a campaign against

903
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,040
sex workers

904
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,839
a member of the german parliament from

905
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,839
stuttgart

906
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,598
a prohibition on purchasing sex work in

907
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,320
germany

908
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,200
so prohibition on the buyers side and

909
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,680
there is a whole

910
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,319
tale of other regulations that they

911
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,799
would like to introduce as well

912
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,800
so that

913
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,960
created a campaign switch off the red

914
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,359
light

915
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,839
with uh slogans that i don't even want

916
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:28,000
to repeat

917
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:29,200
advice where sex workers and their

918
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,599
customers were

919
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,319
degraded in a way that was worse than

920
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,640
happens

921
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,240
in our trade even those that are have

922
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,400
completely lost

923
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,959
any sensitivities any any reason so if

924
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,240
if money was put in such campaigns i

925
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,960
would consider that helpful

926
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,000
yeah yeah yeah i i've seen those

927
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,480
campaigns and

928
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,480
it was very cringy

929
00:36:53,119 --> 00:37:00,880
yes all we can do is this was

930
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,879
very horrible let's go on

931
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,319
now my heart is speaking or not

932
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,839
numbers

933
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:16,199
[Music]

934
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,680
beyond the sex workers the um

935
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,118
how many women non-binaries are there

936
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,960
and what i'm interested in

937
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:33,280
is also um that's the

938
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,599
what's the question from the audience my

939
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,720
question

940
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:42,000
are is numbers um

941
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:45,520
you always talk about um

942
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,040
enforce violation enforce prostitution

943
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:52,960
and there are people who

944
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:56,640
do it on a liberal

945
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:59,839
way liberal deliberately and um

946
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:03,440
those whose passport are robbed and

947
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,320
something oh yeah there's a lot to say

948
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,000
though

949
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:11,040
about the distribution

950
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,440
genders there is figures numbers are

951
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,640
always

952
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:18,400
changing and not very reliable but about

953
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:21,920
80 cis women 10 men

954
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,040
and 10 other diverse genders of some

955
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,640
form

956
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:30,839
can be found that is a very rough figure

957
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:33,839
according to my knowledge my personal

958
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,839
perception

959
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,440
because my perception is surely my

960
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,279
sample is not representative

961
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,800
as far as my personal network is

962
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,599
concerned i

963
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,040
know mostly women because i am not

964
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,480
really part of the streetwalking

965
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,320
community

966
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:56,960
i know male sex workers

967
00:38:52,320 --> 00:39:00,800
mostly that are involved

968
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,280
and and in the professional associations

969
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:08,480
but mostly women

970
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,480
um and regarding numbers

971
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,000
on voluntary sex work

972
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,800
i think it's very important to

973
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:20,399
distinguish between

974
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:23,280
self-determination and self-realization

975
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,839
which is because there are often

976
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,680
different

977
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:30,640
measures put upon sex

978
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,240
compared to other professions i am one

979
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,240
of the people that really realize their

980
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,160
desires in sex work

981
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,640
that is not a precondition for a

982
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,879
self-determination

983
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,078
in sex work so someone who says okay i

984
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,280
don't like that job that

985
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,000
much but it is the best

986
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,000
way i have

987
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,839
for a work life balance that is okay for

988
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,920
the income i can achieve and compare to

989
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,839
other options so under these

990
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,440
circumstances sex work too

991
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:04,960
i know um i know

992
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,680
has to be legal or

993
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,319
acceptable as a choice as long as we

994
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,520
live in a capitalist system as we do

995
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:16,880
so if i cannot choose between different

996
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:20,319
jobs i have to choose to

997
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,240
earn my daily bread then i have to be

998
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:24,079
able to decide for something that i

999
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,839
maybe maybe don't find great but i guess

1000
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,280
they'll opt for because the alternatives

1001
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,520
aren't any better either

1002
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,520
um

1003
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:35,680
and then regarding the other side the

1004
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,680
share of

1005
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,839
um

1006
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,040
human trafficking for sexual

1007
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,319
exploitation as the

1008
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,440
legal term was that was then renamed

1009
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,839
to enforced or cursed prostitution in

1010
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,079
the

1011
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,240
protection into prostitutes protection

1012
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:01,760
act

1013
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:06,160
i think per year in the last few decades

1014
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:11,280
we've had

1015
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:14,480
100 convicted

1016
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,319
convictions in red light criminality as

1017
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,839
it's called and that includes

1018
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:21,839
exploitation of prostitutes that is one

1019
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,839
paragraph

1020
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,800
which used to be called human

1021
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,959
trafficking for sexual exploitation

1022
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:38,079
we have a few hundred investigations

1023
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,800
and below 100

1024
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,599
convictions from the courts and the

1025
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,640
statistics

1026
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,640
of culprits versus victims

1027
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,839
is

1028
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,280
an unknown figure which no one knows and

1029
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,200
people like to claim that this is so

1030
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,000
astronomically high that

1031
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,598
99 say of all sex workers are in

1032
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,839
enforced prostitution

1033
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,839
um that of course is complete nonsense

1034
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,839
if you have the ten percent of those

1035
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:23,359
yes so let's assume that there is an

1036
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,560
unknown figure that maybe is about as

1037
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,040
high as the

1038
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,160
unknown figure and other sexual

1039
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,759
transgressions

1040
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,440
rapes and so on which has an extremely

1041
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,359
high unknown

1042
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,280
number because these are extreme but

1043
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:37,359
also very stigmatized

1044
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,800
events and there are very few

1045
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,880
convictions that's about

1046
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,599
one conviction in 20 cases so let's

1047
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,760
assume that of these 100 victims

1048
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,440
from these 100 actually convicted

1049
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,960
victims we can conclude that there are

1050
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,520
2 000 per year and let's assume that we

1051
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,040
have an

1052
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,040
estimated number we still haven't any

1053
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,119
exact figures

1054
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,240
there are figures from 60 to four

1055
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,760
hundred thousand

1056
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,359
thousand that are given so let's assume

1057
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,400
we have two hundred thousand to keep it

1058
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:05,440
simple

1059
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,160
so then we have two thousand cases

1060
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,720
within two hundred thousand sex workers

1061
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,040
that would be

1062
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,200
one percent including all the other area

1063
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,240
of the grey areas

1064
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,598
so yeah for actual

1065
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:22,720
criminal exploitation of any kind

1066
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:26,319
that is far away

1067
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,319
from what people like to claim

1068
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,400
this is a game with numbers we don't

1069
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,720
have any reliable lead reliability but

1070
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,160
this

1071
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:39,680
is what i deduce from what i can see

1072
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,000
and in my time of work have been doing

1073
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,960
this

1074
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,800
for i didn't get the number of years so

1075
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,520
cases of criminal exploitation i only

1076
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:55,839
got to know about

1077
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:55,839
through counselling services

1078
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,560
through my work in the professional

1079
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:13,839
association

1080
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:15,920
the colleagues i know and so on so this

1081
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:19,040
is not a phenomenon that

1082
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:22,400
in any form represents the everyday

1083
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,400
experience of sex workers

1084
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,040
of course this will be a bell curve

1085
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,800
there will be those that say okay this

1086
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:36,560
is great i love my job and on the

1087
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,560
other side there will be people

1088
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,439
[Music]

1089
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,749
[Music]

1090
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:35,200
for years i was just working alone

1091
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,720
and found the whole thing rather normal

1092
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,359
and then i heard from all sides oh my

1093
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,439
god

1094
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:41,759
people are being exploited and i'm

1095
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,480
chained to walls and i always thought

1096
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,119
my goodness which world am i living in

1097
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,119
and then i worked

1098
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,520
ask myself what do they mean am i blind

1099
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,160
and

1100
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,880
many of this is simply propaganda these

1101
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,240
are

1102
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:03,119
stories that are often invented because

1103
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,118
they are gruesome

1104
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:10,079
because stories like that stick much

1105
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:15,839
more than a normal

1106
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:15,839
professional career and that's the banal

1107
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:22,240
[Music]

1108
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,480
and i think has been working for 25

1109
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,479
years

1110
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:31,040
there's a great movie from lena

1111
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:32,960
morgenhorde another protagonist

1112
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,319
which is a great movie because it shows

1113
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,839
the banality

1114
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:40,160
of every day of the of the everyday work

1115
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:42,799
so you have lena reading the paper

1116
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:46,319
riding the underground

1117
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,839
making calls and sometimes dealing with

1118
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:49,920
customers i think this is a fantastic

1119
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,839
movie

1120
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,319
and i can really recommend it i really

1121
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,319
recommend it

1122
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,598
a sex workers sex in germany is the

1123
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,480
title of the movie and lena morgenhold

1124
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:02,480
is the protagonist

1125
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,000
working in computer science now which

1126
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,760
was her study

1127
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,800
there i remember you said you have links

1128
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,839
and maybe um

1129
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:23,040

chat

1136
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:38,800

but the association does have a presence

1147
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,640

1148
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:08,240
so ways to support us by sharing

the following and how you can get in

1150
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,919

00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,558
we have 12 more minutes there's summer

1155
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,799
question

1156
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,880
one is a little about what you said in

1157
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,680
the last three sentences

1158
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,680
i try to

1159
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,839
sort it

1160
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:47,098
[Music]

1161
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,599
swedish model we talked about this

1162
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:01,119
earlier

1163
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,160
and positive examples from other eu

1164
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,920
countries

1165
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:09,680
i think the one very important

1166
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,680
well there's a interesting question

1167
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:19,279
but i would ask you for shorter answers

1168
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,160
i think we could talk all afternoon and

1169
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,520
evening

1170
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:26,799
together here that's very

1171
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:31,040
interesting how to ally

1172
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:34,559
yes can i be a good ally

1173
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,759
for you how do i get into contact with

1174
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:40,880
sex workers

1175
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,880
to um yeah to reconsider their

1176
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,040
what they want yes

1177
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,599
well for one thing the links that i'm

1178
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:53,119
going to post on twitter

1179
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,440
are helpful to follow us and read more

1180
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,359
about

1181
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,839
us and what i find very important

1182
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:01,520
is the difference between a rescuer and

1183
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:03,440
a supporter

1184
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,680
or a savior and a supporter because i

1185
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,160
like to rate against the so-called

1186
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,480
rescue industry and that's a very simple

1187
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,440
summary if you look at the dramatic

1188
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,200
triangle here

1189
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,520
there is a dysfunctional relationship

1190
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:18,558
model between rescuers

1191
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:20,559
culprits and victims it needs all three

1192
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:22,240
parts to keep the game going

1193
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,240
so if those that are interested there is

1194
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,799
a good wikipedia article the dramatic

1195
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,799
triangle

1196
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,839
many people want to be able to stay

1197
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:37,119
within that triangle because

1198
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:39,520
they identify as rescuers or saviors

1199
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,640
and because they need this for their

1200
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,520
identity

1201
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,078
so they are worried that the victims

1202
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,520
should not

1203
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:50,319
exit from their victim role

1204
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,960
because then the others might be moved

1205
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,839
into the

1206
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,760
cockpit corner perhaps so the task is to

1207
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:59,119
get out of that dramatic triangle

1208
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:01,839
and stop this game and good allies

1209
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,599
are keeping that space clear and use

1210
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:09,119
their privileges

1211
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:11,200
to give us our voice

1212
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,040
is a marginalized situation and that

1213
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,839
doesn't that doesn't apply just to sex

1214
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,079
workers

1215
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:18,319
they stand back and let these people

1216
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,359
take the stage and i've seen that so

1217
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,359
much

1218
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:23,520
when i started getting engaged they were

1219
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:26,400
wonderful people who had a standing

1220
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:28,000
who had professional professorships who

1221
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,960
were asked

1222
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,160
as speakers in conferences or to write

1223
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,400
books

1224
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,558
they said i'm not going to do this but i

1225
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,359
know someone who can do it

1226
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:41,920
and that touches me and it brings me to

1227
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:45,520
tears sometimes that is incredible

1228
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:48,960
so that is very helpful and also

1229
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:50,960
to talk about it and if there are

1230
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,720
any dead hooker jokes in the

1231
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,319
surroundings please stop them from doing

1232
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,558
that please

1233
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:58,800
i think this is like with our

1234
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:03,040
marginalized groups

1235
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:04,800
yes exactly especially

1236
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,480
also here in chaos there are a lot of

1237
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,570
marginalized groups

1238
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,839
most will remember some um

1239
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:15,440
[Music]

1240
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:17,440
yes part of

1241
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,520
women who you

1242
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,240
[Music]

1243
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:24,079
i have fewer women as customers but they

1244
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:27,598
do exist

1245
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:29,040
often as part of a couple that is quite

1246
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,280
frequent

1247
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,119
that couples are visiting me but women

1248
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,240
alone do visit me

1249
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,240
increasingly in fact

1250
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:40,558
okay thank you

1251
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,839
i don't really know what is behind it

1252
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:54,480
uh just briefly

1253
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:58,240
i would like to also say that from

1254
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,880
5 pm we have an assembly the red light

1255
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,000
hacks

1256
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,559
and every evening we have a one hour ask

1257
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,119
the sex

1258
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:09,040
worker round table and i will be in

1259
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:09,040
there from 5 p.m and dennis too

1260
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:16,480
talked about sex work he'll be involved

1261
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,960
and from six we will continue with how

1262
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,040
to be

1263
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:23,200
a good client q a with some colleagues

1264
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,359
i think i'll stay on for that so if you

1265
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:28,558
want to be involved with that from five

1266
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:30,160
in our assembly and also the swedish

1267
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:32,880
model very briefly

1268
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,598
at its core is the prohibition to

1269
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,000
purchase

1270
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,760
sex work so the demand side is

1271
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,319
criminalized which is complete nonsense

1272
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:43,839
of course

1273
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:43,839
because um in that whole

1274
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,079
as a sex worker very much more difficult

1275
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,480
or

1276
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,480
impossible screening your customers

1277
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,240
makes leads to customers no longer

1278
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,000
disclosing their disclosing their

1279
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,879
identities

1280
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,440
and sex workers uh are then forced to

1281
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,839
work

1282
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,680
in hiding and the structure then is

1283
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:08,160
transformed we know this in hamburg and

1284
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:12,640
the district of saint george there is a

1285
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:15,839
an ordination to prohibit contact which

1286
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:18,240
forbids prostitutes from getting in

1287
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:20,558
touch for bookings so customers oh that

1288
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:22,799
forbids people from getting in touch so

1289
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,400
that people that want to avoid being

1290
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,240
fined are staying away and

1291
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,680
the only ones that remain are those that

1292
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:31,040
don't care

1293
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:33,040
and who maybe are

1294
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:39,839
more difficult as customers for other

1295
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:39,839
reasons connected reasons

1296
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:03,129
[Music]

1297
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:07,839
is

1298
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:20,880
telling each other where they are going

1299
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,879
which car they are getting

1300
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:39,599
parents in need of care or children or

1301
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,599
partners that have become unemployed

1302
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:48,720
then these partners or children could be

1303
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:51,520
indicted with pimping

1304
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:53,118
the sex workers that 100 exit from the

1305
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,599
trade will receive support

1306
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,920
it's impossible to say i want to take on

1307
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:00,000
another job and maybe on the side

1308
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,960
continue with a bit of sex work that's

1309
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,640
impossible

1310
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,480
counseling services are not allowed to

1311
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:07,118
hand out condoms because that is

1312
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,799
furthering support of prostitution so

1313
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:12,880
it's a whole

1314
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:14,960
and sweden uh

1315
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,200
is selling this model worldwide as a

1316
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:21,280
panacea and

1317
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:25,520
we really say thanks but no thanks

1318
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,520
and then i would say the last question

1319
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:32,558
there are a lot of interesting questions

1320
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:37,598
and you can come to the happening and

1321
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,880
ask your questions

1322
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:40,880
and maybe i will come too

1323
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:49,760
on which political areas

1324
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:54,160
do you have concrete demands

1325
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:57,599
is it just federal or state

1326
00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:02,078
um yeah and thank you

1327
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:05,040
everyone i have demands for everyone um

1328
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:06,400
this prostitution prostitutes protection

1329
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,400
act of course has to be

1330
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,559
repealed that is a demand to the german

1331
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,680
government but the individual

1332
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:15,359
communes that implement this law are

1333
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,040
treating this very differently

1334
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,880
hamburg has established its own

1335
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:21,119
authority that really tries

1336
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,480
to implement the prostitutes protection

1337
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:26,000
act in a

1338
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,920
way that is as good

1339
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,760
as possible so but they have to

1340
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,599
implement a restrictive law

1341
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,040
in other communes it was taken over by

1342
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:36,400
the police directly

1343
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:38,799
who have been

1344
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,319
compiling databases on halls anyway

1345
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:43,200
without legal foundations

1346
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:44,160
now using that law to get rid of

1347
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,240
undesirable

1348
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,440
brothels where it was not possible

1349
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,919
before

1350
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,280
by perhaps inventing more and more

1351
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:55,119
conditions

1352
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,960
make it impossible to do the work

1353
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,559
different communes in different federal

1354
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,760
states in germany have different

1355
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:03,520
fights and we

1356
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,760
somehow just say we have to repeal that

1357
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:07,040
law and the other special laws that are

1358
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,000
about

1359
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,960
very different questions at the city

1360
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,119
level perhaps

1361
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,599
there's that happens everywhere in

1362
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,599
principle

1363
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:22,160
fine

1364

[Music]

1365
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:35,759
good is the networking between sex

1366
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,000
workers

1367
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,760
is there can you do like a general

00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,880
statement

1369
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,079
well personally i regard that networking

1370
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,720
is very very good

1371
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:48,960
of course there are frictions within our

1372
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,160
association too this is a huge and very

1373
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,880
varied bunch

1374
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,920
and very democratic grassroots

1375
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,160
democratic and i am

1376
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,000
a member of other networks that are not

1377
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:00,720
organized in this way

1378
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,559
i think the collegial atmosphere is very

1379
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:05,118
good

1380
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:06,079
and i have many friendships within sex

1381
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:07,680
work

1382
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,440
most of my friends are either sex

1383
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:13,040
workers or kind of

1384
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:15,680
kinky i myself i'm a psycho masochist

1385
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:17,119
and i have lots of contacts there to

1386
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:20,558
people that at least are

1387
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:23,119
positively inclined or sex work

1388
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:24,559
and that works very very well much

1389
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:26,960
better than you might assume from the

1390
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,960
outside

1391
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,160
mentioned

1392
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:50,000
