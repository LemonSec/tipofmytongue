greeting creatures in neuland in 2015

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,160
governments from around the world met in

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,720
paris and agreed to

change

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,720
to well below 2 degrees unfortunately

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,000
it seems that since then we have not

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,800
done enough and the climate

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,680
crisis has only gotten more urgent our

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,320
next speaker

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,760
stefan ramsdorf has more accolades than

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,200
i have time to tell

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,120
he's published more than a hundred

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,160
papers including in the journal's nature

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,399
and science

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,160
co-authored four books and won the

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,920

welcome him

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,840
and heed his advice here's stefan

24
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,520
hi everyone my name is stefan ramstov

25
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,560
and i'm thrilled to be invited to give a

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,600
talk

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:20,320
at the chaos computer club's

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:23,039
remote chaos experience 2020

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,758
i want to give you an overview of a

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,759
climate

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:32,079
tipping point very exciting subject

32
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,079
that i will try to shed some light on

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,759
but let's first start with some

34
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,240
background on

35
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,880
climate change you probably know this

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,479
image it shows the global temperature

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,920
evolution since the year 1880 every line

38
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,640
is one year

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,960
this is the more conventional way of

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,079
viewing this time series

41
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,039
and the last seven years have been

42
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,919
the hottest seven years since record

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,000
keeping

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,000
began in the 19th century

45
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,318
we know the reason for this warming it's

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,239
the increase of carbon dioxide which you

47
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:13,519
can see here for the last 10

48
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,120
000 years and if you just look at the

49
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,160
end of the curve

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,360
how the increase has accelerated

51
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,319
in ever shorter time spans we have seen

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,720
an ever greater increase in the amount

53
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,920
of

54
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,280
carbon dioxide in our planet's

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,839
atmosphere this

56
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,160
increase causes what we call a radiator

57
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,080
forcing

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,560
that is a kind of heating in terms of

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,920
energy released per square meter of

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,480
earth's surface

61
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,799
and the increase in co2 in the

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,119
atmosphere until now

63
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,200
is causing a heating at a rate of 2

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,200
watts per square meter earth surface

65
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,480
we understand the energy budget of our

66
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,720
planet pretty well

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,200
on the left here in this diagram you can

68
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,159
see the incoming solar radiation in

69
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,640
yellow

70
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,280
part of that is reflected already in the

71
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,518
atmosphere by the clouds for example

72
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,280
another part is reflected by the bright

73
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,519
surfaces

74
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,440
that's the snow and ice surfaces

75
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,720
primarily

76
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,120
and the rest is absorbed on the right

77
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,440
hand side and let's zoom into that

78
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,239
you see in orange the long wave

79
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,079
radiation

80
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,959
which is clearly distinct from the

81
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,080
incoming shortwave solar radiation

82
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,879
by its wavelength and

83
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,280
this thick arrow of long wave radiation

84
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,518
leaving the earth's surface

85
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,760
basically to a large extent gets

86
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,799
absorbed by the atmosphere

87
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,679
and the atmosphere itself emits

88
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,560
like anything any substance any matter

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,799
at a

90
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,680
depending on its surface temperature on

91
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,720
it sorry

92
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,480
depending on its temperature emits also

93
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,200
infrared radiation and

94
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,679
one thing that few people realize is

95
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,640
that

96
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,760
the back radiation coming down from the

97
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,238
atmosphere

98
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,679
through the greenhouse effect the

99
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,478
greenhouse gases

100
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,519
is actually twice as large as the

101
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,560
earth's surface

102
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,199
as the absorbed solar radiation so

103
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,680
heating by the greenhouse effect by the

104
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,160
long wave radiation is twice as big

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,080
as the absorbed solar radiation at the

106
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,800
earth's surface

107
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,080
and so it's little wonder that if we are

108
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,199
increasing this

109
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,840
natural greenhouse effect which actually

110
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,560
makes our planet livable in the first

111
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,799
place

112
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,680
if we are increasing this effect that it

113
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,400
is going to

114
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,400
get warmer

115
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:54,560
we can also quantify this effect and

116
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,880
if you add in not just the co2 increase

117
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,440
but

118
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,320
other human caused greenhouse gases and

119
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,759
also cooling effects caused by humans

120
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,759
then you see that the total human caused

121
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,840
warming that we see here in the orange

122
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,800
bar is to within

123
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,599
uncertainty big

124
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,520
as the observed global warming since the

125
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,199
1950s

126
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,599
and that means that about 100 percent

127
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,440
of the observed global warming over the

128
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,039
past 70 years

129
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,199
is human cost and the best estimates of

130
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,400
the human cost warming is actually even

131
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,600
slightly more

132
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,080
than the observed warming which has to

133
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,720
do

134
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,359
partly or is consistent with the fact

135
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,080
that

136
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,000
solar activity has gone down so the

137
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,479
decrease in solar activity

138
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,039
has compensated a small part of the

139
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,320
human

140
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,320
caused global warming

141
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,119
it's also very interesting and

142
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,840
especially to me

143
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,400
as a paleo climatologist who studies

144
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,119
natural

145
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,560
climate variations in earth history and

146
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,919
has done so

147
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,560
for more than 25 years how the modern

148
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,680
warming

149
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,720
compares with the

150
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,600
changes in the throughout the holocene

151
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,039
and before that since the last ice age

152
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,240
and this is what we see here based

153
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,120
on decades of paleoclimate research

154
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,000
countless sediment cores taken at the

155
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,880
sea bottom

156
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,680
ice cores on the big ice sheets and so

157
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,680
on

158
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,720
we have enough data now to form

159
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,199
meaningful global average temperatures

160
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,880
and you can see here the warming from

161
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,240
the height of the last ice age

162
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,000
into the holocene um the holocene

163
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,680
optimum the warmest period

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,240
about uh until about 5000 years before

165
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,280
present

166
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,319
and since then we have seen a very

167
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,599
slow cooling trend

168
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,400
which we have bent around due to human

169
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,599
activities

170
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:03,120
and we have within a hundred years

171
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,240
more than undone 5000 years of natural

172
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,720
cooling trend

173
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,319
which normally would have very slowly

174
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,800
continued

175
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,360
these natural variations by the way are

176
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,759
due to the earth orbital cycles

177
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,560
the so-called milankovitch cycles you

178
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,880
can easily

179
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,680
read up on those for example at

180
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,680
wikipedia

181
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:27,919
[Music]

182
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,840
now let's come to the famous much feared

183
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,840
tipping points in the climate system

184
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:39,919
what is a tipping point that has been

185
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,960
described in a seminal paper which i'm

186
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,000
proud of having been a part of

187
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,919
from 2008

188
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,919
by tim lenten and colleagues and

189
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,758
this is called tipping elements in the

190
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,960
earth's climate system

191
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:00,319
and it says that the term tipping point

192
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,638
commonly refers to a critical threshold

193
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,120
at which a tiny perturbation can

194
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,319
qualitatively alter the state

195
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,080
or development of a system

196
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,240
and the different parts of the earth

197
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,400
system which can undergo

198
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,960
such a transition they are called the

199
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,000
tipping elements

200
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,878
this whole concept is illustrated

201
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,280
in the red line that's shown here in the

202
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,000
horizontal axis we see a control

203
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,400
parameter

204
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,160
and that could be the greenhouse gas

205
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,360
content of our atmosphere

206
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,360
it could be the temperature it could be

207
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,360
if you talk about natural climate

208
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,320
changes for example those

209
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,640
orbital changes the what we call the

210
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,440
milankovitch forcing

211
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,800
which drives changes and on the vertical

212
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,680
axis you see the

213
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,479
response and if you imagine the control

214
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,479
parameter

215
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,320
changing from left to right in this

216
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,080
diagram you would

217
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:01,200
march along that upper part of the red

218
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,040
curve here the branch until you come

219
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,760
close to a threshold and at that

220
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,680
threshold the system will undergo

221
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:12,240
a major change and reach then

222
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,920
this lower part of the curve a different

223
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,920
kind of equilibrium state

224
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,519
so it's basically a small change in the

225
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,119
driver

226
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:28,959
causing a very big systemic response

227
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,959
that is what defines a tipping point

228
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,600
if we want to be a very accurate here we

229
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,079
can distinguish two different types of

230
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,160
tipping points the first one

231
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,839
is what i just showed you is repeated

232
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,279
here on the left side and it is

233
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,720
characterized

234
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,839
by the fact that this red equilibrium

235
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,959
line

236
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,000
has one state for every point on the

237
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,199
x-axis so

238
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,399
every amount of forcing corresponds to

239
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,040
one particular system state and this

240
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,240
system

241
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,360
state just makes a major transition in a

242
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,560
small

243
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,839
range of the driving parameter

244
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,359
around this threshold now a second

245
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:14,000
even more drastic

246
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,240
or non-linear type of tipping point is

247
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,959
shown in the right hand side

248
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,640
where the equilibrium states are

249
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,439
somewhat more complex than

250
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,720
the single red line on the left you can

251
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,360
see here

252
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,160
that there is again an upper stable

253
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,560
branch

254
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,279
and there is also a lower stable branch

255
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,560
but they

256
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,000
overlap so there is a region that is

257
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,439
shaded here

258
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,160
where two stable equilibria

259
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,519
exist and it depends on the initial

260
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,279
conditions

261
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,880
on which of these branches you are

262
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,079
now there is a what is called a

263
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,680
bifurcation

264
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:58,640
bifurcation structure underlying this

265
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,000
with a bifurcation point

266
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:05,279
there is a an unstable branch which

267
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,399
separates the basins of attraction of

268
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,439
the two stable branches so if you're in

269
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,839
the bistable

270
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,480
regime and you start kind of away from

271
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,720
an equilibrium but above the dashed line

272
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,519
you will fall up onto that upper stable

273
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,519
branch

274
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,800
if you start out below the dashed line

275
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,680
you will fall down on the

276
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,319
lower branch that actually is pretty

277
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,640
standard

278
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,600
non-linear dynamics it's a whole branch

279
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,160
of physics

280
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,839
which investigates exactly this time

281
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,120
type of behavior

282
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:38,240
in many different physical systems

283
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,440
so the the second type of tipping point

284
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,040
the right hand side

285
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,040
one is corresponding to multiple

286
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,640
equilibrium states in this case two

287
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,480
stable equilibria

288
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,839
that's why this arrow range here is

289
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,600
called bistability

290
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:56,800
two stable equilibria it is

291
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,959
coming with irreversibility so

292
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,199
basically if you march to the right here

293
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:04,319
on that upper stable branch

294
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,440
at that bifurcation point you fall off

295
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,560
down onto the lower stable branch but

296
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,800
you can't just go

297
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,638
back up from there you have to go all

298
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,439
the way to the left to that second

299
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,880
lower blue point there until you can go

300
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:22,240
back onto that stable branch

301
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,320
the second type is actually as an

302
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,519
everyday system that behaves like that

303
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,120
it can be easily compared to a kayak

304
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,600
if you're sitting in a kayak and you

305
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,120
lean a little bit to one side

306
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,279
then you experience a counter force so

307
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,560
the kayak is trying to upright itself

308
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,439
it's resisting

309
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,079
you tipping it but if you move further

310
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,920
and further and further

311
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,160
eventually you will reach a tipping

312
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,719
point this is the point

313
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,240
where the kayak stops resisting your

314
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,399
further leaning over

315
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,040
and instead it starts tipping over

316
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,120
further by itself

317
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,680
and then it flips right over until it's

318
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,880
upside down and you're falling out

319
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,359
so i have i have done this quite a few

320
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,439
times

321
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,959
i have a kayak that is quite narrow

322
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,800
where it

323
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,399
easily happens if you don't take care

324
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,839
that you flip over

325
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,200
now this kayak also has a range of

326
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,120
bi-stability so

327
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,720
once it's flipped over it's also in a

328
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,720
stable state

329
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,320
and it takes considerable effort to

330
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,240
turning upright again

331
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,519
into the other stable state when it's

332
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,519
vertical

333
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,519
upright rather than upside down

334
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,680
now the whole point is that systems like

335
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,079
this

336
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,079
exist also in the climate system

337
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:47,199
the kind of first type on the left hand

338
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:50,000
side corresponds for example to sea ice

339
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,120
and on the right hand side this type of

340
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,880
tipping element

341
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,600
compares to refers to the green and ice

342
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,320
sheets or

343
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:03,600
continental ice sheets also antarctica

344
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:06,320
or the atlantic ocean circulation

345
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,440
in terms of the transient behavior that

346
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,920
means if you

347
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,160
if you kind of go through a global

348
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,399
warming phase you're moving from left to

349
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,800
right in these diagrams

350
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,320
then in that sense they don't differ

351
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,439
very much

352
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,440
because in either case you follow a line

353
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,279
like this green line

354
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,040
so on the left hand side the green line

355
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,320
more or less follows more or less

356
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,120
closely

357
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,880
the red equilibrium line with a certain

358
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,279
delay depending on how

359
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,279
sluggish the system responds so that's

360
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,240
why the green arrows are not exactly on

361
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,079
top

362
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,880
of the red line here and

363
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,319
in the right hand side case you have a

364
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,360
similar thing

365
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,079
you're kind of in theory in equilibrium

366
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,720
you'd fall

367
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,319
off the cliff at this bifurcation point

368
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,320
but in praxis

369
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,120
the system has some inertia it takes

370
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,519
some time so if you gradually move

371
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,600
on the right towards the right there you

372
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,720
will also follow a green line which is

373
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,680
very similar

374
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,519
to the one in the left so in practical

375
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,880
terms if you're not trying to go back

376
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,519
but you're just going

377
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,160
forward progressive global warming the

378
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,240
difference

379
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,600
isn't all that big and the main

380
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,839
difference comes

381
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,800
from the intrinsic time scale of the

382
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,760
system

383
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,719
obviously cis can respond much more

384
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,800
quickly

385
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,959
to being just a few meters thick

386
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,680
compared to continental ice sheets like

387
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,199
greenland

388
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:38,839
ice which is about 3000 meters thick

389
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,399
and that just takes a very long time to

390
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,199
melt

391
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,560
now here's an overview of different

392
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,920
tipping elements

393
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,920
in the climate system

394
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,638
a few examples you can see starting on

395
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,959
the left here the boreal forest that are

396
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,880
the kind of northern forests

397
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:06,719
which typically like ecosystems do have

398
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:10,079
a tipping point a point of collapse

399
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,880
the whole idea of these um

400
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,638
tipping points and and system collapse

401
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,399
is very strongly linked actually to

402
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,880
ecosystem research

403
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,480
and the boreal forest they have a point

404
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,839
where they get too dry

405
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,480
that fires and pests are weakening the

406
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,480
forest so much that in a hot summer like

407
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,160
last year in siberia they go up in

408
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,440
flames lit by lightning

409
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:39,360
or the amazon rainforest this is also a

410
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:43,519
tipping element has been shown in many

411
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:46,160
vegetation dynamics models

412
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,759
which is partly linked to the fact that

413
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,120
such a forest

414
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,920
generates its own rain to an extent

415
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,480
by storing water in the soil keeping it

416
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,759
there and then bringing it up again

417
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,000
through evapotranspiration as we call it

418
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,519
the tree brings up water to the leaves

419
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,919
from where it then

420
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,359
enters the atmosphere again and then it

421
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,319
moves with the winds and

422
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,799
maybe 50 100 kilometers downwind it

423
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,879
falls

424
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,160
again as rain so it's a kind of

425
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,360
perpetual

426
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,360
rain recycling system which keeps

427
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:22,639
the whole forest nice and moist but if

428
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:26,319
you uh stress that too far

429
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,880
and reduce the first of all you cut down

430
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:32,000
force you make it smaller and also

431
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,880
you make it more drought prone

432
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,120
by warming up the climate which leads to

433
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,960
faster loss of moisture etc

434
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,439
greater moisture requirements by the

435
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,360
trees then you can stress it

436
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,760
up to the point where it gets so dry

437
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:49,280
that even the amazon rainforest

438
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,280
can go up in flames

439
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,720
another example if you see the top right

440
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,600
is the permafrost

441
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,120
thawing this is when it gets too warm

442
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,120
there is a very simple

443
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,719
threshold namely the freezing point of

444
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,159
course that is a tipping point

445
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,600
in a sense a freezing point of water

446
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:12,840
when the permafrost thaws then

447
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,280
there is methane gas escaping to the

448
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,360
atmosphere which then

449
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:22,160
also can enhance the further warming

450
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,760
which then leads to more permafrost

451
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,880
throwing and so on

452
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:30,160
typically these tipping points are

453
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,799
associated with such amplifying

454
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,799
feedbacks

455
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,639
i will discuss three of these in a

456
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,840
little bit more detail

457
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,039
the greenland ice sheet which

458
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:46,639
is undergoing accelerated ice loss

459
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:50,000
the atlantic overturning circulation or

460
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:53,280
often called gulf stream system and the

461
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,200
third one is a coral reefs

462
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,879
which are suffering from large-scale

463
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,520
die-off which also

464
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,640
as a typical ecosystem a response have a

465
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,639
critical threshold

466
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,919
these examples are discussed in our

467
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,760
paper climate tipping points too risky

468
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,720
to bet against which we published in

469
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,280
nature about one year ago

470
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,480
and they are also some of these tipping

471
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,080
points

472
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,160
interact they're interlinked and

473
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,080
one of our quotes there is that the

474
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,880
clearest emergency would be

475
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,320
if we were approaching a global cascade

476
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,799
of tipping points

477
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,520
that is a situation where one tipping

478
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:36,400
element is triggering the next one

479
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,840
in a kind of domino effect this is what

480
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,840
we fear most

481
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,960
now let's have a look at the green and

482
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,239
ice sheet this is another

483
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,480
video showing based on gray satellite

484
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,640
data where the ice sheet is losing mass

485
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,679
you can see in increasing blue colors

486
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,799
here

487
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,840
that the green and ice sheet is indeed

488
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,480
losing mass you can look up at the

489
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,280
nasa vital signs website which is very

490
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,559
good

491
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,639
indicators of various vital signs of our

492
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:14,000
planet including the data on

493
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,000
greenland ice loss constantly updated

494
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,280
now the point with the greenland ice

495
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,080
sheet is that it does have

496
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,000
a stability diagram like the schematic

497
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,120
one that i showed you earlier

498
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,400
with the bi-stable range and this is

499
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,959
shown

500
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,679
i think it was shown for the first time

501
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,200
by

502
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,799
my colleagues karloff and ganopolski in

503
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,440
2005

504
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:41,200
in this article where they used a

505
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,320
three-dimensional ice sheet model

506
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,240
coupled inside

507
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,240
a global climate model with ocean

508
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,559
atmosphere and so on

509
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,840
and on the x-axis there's basically

510
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,639
increasing

511
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,280
amount of heating going on in this case

512
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,480
because they were interested in the

513
00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:00,158
paleoclimate question

514
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:03,520
it is this uh driving force by the

515
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:06,000
orbital cycle the milankovitch cycles

516
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,000
you don't need to understand the numbers

517
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,080
but on the vertical axis you see the

518
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,360
response of the ice sheet the size of

519
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,559
the ice sheet

520
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,120
in million cubic kilometers and you can

521
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,840
see that

522
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,959
upper branch in the blue line we're

523
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:24,000
actually moving towards the right here

524
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,520
in this model simulation experiment and

525
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
you can see you stay on that upper

526
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,720
branch

527
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,240
until you reach this value on the x-axis

528
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,840
of around about 500

529
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:37,919
and this is where the tipping point is

530
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:40,720
there the ice mass declines melts away

531
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:44,240
away very quickly and you then end up at

532
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,480
that lower branch with no iso greenland

533
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,280
and they played this game they ran this

534
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,799
simulation out to more than 550 watts

535
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,039
per square meter

536
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,960
and the light blue line is what happens

537
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,000
when they return you know when they turn

538
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,120
down the heat again you lose you move

539
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,919
towards the left on this diagram but you

540
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,399
don't go back

541
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,120
up the same way as a dark blue line you

542
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,559
have to go

543
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,559
to much lower radiation values until

544
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,120
the ice sheet starts to grow again and

545
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,280
comes back

546
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,399
the dots by the way are points where

547
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,720
this has to

548
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,120
has been run for many thousands of years

549
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,520
really into an equilibrium

550
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,559
just to show that there are really for

551
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,520
the same

552
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,520
value on the x-axis two very different

553
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,200
equilibrium states

554
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:36,639
with and without green and ice sheet and

555
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,480
the fact that we now and in the holocene

556
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,240
in the last 10 000 years

557
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,000
have a greenland ice sheet and it

558
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,960
actually is stable

559
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,200
in the holocene climate is only because

560
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,960
of the initial condition because we came

561
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,799
out of an ice age

562
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,640
if you took away the greenland ice sheet

563
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,559
now then

564
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,480
in the current climate or the holocene

565
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,158
or pre-industrial climate it would never

566
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,880
grow back

567
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,880
what is the positive feedback there with

568
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,559
positive we don't mean that it's good

569
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,679
it's actually quite bad a positive

570
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,960
feedback

571
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,280
we mean an amplifying feedback and the

572
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,679
key

573
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,960
amplifying feedback here is what is

574
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:17,520
called the ice elevation feedback

575
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,520
the greenland ice sheet does not melt

576
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,320
because it's very cold at the surface

577
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,280
mostly below freezing

578
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,280
and why is it so cold because it is very

579
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,760
high up in the atmosphere this ice sheet

580
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,158
is 3000 meters thick after all

581
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,879
so it's like in a high mountain area

582
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,039
where it is quite cold

583
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,960
if you took away that ice sheet though

584
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,240
the surface then would be down at sea

585
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,799
level

586
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,919
uh or even below if you did this quickly

587
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,000
because the

588
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,440
bedrock is depressed but the surface

589
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,840
would come up to

590
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,559
sea level but down there it's much

591
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,559
warmer than

592
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,840
up at 3 000 meters altitude in the

593
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,799
atmosphere and

594
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,240
there it is actually too warm to keep

595
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,720
any snow on the ground

596
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,600
year round which would be required to

597
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,840
regrow

598
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,760
a new greenland ice sheet and that's why

599
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,480
you'd have to go back to a much colder

600
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,879
climate

601
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,679
than the holocene to get the green and

602
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,760
ice sheet back once it were lost

603
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,120
this is a typical example of this

604
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,000
amplifying feedback which leads to a

605
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,080
self-stabilizing system

606
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,200
it can either self-stabilize in the

607
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,600
upper branch here

608
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,760
when you start there or it self

609
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,399
stabilizes in the lower branch with no

610
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,960
ice when you start there this is what

611
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,360
makes it

612
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:36,240
a bi-stable system

613
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,320
to summarize the greenland ice sheet is

614
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,760
melting as another data the grey

615
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,200
satellites show but also

616
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,600
other data sets it has a tipping point

617
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,200
due to the ice elevation

618
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,799
now what i haven't shown but it's come

619
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,279
out in study

620
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,158
with many climate model simulation

621
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,200
experiments

622
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:58,480
going through more than

623
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,480
200 000 years of simulation from the

624
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,240
past through the eemian interglacial

625
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,960
period where we know how much

626
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,440
the ice sheets shrank back and we could

627
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,080
use those data from the past behavior of

628
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,440
greenland to calibrate the model

629
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,840
and so we know the

630
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,440
tipping point for the complete loss of

631
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,439
the greenland ice sheet is somewhere

632
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,880
between one degree and three degree

633
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,360
global warming

634
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,520
we're already at 1.2 degrees global

635
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,719
warming so we have started to enter the

636
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,600
danger zone

637
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,640
where we cross that tipping point it

638
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,439
doesn't mean

639
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,279
that it suddenly starts to melt very

640
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,240
fast or so because it has its own

641
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,720
intrinsic slow response time but what

642
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,799
that

643
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,360
crossing that tipping point means is

644
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,120
that even without further warming the

645
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,840
greenland ice sheet is doomed

646
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,039
it will continue to melt until it's gone

647
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,799
and this will lead

648
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:56,240
to seven meters of global sea level rise

649
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:59,840
drowning most of our big coastal cities

650
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,840
and many island nations

651
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,960
here is a look at the future from model

652
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:09,840
simulations from

653
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,600
ashwanden from nasa and you can see

654
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,120
nice view of what the surface looks like

655
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,959
and here's what the what it looks like

656
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,000
in the ice sheet model you can see the

657
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,120
eyes flowing

658
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,840
you can see it retreating so in purple

659
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,039
that's

660
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,559
bedrock that is exposed where the ice

661
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,679
sheet has withdrawn

662
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,559
in this simulation and so this as much

663
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,120
as ice

664
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,559
of ice that you would lose in the coming

665
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,959
300 years a

666
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:39,760
substantial fraction of the greenland

667
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:43,039
ice sheet

668
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,640
now let's look at another kind of

669
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,799
tipping element and that is the

670
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,840
gulfstream system or the north atlantic

671
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,000
current and i

672
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,279
i can't really introduce this topic as

673
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,440
one of my

674
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,760
favorite topics which i have studied

675
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,120
since the early 90s

676
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,760
without showing a clip from the famous

677
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,760
hollywood blockbuster the day after

678
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,559
tomorrow

679
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,840
what about the north atlantic current

680
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,520
what about it

681
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,199
the current depends upon a delicate

682
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,559
balance of salt and fresh water

683
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,640
we all know that yes but no one has

684
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,320
taken into account how much fresh water

685
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,799
has been dumped into the ocean because

686
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,039
of melting polar ice

687
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,360
i think we've hit a critical

688
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:25,360
desalinization point

689
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:35,120
yeah now that statement about

690
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,960
the critical desalination point is a

691
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,879
completely correct description of the

692
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,520
bifurcation point of the atlantic

693
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,039
circulation i'll show it in a minute

694
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,679
and the the statement that

695
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,080
nobody has taken into account the melt

696
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,279
water

697
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,039
from the greenland ice sheet is also was

698
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,360
completely correct when the movie

699
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,360
appeared in 2004

700
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,959
until then the typical climate

701
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,000
simulations that you could see

702
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,799
in the ipcc reports actually

703
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,240
until quite a few years later still had

704
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,039
not taken account

705
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,440
greenland melt water because basically

706
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:14,080
at that point in time the models

707
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,559
almost all climate models were just

708
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,039
ocean

709
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,918
atmosphere models plus land surface but

710
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,919
they didn't have

711
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,360
continental ice sheet models coupled

712
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,720
into them

713
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:27,360
and so in the meantime of course

714
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,240
we have better models that include

715
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,399
experiments

716
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,600
either with artificially added green

717
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,559
melt water from

718
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,158
data estimates or fully coupled with ice

719
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,039
sheet models

720
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,520
and from that an example here being that

721
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,158
nature

722
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,279
article by klaus burning and colleagues

723
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,880
we know

724
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:49,440
that the melt water input from greenland

725
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,799
has a non-negligible effect on the north

726
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,559
atlantic overturning

727
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,000
it's probably not the dominant effect

728
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,200
but it

729
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,960
adds to various factors that weaken

730
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,600
this north atlantic current and we also

731
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,080
know

732
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,360
that this system has a well-defined

733
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,080
tipping point

734
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,799
actually i described it in a nature

735
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,720
article

736
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:15,918
in 1996

737
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:19,279
due to assault transport feedback

738
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,000
the basic idea behind that has actually

739
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,919
been known

740
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,240
since the late 1950s or early 60s

741
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,399
since work by the famous american

742
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,399
oceanographer henry stommer

743
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:33,520
but what i showed in my nature article

744
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:36,158
in 96 is that it actually works that way

745
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,918
in a complex three-dimensional global

746
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:42,159
ocean circulation model

747
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:44,080
not just in very simplified models

748
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,840
and since then this has been shown for a

749
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,639
whole range of different

750
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,639
climate models

751
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,639
the salt transportation feedback is also

752
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,640
one of these

753
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,399
amplifying feedbacks and it's easy to

754
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,200
explain

755
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,840
the overturning circulation of the

756
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,080
atlantic

757
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,000
is called overturning because it's

758
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,520
really a vertical overturning

759
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
where water sinks down from the surface

760
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:13,200
to great depth of two to three

761
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,240
kilometers in the atlantic

762
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,120
because this water is heavy and it

763
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,679
spreads then

764
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,000
in the deep ocean until it rises up in

765
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,880
other parts mainly around antarctica

766
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,880
in in the

767
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,399
circum antarctic circumpolar current

768
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,559
area

769
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,760
and comes back at the surface so

770
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,559
basically the whole

771
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,640
ocean is overturned with deep water

772
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:40,000
being renewed and

773
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:43,039
then coming back to the surface

774
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,279
on very long time scale of

775
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:50,080
about a thousand to two thousand years

776
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:52,960
for complete overturning there

777
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,720
now the whole system is driven by the

778
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,399
fact that

779
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,799
the water sinks down where it has

780
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,239
the highest density and that's in the

781
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,240
northern atlantic

782
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,559
and around antarctica around the

783
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,679
antarctic continent

784
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,519
and it has the highest density there not

785
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,320
only because it's very cold but

786
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,159
also quite salty this is why you don't

787
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,279
have deep water formation in the north

788
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,279
pacific

789
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,679
in the northern hemisphere you only have

790
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:24,240
that in the north atlantic

791
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,880
and that's because the north atlantic

792
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,000
waters

793
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,640
are quite salty and this is because

794
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,679
this north atlantic current exists and

795
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,000
brings

796
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,440
salty water from the subtropics up to

797
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,279
the high latitudes

798
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,519
where normally it isn't very salty

799
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,559
because it gets diluted by excess

800
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,559
rainfall

801
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:45,918
whereas the subtropics have excess

802
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,960
evaporation and that's why they're salty

803
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,840
and so

804
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,080
it's like a chicken and an egg situation

805
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,399
the northern atlantic is salty because

806
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,760
you have this overturning circulation

807
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,559
and you have this overturning

808
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,799
circulation because it's salty there

809
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,559
and so you can see the self-amplifying

810
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,039
feedback there again

811
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,080
which means it is a self-stabilizing

812
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,240
system

813
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,600
up to a certain breaking point a tipping

814
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,000
point

815
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,039
which can be reached if you add too much

816
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,559
fresh water

817
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:19,840
diluting the northern atlantic

818
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,158
and the stability diagram again looks

819
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,320
like

820
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,840
that second one you've seen that for the

821
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,960
greenland ice sheet

822
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,120
and as i said this has been verified in

823
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,399
detailed model simulations with many

824
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,000
different models

825
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,439
that it really works like that in a

826
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,640
complex 3d

827
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,799
situation where you have depending on

828
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,559
how much fresh water you add

829
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,660
into the northern atlantic this is the

830
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,760
control parameter here

831
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,760
[Music]

832
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,760
you can move along that upper stable

833
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,960
branch with the overturning to

834
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:54,080
circulation until that

835
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,320
stomal bifurcation point and there

836
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,879
this overturning breaks down and you

837
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,320
fall down onto that lower branch

838
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,720
without this overturning it's labeled

839
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,240
here

840
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,760
nadw flow that nadw stands for north

841
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,840
atlantic deep water

842
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,360
it's uh yeah i would say one of the

843
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,240
favorite water masses of the

844
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,240
oceanographers

845
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,399
now let's look at the gulf stream the

846
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:25,200
surface circulation

847
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:27,518
in a climate model this is the cm 2.6

848
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,679
global coupled climate model ocean

849
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,840
atmosphere by the geophysical fluid

850
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,960
dynamics laboratory in princeton

851
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,840
you can beautifully see the gulf stream

852
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,799
in dark red here because it's warm

853
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,399
leaving the coast of the united states

854
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,559
at cape hatteras there

855
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,320
starting to meander breaking up into

856
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,559
these eddies etc

857
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,760
and it actually means the co meets the

858
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,879
cold waters

859
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:56,080
coming down inshore from the north

860
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,840
which are shown in blue here and so this

861
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,840
is what this

862
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,959
the surface part of the circulation

863
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,799
looks in

864
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:07,519
a global climate model and

865
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:10,159
if you add carbon dioxide to that

866
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:13,280
climate model's atmosphere

867
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,800
the climate warms of course but it does

868
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,119
show a peculiar

869
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,000
pattern of sea surface temperature

870
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,560
change which you see here

871
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,599
and this actually shows the sea surface

872
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,440
temperature change

873
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,200
relative to the global mean so

874
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,119
everything that is blue has

875
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,279
either warmed less than the global

876
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,679
average or even cooled which is

877
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,639
actually the case south of greenland and

878
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,839
everything that is

879
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,679
orangey or red has warmed

880
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,719
substantially more than the global

881
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:45,200
average sea surface

882
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,040
and you see a very strong pattern in the

883
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:50,879
northern atlantic

884
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,639
with this big cold blob the blue blob

885
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,359
south of greenland

886
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,560
and a very warm region inshore of the

887
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,920
gulf stream

888
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:02,480
along the coast of north america

889
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,720
and in the climate model of course we

890
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,119
are a bit like gods in that sense

891
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,040
that we have complete information about

892
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,040
what's going on there

893
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,960
if we store all the data at every grid

894
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,400
point we know exactly everything that's

895
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,200
happening and we can

896
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,760
analyze the reasons and the reason for

897
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,799
this

898
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,920
funny pattern in the northern atlantic

899
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:28,320
actually is a slowdown of the

900
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,320
north atlantic overturning circulation

901
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:36,240
that means that less heat is transported

902
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,520
to the subpolar ocean south of green and

903
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,200
there that blue area

904
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,599
which makes it cool down and

905
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,040
the gulf stream proper at the surface

906
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,359
moves inshore

907
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,440
there is complicated dynamical reasons

908
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,759
for that but there is

909
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,880
already long before this was shown in

910
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,760
this model

911
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,280
a theoretical underpinning for this it

912
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,000
has to do with

913
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,040
the vorticity dynamics on a rotating

914
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,680
sphere

915
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,079
too technical to go into in such a talk

916
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,319
but it's a well understood phenomenon

917
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,240
and so we know that this slowdown of the

918
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,000
gulf stream system

919
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,680
is the reason behind this peculiar

920
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,920
temperature pattern

921
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,520
and this pattern is predicted by this

922
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,119
climate model

923
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,520
for a global warming situation and uh

924
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,440
my phd student lifeguard cesar who was

925
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,440
the first author on this nature paper

926
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,800
from 2018

927
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,200
she looked at all the available

928
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,680
measurements of sea surface temperatures

929
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,160
since the beginning of the 20th century

930
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,799
and of course because we have only

931
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,640
limited

932
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,800
ocean temperature measurements we have

933
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,040
only a fuzzy picture here not a sharp

934
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,079
one like in the climate model

935
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,560
but you can see a similar pattern in the

936
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,200
north atlantic in the observations

937
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,040
compared to what the model predicts in

938
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,799
response to a slowdown of the

939
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,520
overturning circulation

940
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,040
and our conclusion here is that we are

941
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,920
actually observing this

942
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,400
slowdown of the circulation why do we

943
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,040
take

944
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,160
indirect evidence for this like this

945
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,599
because we don't

946
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,799
of course have measurements going back

947
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,960
100 years or more about the strength of

948
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,280
that overturning circulation

949
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,000
we have actually only started to measure

950
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,119
this

951
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,839
regularly in 2004 with a so-called rapid

952
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,040
array

953
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:30,640
at 26 degrees north in the atlantic

954
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:33,040
and what we reconstructed about the

955
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,040
evolution of this current

956
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,520
for the last period where we do have the

957
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:43,520
direct measurements agrees well

958
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:45,759
with what the direct measurements show

959
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,040
we concluded that the overturning

960
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,400
circulation has

961
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,119
declined since at least the mid 20th

962
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,359
century

963
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:57,680
by about 15 so far

964
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:59,440
there are of course other indirect types

965
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,680
of measurements

966
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,079
you can use sediment data of various

967
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,078
kinds and with various methodologies to

968
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,680
reconstruct the strength of this

969
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,680
atlantic overturning

970
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,480
and a number of different studies are

971
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,319
compiled here in this diagram

972
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,720
and even though of course they they

973
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,280
differ somewhat in the detail

974
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,000
they all tend to agree in this overall

975
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,000
picture

976
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,640
that the atlantic overturning

977
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,440
circulation has been quite stable

978
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,078
for the previous thousand years or so

979
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,280
before the

980
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,680
20th century but and then in the 20th

981
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,960
century has showed a clear

982
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,200
declining signature and

983
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,480
one example of the media coverage of

984
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,520
this is that

985
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,160
washington post article here which if

986
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,560
you can see the small print of the most

987
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,640
read

988
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,000
articles there on that day actually made

989
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,040
it to number three

990
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,200
or the most red washington post articles

991
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,119
there is definitely an interest in

992
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:02,399
science and climate change

993
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:02,400
science by the readers in the newspapers

994
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,759
so far we've talked about a slowdown and

995
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,760
not so much about

996
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,760
where this tipping point is one reason

997
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,240
is we don't know really we know there is

998
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,000
a tipping point that is a robust result

999
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,799
of many different studies and model

1000
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,440
experiments

1001
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,359
and theory but we don't know how far

1002
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,280
away we are from this

1003
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,880
that is very typical for these tipping

1004
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,000
points because they involve

1005
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,480
highly non-linear dynamics that means

1006
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,079
they can depend very sensitively on the

1007
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,079
exact conditions

1008
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,040
for example in this case the exact

1009
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:43,119
salinity distribution in the atlantic

1010
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:45,119
and the exact circulation pattern and

1011
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,119
models get these things kind of

1012
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,000
approximately right but not exactly

1013
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:52,400
right and if you have a

1014
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,599
situation where the question of where

1015
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,520
the tipping point is

1016
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,040
is very sensitive to the exact

1017
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,720
conditions then you have a large

1018
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,160
uncertainty about where the tipping

1019
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,279
point is

1020
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,720
and so there is discussion in the

1021
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,800
literature i just

1022
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,839
point out to one study here in science

1023
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,400
advances that

1024
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:14,400
try to correct for the

1025
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:18,000
inaccuracies in how we can reproduce

1026
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,319
the salinity in the atlantic waters

1027
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,400
and found that if you correct for that

1028
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,520
the circulation is actually a lot more

1029
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,119
sensitive

1030
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,319
than in other models and maybe that

1031
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,000
model is more correct

1032
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:32,240
of course it has other weaknesses as

1033
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
well we don't know which of the models

1034
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,118
is correct but should we cross this

1035
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,839
tipping point

1036
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,760
then the north atlantic circulation

1037
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,359
system would break down

1038
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,960
and you get a temperature pattern like

1039
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,040
the one shown here

1040
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,200
the cold blob in the atlantic that is

1041
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,720
now only over the ocean it exists

1042
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,879
right it's the only part of the world

1043
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,240
that has cooled since the beginning of

1044
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,119
the 20th century

1045
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,040
but it hasn't affected any land areas

1046
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,480
but if the circulation would break down

1047
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,720
altogether and not only weaken by 15

1048
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,400
this cold would expand greatly and

1049
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,759
affect great britain

1050
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,599
scandinavia iceland as you can see here

1051
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,760
which would then get a much colder

1052
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:16,800
climate whereas the rest of the globe

1053
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,880
continues to have a warmer climate

1054
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,359
this is really distinct from an ice age

1055
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,040
and so this is also really distinct from

1056
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,520
that hollywood movie the day after

1057
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:28,800
tomorrow where the earth goes into a

1058
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:31,359
huge ice age instant freeze that of

1059
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,280
course is totally unrealistic and the

1060
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:36,160
the screenwriter and the director they

1061
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,720
knew this they actually told me

1062
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,279
that if they were in the business of

1063
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,399
making

1064
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,480
a movie for a few million viewers they

1065
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,319
would stick to the laws of physics

1066
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,000
but since they make movies for a few

1067
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,720
hundred million viewers they stick to

1068
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,880
the laws of hollywood drama

1069
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,040
but you would get a substantial regional

1070
00:41:52,880 --> 00:42:00,240
cooling with major impacts

1071
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,240
on ecosystems on human society

1072
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,400
now let me come to the third type of

1073
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,119
tipping point that i want to discuss

1074
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,240
today

1075
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,079
this is the coral reefs coral reefs like

1076
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,000
many ecosystems do have critical

1077
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:15,119
thresholds

1078
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,760
coral reefs are very important even

1079
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,800
though they only cover a very small

1080
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,839
percentage of the earth's surface

1081
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,960
they support a quarter of oil marine

1082
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:28,640
life

1083
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,280
40 coral cover of the world has already

1084
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,960
been lost 100 countries

1085
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:38,079
depend quite substantially on corals

1086
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,520
there's a 800 billion total global asset

1087
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:43,599
of coral reefs so

1088
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,599
it does have a major impact on people

1089
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,598
now corals when they are about to die

1090
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,119
they bleach

1091
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:54,640
they are abandoned by their algae

1092
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:57,359
that provides them with nutrition

1093
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,879
and that's why they lose their color and

1094
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:02,480
then after a while

1095
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:06,720
they they die they get covered

1096
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:09,359
by other by seaweed non-symbiotic alkyl

1097
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,359
and they die

1098
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,040
and they do have a temperature threshold

1099
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,880
there's a critical

1100
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,319
warming threshold where this bleaching

1101
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,200
happens

1102
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:20,759
but an additional factor not yet the

1103
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,839
most important factor is the

1104
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:26,720
acidification of water it's a direct

1105
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:28,560
chemical effect of adding carbon dioxide

1106
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,839
to the atmosphere

1107
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:34,640
which then goes partly into the oceans

1108
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:36,880
and acidifies the ocean waters but the

1109
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:40,400
main effect until now is

1110
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,720
the marine heat waves which cross

1111
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,520
more and more frequently the temperature

1112
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,598
tolerance

1113
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,640
threshold of coral reefs and here you

1114
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:51,599
can see that for the great barrier reef

1115
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:54,879
a huge fantastic world wonder that you

1116
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:58,440
can see from space and you can see here

1117
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,160
the bleaching in the years 2016 2017 and

1118
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,440
2020

1119
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:06,879
three major bleaching events which

1120
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:09,040
affected uh in each case the red area

1121
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,240
here with the most severe bleaching

1122
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,440
you can see that by now large is a very

1123
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,759
large part of the

1124
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,599
great barrier reef has bleached in these

1125
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,640
three events

1126
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:22,160
it's very tragic and you can see here

1127
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,759
for example the march

1128
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,598
the 2016 bleaching event in march the

1129
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,560
coral was bleached

1130
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:33,040
by may it was already overgrown by

1131
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,720
seaweed

1132
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:39,119
and just in 2015 and 2016

1133
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,040
we actually had worldwide coral reef

1134
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,280
bleaching not only at the great barrier

1135
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,520
reef in australia

1136
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,040
only the blue ones out of these hundred

1137
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,319
reefs that were observed

1138
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,880
in this study only the blue ones escaped

1139
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,880
bleaching

1140
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:57,520
so we are actually in the midst of a

1141
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,640
great

1142
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:03,520
worldwide coral die-off

1143
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,078
event which is another prediction of

1144
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,440
climate

1145
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:10,640
science coming true if you look at the

1146
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,240
latest ipcc report it states that with 2

1147
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,799
degrees warming virtually

1148
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,118
all coral reefs will be lost more than

1149
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,680
99

1150
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,800
1.5 degree warming if we manage to limit

1151
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:27,118
the warming to 1.5 degrees we can save

1152
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:32,319
between 10 and 30 percent of the corals

1153
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:35,359
that is really depressing

1154
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:38,880
now let me talk briefly about what

1155
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:40,400
can we do a major success is of course

1156
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,480
the paris accord

1157
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,119
the biggest failure of which is that it

1158
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,480
hasn't come 20 years earlier

1159
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,640
after all the world community already in

1160
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,960
1992

1161
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,359
decided to stop global warming at the

1162
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,160
rio earth summit

1163
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:57,839
the nation signed the united nations

1164
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,118
framework convention

1165
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:03,759
on climate change and it took a full

1166
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,400
25 years of further negotiations to

1167
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,599
finally

1168
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:12,079
reach the paris accord

1169
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:14,319
now you can see

1170
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,079
here that the goal of this is to hold

1171
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:17,279
the increase in the global average

1172
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,280
temperature

1173
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,640
to well below 2 degrees above

1174
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,880
pre-industrial level

1175
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,359
so it's not 2 degrees it's well below 2

1176
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,040
degrees that's very important point

1177
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:29,040
many countries would not have signed up

1178
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,680
if it simply had said two degrees which

1179
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:36,319
was an older goal

1180
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:38,640
but it has shown to be insufficient

1181
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,640
and

1182
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:46,000
um and to sorry and to pursue

1183
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,000
efforts to limit the temperature

1184
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,640
increase to 1.5

1185
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,880
degrees above pre-industrial level so

1186
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,440
that is a more stringent

1187
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,760
paris goal but at least the nations have

1188
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,520
committed to pursue efforts so

1189
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,200
my view is that every person should ask

1190
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,920
their own government

1191
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,000
what you are doing here is this a

1192
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,280
credible effort to try and limit

1193
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,079
warming to 1.5 degrees we might not make

1194
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,240
it

1195
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,839
but at least we should try to limit the

1196
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,399
warming to 1.5

1197
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:20,319
to avoid the risk of destabilization of

1198
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,880
the greenland ice sheet

1199
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:25,759
almost complete coral die off and many

1200
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,160
further risks

1201
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,480
so what does this entail that is an

1202
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,200
important point

1203
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,599
if you want to limit global warming to

1204
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,640
some value whatever it is 1.5

1205
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:41,119
2 3 whatever you choose

1206
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,759
it means you can only emit a limited

1207
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:46,079
amount of carbon dioxide

1208
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,119
that is because the amount of global

1209
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,800
warming

1210
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:54,480
is to good extent proportional

1211
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:56,800
to the total amount of co2 that we have

1212
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,319
ever emitted so to the cumulative

1213
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,880
emissions

1214
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:03,200
it's like filling a bathtub with water

1215
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,079
if you want to draw the line at any

1216
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,520
level and say no further than here you

1217
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,720
can only add a limited

1218
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:12,000
amount of water and if you want to limit

1219
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,558
global warming

1220
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,160
to some value you can only add a limited

1221
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:20,480
amount of co2 to the atmosphere

1222
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,240
and this is shown here for two different

1223
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,720
uh examples two different

1224
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,279
amounts this is actually the numbers

1225
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:29,759
here

1226
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,079
are emissions from the year 2016. so

1227
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,200
it's

1228
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,240
uh don't take these numbers from now we

1229
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:39,040
have already

1230
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:39,040
had four more years of emissions

1231
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,920
the solid lines throw show three

1232
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:49,839
scenarios

1233
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,839
with 600 billion tons of co2

1234
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,359
and they all have the same amount of

1235
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,480
emission so they

1236
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:58,240
all three solid lines get the same

1237
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,160
amount of warming

1238
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,240
this is about actually these lines

1239
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:06,399
correspond to about a 50

1240
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:08,959
chance of ending up at 1.5 degrees

1241
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,119
and so they all get you the same amount

1242
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,319
of warming

1243
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:16,319
but with different

1244
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:19,359
times of when the peak emissions are

1245
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:22,800
reached so 2016 went past

1246
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:24,799
without us uh getting over the peak of

1247
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,040
the emissions 2020

1248
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,520
maybe we still have a chance emissions

1249
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,839
have dropped a bit in 2020 but

1250
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,960
not for structural change mostly but due

1251
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:35,599
to corona

1252
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:38,480
but we still we have a chance that maybe

1253
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:41,520
next year they are lower still

1254
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,480
and what this shows is that the longer

1255
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,359
you wait

1256
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,839
the steeper your reductions have to be

1257
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:50,319
not only because you're starting later

1258
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,359
but also because you have to reach zero

1259
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,359
earlier at the end

1260
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,960
notice how all these three lines the

1261
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:57,520
later you start

1262
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,160
with reducing the earlier you have to

1263
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,720
reach

1264
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,799
zero emissions because the surface area

1265
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,919
under these curves is what counts

1266
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,839
for the climate goal the dashed line is

1267
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:12,000
a more generous goal which would

1268
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:15,599
end us at about 1.75 degrees or so

1269
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,880
best estimate this is kind of the weaker

1270
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:21,280
periscope of well below 2 degrees

1271
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,119
which would allow us to gradually reduce

1272
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,880
emissions to 0

1273
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:29,520
by 2050. this is not counting in any

1274
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:33,280
negative emissions afterwards by the way

1275
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:35,359
this is the net emissions if you like so

1276
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,960
we have to reach net zero emissions in

1277
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:40,240
2050

1278
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,240
but of course if we wait five more years

1279
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,078
until emissions start to decline

1280
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,598
then they'll have to be at zero five

1281
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,160
years earlier so

1282
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,200
this is why it's so important to start

1283
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,839
now

1284
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,439
this by the way is from an article by

1285
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:57,599
christiana figueres at

1286
00:50:53,440 --> 00:51:01,280
al in nature published 2017

1287
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,280
where i was a co-author as well

1288
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,000
now final point can tipping points maybe

1289
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,078
help us

1290
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,520
and i'm talking here about societal

1291
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,760
tipping points and

1292
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,040
there are also some interesting studies

1293
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,000
on that

1294
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,359
the basic idea is that shown in the top

1295
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,160
right here

1296
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:22,960
we are in a kind of stable equilibrium

1297
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:26,078
where the red bull is now

1298
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:28,559
and we are stuck there it's hard to get

1299
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,960
out of this

1300
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,839
but there is a better equilibrium a more

1301
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,520
stable one

1302
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:35,599
further off to the right and the

1303
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:38,000
question is how do we get

1304
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,119
over the hill into that beneficial

1305
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,760
equilibrium

1306
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:42,960
of a sustainable global economy a

1307
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,839
sustainable

1308
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,240
energy system a stable climate and so on

1309
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:51,440
complete decarbonization

1310
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:54,000
that means no more fossil fuel use and

1311
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,680
this this green addition there that is

1312
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,720
added there is

1313
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:01,839
they're just some examples of how we can

1314
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:04,000
make this transition earlier easier

1315
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:05,119
and the hill that we have to get over

1316
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,680
smaller

1317
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,119
so we can make this current status quo

1318
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:12,399
that we're in a little bit

1319
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,280
less comfortable by putting a price on

1320
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,559
carbon

1321
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:20,240
we can make the transition easier by

1322
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:23,680
subsidizing renewable energies

1323
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:25,680
there are there is a greening of values

1324
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:28,558
there is a tipping point in

1325
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:30,558
thinking in society there are many

1326
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,880
co-benefits of this transformation

1327
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,160
in terms of avoided air pollution for

1328
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,960
example

1329
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,640
millions of people die every year from

1330
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,359
outdoor air pollution

1331
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,720
which would to a large extent go away if

1332
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:47,200
we stop fossil fuel

1333
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:50,399
use and we have seen a massive movement

1334
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,839
by the young people fridays for future

1335
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,400
here's greta tunberg

1336
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:56,400
talking to me at our institute she came

1337
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,480
last year to visit us here

1338
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,000
here is a friday's demonstration in

1339
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,559
berlin where i took this

1340
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,680
photo this is really changing the

1341
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,000
society's

1342
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,279
values and it's changing election

1343
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,720
results

1344
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:14,240
and it could be a tipping point towards

1345
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:17,598
a sustainable global society

1346
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:19,680
and with that hopeful message i want to

1347
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:22,000
end and i thank you very much for your

1348
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,919
attention if you want to read more

1349
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,960
there's a couple of books of mine that

1350
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:29,200
have also come out in english

1351
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,200
you can follow me on the blogs and of

1352
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,160
course in social media preferably at

1353
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,319
twitter

1354
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,160
i put also the scientists for future

1355
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:38,558
logo there because

1356
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,279
many thousands of scientists are engaged

1357
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:42,800
there

1358
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:45,280
to try and stop the climate crisis

1359
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,720
this is really a matter of survival of

1360
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,119
civilization

1361
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,279
thank you very much for listening you

1362
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,920
should stick to science and leave policy

1363
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,680
to us

1364
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,119
well we tried that approach you didn't

1365
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:58,319
want to hear about the science

1366
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,319
when it could have made a difference

1367
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,598
thank you so much shuffling for your

1368
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,000
talk now we have some questions from the

1369
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:08,640
internets

1370
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,480
see the first question is which

1371
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,520
additional tipping points will be

1372
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:16,880
triggered at

1373
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,880
2 degrees 3 degrees and so on

1374
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:21,760
that is actually a difficult question to

1375
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,680
answer

1376
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,520
because of the uncertainty that i

1377
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,558
mentioned in my talk about where these

1378
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,759
tipping points

1379
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,160
are there is

1380
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,839
one in antarctica the wilkes basin that

1381
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,440
is a part of the antarctic ice sheet

1382
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:38,640
that's that could be

1383
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,280
triggered say below three degrees there

1384
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,040
are

1385
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:44,240
others like the ocean circulation where

1386
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,480
you probably

1387
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,598
at least we hope you have to go beyond

1388
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,280
three degrees to

1389
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:50,960
really trigger a collapse of the gulf

1390
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,960
stream system

1391
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,960
but the truth is that there are very

1392
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:58,400
large uncertainty ranges

1393
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,880
and the main fact is that with every bit

1394
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,640
of

1395
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:06,400
extra warming we increase the risk of

1396
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:08,558
crossing more tipping points

1397
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,079
and are there some of these tipping

1398
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,880
points that are interrelated or

1399
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,000
correlated

1400
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,480
for instance could we save some tipping

1401
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,040
points

1402
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:20,000
if we are able to save others for

1403
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:22,960
instance the collapse of the gulf stream

1404
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,880
yes there are these interconnections for

1405
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,920
example if if the gulf stream system

1406
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,880
collapses

1407
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,000
it will affect the atmospheric

1408
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,200
circulation

1409
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,599
the monsoon systems then can shift the

1410
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:38,160
tropical rainfall belts this is not just

1411
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,799
theoretical we see that in paleoclimate

1412
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,558
where

1413
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:42,799
we have seen these collapses of the

1414
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:46,400
north atlantic circulation

1415
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:48,480
and the paleoclimatic proxy data show

1416
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,000
that it comes with shifts in the

1417
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:53,119
tropical rainfall belts

1418
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,280
that could then in this way trigger a

1419
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,280
major drought in the amazon region if

1420
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:00,480
the gulf stream system collapses

1421
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,799
and so it would be very wise to

1422
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,799
prevent these tipping points especially

1423
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:06,880
when it comes to the ocean circulation

1424
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:09,440
or atmospheric circulation

1425
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:13,599
because that's really going to mess up

1426
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,599
the the weather patterns in a major way

1427
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:20,400
how long have we known about

1428
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:20,400
human-caused climate change

1429
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:27,640
well in principle in the 19th century

1430
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:30,799
alexander von humboldt actually wrote in

1431
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:31,200
1843 if i remember correctly that humans

1432
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:34,480
are

1433
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:37,200
changing the climate by cutting down

1434
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,119
forests and emitting large amounts of

1435
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,960
gases at the centers of industry that's

1436
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,280
almost a little literal quote by

1437
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,280
alexander von humboldt

1438
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,319
we've known about how sensitive the

1439
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,200
climate is

1440
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:51,520
to a change in co2 since the swedish

1441
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,839
nobel laureate svante arrhenius

1442
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,960
remotely related to greater tune back by

1443
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:58,000
the way

1444
00:56:54,960 --> 00:57:01,200
in india studied the effect of

1445
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,760
a co2 doubling he wasn't worried by that

1446
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,839
because

1447
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,799
he thought global warming would be great

1448
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:06,799
you know bring it on

1449
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:13,760
let's just die no no it's

1450
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,280
um back can see my picture still yeah i

1451
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,720
don't know what happened there

1452
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:21,520
and so he suggested uh

1453
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,959
you know burning a lot of coal to

1454
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,119
enhance global warming

1455
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,880
i guess he came from sweden and thought

1456
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:29,280
cold is bad

1457
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,079
without thinking this through properly

1458
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,040
but the first

1459
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:35,200
real expert report warning the u.s

1460
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:37,920
government lyndon b johnson

1461
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,200
of the coming global warming due to

1462
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,480
fossil fuel use

1463
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:45,919
was a rebel report in 1965

1464
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:49,920
exactly 50 years half a century before

1465
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,920
finally the paris agreement was reached

1466
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,280
will you be publishing your slides from

1467
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:56,960
the talk

1468
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,960
yes i will uploading the slides

1469
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,839
what is or or what should be the

1470
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,720
ultimate goal of the climate change

1471
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:04,880
mitigation

1472
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:08,160
for instance is it saving lives saving

1473
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:10,400
other species

1474
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,520
well i think the the ultimate goal is of

1475
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,480
course

1476
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,200
preserving human civilization as we know

1477
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,359
it because

1478
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:22,520
i think if we let this run we will not

1479
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:26,078
only destroy a lot of ecosystems and

1480
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:29,759
biodiversity but we will probably cause

1481
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:32,480
major hunger crisis which you know with

1482
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,559
big droughts like the the one in syria

1483
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:38,240
before the unrest in syria

1484
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:40,000
started in 2011

1485
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,439
the country went through the biggest

1486
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,680
drought in history and

1487
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,160
according to sediment data from the

1488
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:49,598
eastern mediterranean it was the

1489
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:53,359
worst drought in at least 900 years

1490
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:56,480
and then you know i think especially

1491
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:56,880
in some unstable conflicted countries

1492
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,000
this

1493
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:02,960
can really turn them into failed states

1494
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,440
that is what happened in syria and it's

1495
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,920
what

1496
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,640
a german report for the german

1497
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,680
government

1498
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:12,078
actually warned in 2009

1499
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,919
um it was called climate change as a

1500
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,040
security risk i was actually one of the

1501
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,200
co-authors of that

1502
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:19,119
report because i was in the german

1503
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:21,040
government's advisory panel on global

1504
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:24,079
change at the time

1505
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:26,640
and i think we will see increasing

1506
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:28,319
hunger crisis failed states and all the

1507
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,359
effects that that has on

1508
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:35,599
international politics if we cannot

1509
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:35,598
keep global warming below two degrees

1510
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,558
and finally is there a specific call to

1511
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,400
action

1512
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:43,680
for the chaos community is there

1513
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:47,839
anything that we can do

1514
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,839
with our mindset and our skills

1515
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:54,480
that's a good question that i haven't

1516
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:56,879
thought about but maybe you can

1517
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,079
know yourself the best thing what you

1518
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,160
can do

1519
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:03,359
i think the key is really to keep up the

1520
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:06,799
pressure on the political world

1521
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:10,319
like fridays for future has been doing

1522
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:13,359
go on the streets protest vote

1523
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:14,960
with climate as a priority i think these

1524
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,680
