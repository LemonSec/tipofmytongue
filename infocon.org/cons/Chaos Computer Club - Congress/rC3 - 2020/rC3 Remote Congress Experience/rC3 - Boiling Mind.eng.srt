00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,800
now

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,439
imagine a stage with an artist

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,359
performing in front of a crowd

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,480
is there a way to measure and even

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,359
quantify

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,000
the show's impact on the spectators kai

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,920
kunta

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,480
is going to address this question in his

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,960
talk boiling minds now kai

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,960
up to you

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,640
thanks a lot for the introduction we

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,600
have a

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:45,840
short video i hope that can be played

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,840
right now

17
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:59,840

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,840
uh okay

34
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,600
oh okay yeah so thanks a lot for the

35
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,040
intro

36
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,960
and um this is uh no the boiling mind

37
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,320
talks or linking physiology and

38
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,479
choreography

39
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:31,280
and i just started off with this

40
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,280
short video that could give you an

41
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,638
overview over the

42
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,479
experience of this dance performance

43
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,960
that we staged in in tokyo

44
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,840
beginning of the year just before the

45
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,520
lockdown

46
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:51,679
actually and the idea behind this was

47
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:55,359
we wanted to put the audience on a stage

48
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,600
so breaking the fourth wall trying to

49
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,280
use physiological sensing in the

50
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,680
audience

51
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,719
and that then that changed and is

52
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,320
reflected

53
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:10,000
on stage over the projection sound

54
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,479
and also audio to influence the dancers

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,280
and performers and then of course feed

56
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,880
them back

57
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:21,119
again to the audience

58
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,520
so creating an augmented feedback loop

59
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,240
in this talk today i just want to give

60
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,960
you

61
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,199
a small overview a little bit about the

62
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:33,440
motivation why i thought it's a

63
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:36,720
nice topic for uh the remote experience

64
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,000
uh from the gears computer club and also

65
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,120
a little bit more about the

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,120
concept the setup and the design

67
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,160
iterations as well as the lessons

68
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,840
learned

69
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,360
so for for me to give this talk

70
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,560
um i thought it's a good exp it's a good

71
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,360
way to

72
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,280
exchange expertise i get a couple of

73
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,639
people that might be interested

74
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,960
for the next iterations because i think

75
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,680
uh we are still not done with this work

76
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,960
so it's still

77
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,919
kind of work in progress and also a way

78
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,318
to share data

79
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,560
so to do some explorative data analysis

80
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,199
on the recorded performances that we

81
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,319
have

82
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,000
and then most important i wanted to

83
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,039
create a more

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,800
creative way to use physiological data

85
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,318
and explore it because

86
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,520
also for me as a researcher working on

87
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,720
variable computing or

88
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,919
activity recognition often we just look

89
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,800
into

90
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,599
recognizing or predicting certain

91
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,039
motions

92
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,800
or certain mental states

93
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,520
and that kind of at least for

94
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,039
simple things feeds back into this you

95
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,479
know very

96
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:54,240
i think idiotic or stupid

97
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,680
ideas of surveillance and applications

98
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,199
cases in that so

99
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,759
can we create more intuitive ways to use

100
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,000
physio physiological data

101
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,880
so from a concept perspective i think

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,560
the video gave a good overview

103
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,680
or what we tried to create however

104
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,880
what we did in three performances was

105
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,280
we used physiological senses on

106
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,400
all audience members so for us it was

107
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,960
important that

108
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,799
we're not singling out individual people

109
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,880
to just get feedback from them

110
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,840
but have the whole response the whole

111
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,080
physiological state of the audience as

112
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,840
an

113
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:39,520
input to the performance

114
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,560
in that case we actually used heart rate

115
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,159
heart rate variability and also galvanic

116
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,599
skin response as

117
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,400
inputs and these inputs then

118
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,199
changed to projection that you could see

119
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,440
the lights

120
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,520
especially the intensity of the lights

121
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,280
and also the sound

122
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:04,080
and that again then led to changes in

123
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,080
the dancing behavior of the performers

124
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:13,360
for the sensing we went with

125
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:16,400
a variable setup so in this case a

126
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,720
fully uh wireless wristband

127
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,440
because we wanted to do something that

128
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,199
is easy to wear and easy to put on

129
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,440
and to put off we had a couple of

130
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,720
iterations on that

131
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,840
and we decided then for

132
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,719
electrodermal activity and also hard

133
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,838
activity

134
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,399
to sense because there's some related

135
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,519
work

136
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,159
that link these sensors to

137
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,080
engagement stress and also excitement

138
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,560
measures

139
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,680
and the question then was also where to

140
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,880
sense it first

141
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,839
we went with a couple of wristbands and

142
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,959
also

143
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,640
um kind of commercial approaches or half

144
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,959
commercial approaches

145
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,040
however the sensing quality was just not

146
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:05,119
good enough especially from the wrist

147
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,120
you cannot really get uh good

148
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,760
electrodermal activity so galvanic skin

149
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,920
response it's small as a sweat sensor

150
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:18,080
so that means that you can detect

151
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,640
um just if somebody is sweating and some

152
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,440
of the

153
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,439
sweat is then related to a stress

154
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,080
response

155
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,680
and in that case there are a couple of

156
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,440
ways to measure that so

157
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,519
it could be on the lower part of your

158
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,360
hand or also on the fingers these are

159
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,760
usually the best positions

160
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,360
so we used the fingers over the fingers

161
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,519
we can also get

162
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,240
heart rate activity and in addition to

163
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,279
that

164
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,360
there's also a small motion sensor so

165
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,760
a gyro and an accelerometer in the

166
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,279
wristband we haven't used that for the

167
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,000
performance right now but

168
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,000
we still have the recordings also from

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,399
the audience for that

170
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,279
when i say we i mean uh george

171
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,440
especially and

172
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,439
also ding ding to researchers that work

173
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,720
with me that actually took care of the

174
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,600
designs

175
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,320
so then um the question was also how to

176
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,079
map it

177
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,600
to um the environment or the staging

178
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:17,920
in this case actually um this was done

179
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,360
by a different team this was done by the

180
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,479
embodied media team

181
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,920
also at kmd so i know a little bit about

182
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,240
it but i'm definitely not an

183
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:31,279
expert and for the initial design

184
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,000
we thought we use

185
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,959
the eda for the movement speed of the

186
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,160
projection so the eda rate of change

187
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,560
is mapped to movement

188
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,839
of these blobs that you could see or

189
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,920
also the mesh

190
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,120
that you can see and the color

191
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,240
represents

192
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,640
the heart rate we went for the lf hf

193
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,000
feature that's a low frequency high

194
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,480
frequency ratio

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,560
and should give you according to related

196
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,560
work some indication about excitement

197
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,560
for the lights the lights were also

198
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,760
bound to the heart rates in this case

199
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,560
the beats per minute

200
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,959
and they were mapped to intensity so if

201
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,518
the beats per minute of the audience go

202
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,518
collectively up the light gets brighter

203
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,079
otherwise it's dimmer

204
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,440
for the audio we had an audio designer

205
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,160
that cared about

206
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,519
sounds and faded in and faded out

207
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,360
specific sounds

208
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:31,360
also related to the eda

209
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:35,200
to the relative rate of change of the

210
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:38,240
electrodermal activity all this

211
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,360
happened while the sensors were

212
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,120
connected over sensing server in qt to

213
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,160
touch designer

214
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,480
software that generated these type of

215
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,079
projections and

216
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,320
also the music got fed into

217
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,199
and that was then actually then

218
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,320
controlling

219
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:02,480
the feedback to the dancers

220
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:05,680
if you want to have a bit more of detail

221
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,279
i uploaded the

222
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,880
work in progress preprint paper a draft

223
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,320
of an accepted ti

224
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,240
paper so in case you're interested in

225
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,240
the the mappings and the design

226
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,839
decisions for the projections

227
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,279
there's a little bit more information

228
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,480
there i'm also happy

229
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,560
later on to answer a bit of those

230
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,839
questions however i will probably just

231
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,560
forward them to

232
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,040
the designers that worked on them and

233
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,239
then for the overall performance

234
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,639
what happened was we started out with an

235
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,519
explanation of the experience

236
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,639
so it was already advertised as a

237
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,920
performance

238
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,560
that would take in electrodermal

239
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,000
activity and heart rate activities so

240
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,638
people that

241
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,279
bought tickets or came to the event

242
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,639
already

243
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,120
had a little bit of background

244
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,120
information we of course made also sure

245
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,440
that we explained at the beginning what

246
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,639
type of sensing we will be using

247
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,680
also what uh the risks and uh problems

248
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,040
with this type

249
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,439
of sensors and

250
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,199
data collection is and then audience

251
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,000
could decide

252
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,959
with inform consent if they just want to

253
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,279
stream the data

254
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,839
don't want to do anything or they want

255
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,279
to stream and also contribute the data

256
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,360
uh anonymously to our research and then

257
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,480
when the performance started we had a

258
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,959
couple of

259
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,240
uh pieces and parts that something that

260
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,800
you can see in b

261
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,639
where we showed the live data feed from

262
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,000
all of the audiences in

263
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:43,600
individuals tiles we had that in before

264
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,720
just for debugging but actually the

265
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,040
audience

266
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,399
liked that and so we made it a part of

267
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,079
the performance

268
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,079
also deciding with the choreographers to

269
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,279
include that and then for the rest as

270
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,880
you see in

271
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:02,399
c we have the individual objects

272
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,040
these blob objects that move according

273
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,079
to

274
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,279
the eda data and

275
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:12,560
change a color based on the

276
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,839
heart rate information so the

277
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,560
low to high in d frequency

278
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,440
see also these clouds and here similarly

279
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,560
the size

280
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,959
is uh is

281
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,119
related to the heart rate data and the

282
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,880
movement again is eda

283
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:34,320
and there's also one scene in e where

284
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,760
the dancers pick one person in the

285
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,560
audience

286
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,760
and ask them to come on stage and then

287
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,518
we will display

288
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:47,040
that audience members data

289
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:50,160
at a large in the back of the projection

290
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,959
and for the rest again we're using this

291
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,920
excitement data from the heart rate and

292
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,518
from

293
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:01,920
the electrode activity

294
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,920
to change sizes and colors

295
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,120
so for to come up with this

296
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:13,599
design we went the co-design route

297
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:16,240
discussing with the researchers dancers

298
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,760
visual designers audio designers a

299
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,320
couple of times

300
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,319
and actually that's also how i got

301
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,079
involved first because

302
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:29,440
the initial ideas also from the

303
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,040
primary designer of this piece were to

304
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,880
combine somehow

305
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:38,079
perception and motion and i worked

306
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:41,040
a bit in research with eye tracking

307
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,719
so you see on the screen the pupil labs

308
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,079
eye tracker it's an open source eye

309
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,320
tracking solution

310
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,719
and also eog electro-oculography

311
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,959
electro-oculography

312
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:56,000
glasses that use the

313
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,560
capacitance of your eyeballs to detect

314
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,160
something rough about eye motion and we

315
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,119
thought at the beginning we want to

316
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,719
combine

317
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,839
this a person seeing the

318
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,360
play with the motions of the dancers and

319
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,959
understand that better so

320
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,880
that's kind of how it started the

321
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:21,040
uh second inspiration for

322
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,680
this um idea in the theater idea came

323
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,199
from

324
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:28,719
a visiting scholar jamie jamie ward

325
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,880
came over and his work with the flute

326
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,680
theater in london that's an inclusive

327
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,320
theater

328
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,199
that also does workshops or shakespeare

329
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,240
workshops

330
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:41,359
and he did some sensing just with the

331
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,920
accelerometer and gyroscopes or inertial

332
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,720
motion

333
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,759
wristbands to detect interpersonal

334
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,800
synchrony

335
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:52,959
between participants in these workshops

336
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,560
and then we thought when he came over we

337
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:59,119
had a small piece where we looked into

338
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,880
this interpersonal synchrony again in

339
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,880
face-to-face communications

340
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,959
i mean now we are remote and i'm just

341
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,679
talking into a camera and i cannot see

342
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,199
anybody

343
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,880
but usually if you would have a

344
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,000
face-to-face conversation

345
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,360
it doesn't happen too often anymore

346
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,079
unfortunately

347
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,039
we would show some type of synchrony so

348
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,678
you know kind of

349
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,760
uh ibling had not and so on would

350
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,520
synchronize with the other person

351
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,679
if you're talking to them and we also

352
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,559
showed that in a small recordings also

353
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,840
we showed that

354
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,280
that we can recognize this in a variable

355
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,799
sensing setup so again

356
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,960
using some glasses and we thought

357
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,559
why don't we try to scale that up why

358
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,840
don't we try and see

359
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,399
what happens in theater performance or

360
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,799
in another dance performance

361
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,039
and see if we can recognize also some

362
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:53,440
type of synchrony

363
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,799
and with a couple of ideation sessions a

364
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,960
couple of

365
00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:02,480
also test performances also including

366
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,880
dancers trying out glasses

367
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,799
trying out other headwear and that was

368
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,360
not really possible to use

369
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,559
for the dancers during the performance

370
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,879
we came up with an initial prototype

371
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,760
and that we tried out so in i think

372
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,120
november

373
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,240
2018 or so on um where we

374
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,159
used a couple of pupil labs and also

375
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,760
people invisible these are nicer

376
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,200
eye tracking glasses they are optical

377
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,640
eye tracking glasses so they have small

378
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,440
cameras in them

379
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,240
distributed in the audience a couple of

380
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,799
those eog

381
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,880
glasses they have also inertial motion

382
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,918
sensors in them so accelerometer and

383
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,240
gyroscope

384
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,400
and we had at the time heart rate

385
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,919
sensors however they were

386
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,120
fixed and wired to the

387
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,240
system and also the dancers wore some

388
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,399
wristbands

389
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,840
where we can could record the motion

390
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,720
data and then

391
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,678
what we did in this case is then we had

392
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,200
projections

393
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:04,160
on three frames on top of the dancers

394
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,559
one was showing the blink and the head

395
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,480
not synchronization of the audience

396
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,760
the other one showed heart rate and

397
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,000
variability

398
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,879
and the third one just showed raw feed

399
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,160
from

400
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,320
one of the eye trackers and it

401
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,919
looked more or less like this and from a

402
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,520
technical perspective we were

403
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,840
surprised because it actually worked so

404
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,200
we could screen stream around

405
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:32,720
10 glasses three eye trackers

406
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,679
and uh four five five i think uh

407
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,080
heart rate sensors at the same time and

408
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,120
the

409
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,600
server worked however from um

410
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,918
from an audience perspective a lot of

411
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,360
the feedback was the the audience didn't

412
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,919
like that just some people

413
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,959
got singled out and got the device by

414
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,880
themselves

415
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,000
and others could not really contribute

416
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,919
and could not also see

417
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
the data and then also from a

418
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,080
performance perspective

419
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,919
the dancers didn't really like that they

420
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,600
couldn't interact with the data the

421
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:05,600
dance piece also in this case was

422
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:09,280
pre-choreographed so there was no

423
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,280
possibility for the dancers to really

424
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,840
interact with the data and then also

425
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,879
again

426
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,879
from an aesthetic perspective

427
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,720
we really didn't like that the screens

428
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,240
were on top because either you would

429
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,120
concentrate on

430
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,840
the screens or you would on concentrate

431
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,479
on the dance performance and you had to

432
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,039
kind of make a decision also on what

433
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,159
type of visualization you would focus on

434
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:37,120
so overall you know kind of partly okay

435
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,039
but still there were some some trouble

436
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,000
so one was definitely we wanted to

437
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,200
include

438
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,679
all of the audience meaning

439
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,520
uh we wanted to have everybody

440
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,960
participate

441
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,120
then the problem with that part was then

442
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,960
also you know having enough eye trackers

443
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,320
or having enough

444
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,960
head worn devices was an issue

445
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,240
in addition to that you know kind of if

446
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,240
it's had worn

447
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,159
some people might not like it the

448
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,640
pandemic hadn't started yet when we did

449
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:12,159
the recordings however there was already

450
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,640
uh the uh information some information

451
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,440
about a virus going around so we didn't

452
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,120
really want

453
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:22,080
as putting you know everybody

454
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,120
giving everybody some eyeglasses so then

455
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,158
we moved to

456
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,799
the heart rate and galvanic skin

457
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,000
response

458
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:33,440
solution and the setup where the

459
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,400
projection is now part of the

460
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,320
stage so we use the two walls but we

461
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,280
also use it's a little bit hard to see

462
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,360
in the images

463
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:45,360
but we also used the floor as a um

464
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,199
another projection surface for the

465
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,439
dancers to interact with

466
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,559
and the main interaction actually came

467
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,559
then over the sound

468
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:00,720
so then moving over um to

469
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,000
the lessons learned so what did we take

470
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,200
away from

471
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,200
from that experience

472
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:13,439
and the first

473
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:17,039
part was talking with

474
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:20,159
dancers and talking with the audience

475
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,240
often if you saw especially the more

476
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,440
intricate the more abstract the

477
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,080
visualizations

478
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,720
it was sometimes hard to interpret also

479
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,120
how

480
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,720
their own data would feed into that

481
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,879
visualization so you know kind of some

482
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,440
audience members mentioned to some point

483
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,640
in time

484
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,840
they were not sure if they're

485
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,720
influencing anything or

486
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,720
if it had an effect on other parts

487
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,080
especially if they saw the live data it

488
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,480
was kind of obvious

489
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,520
but for future work we really want to

490
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,000
play more

491
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,960
with the agency and also perceived

492
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,559
agency

493
00:22:52,960 --> 00:23:00,080
of the audiences and the performers and

494
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:02,240
we also really wonder how can we measure

495
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,320
these type of feedback loops because now

496
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,080
we have these recordings we looked also

497
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,360
a little bit more into the data

498
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,559
but it's hard to understand

499
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,918
were we successful

500
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:20,960
i think in some extent maybe yes because

501
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:24,000
the experience was fun it was enjoyable

502
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,840
but on this level of did we really

503
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,240
create feedback loops and how to

504
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:32,158
evaluate feedback loops that something

505
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,360
that we want to address in future work

506
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,120
on the other hand what was surprising i

507
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,719
mentioned before

508
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,439
the raw data was something that

509
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,720
the dancers as well as the audience

510
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,760
really liked and

511
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,080
that was surprising for me because

512
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,960
i thought we had to hide that more or

513
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,360
less but

514
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,520
we had it on as i said as kind of a

515
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,719
debug at the beginning of some

516
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,520
test screenings and the audience members

517
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,760
were interested in it and could see and

518
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,879
were talking about oh see your heart

519
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,039
rate is going up or your eda is going up

520
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,000
and the dancers also like that and we

521
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,158
use that then

522
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,120
in the performance in the three

523
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,480
performances

524
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:20,559
that we then successfully

525
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,960
um made for especially scenes where the

526
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,039
dancers would interact directly

527
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,799
with parts of the audience at the

528
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,480
beginning of the play

529
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:34,158
is a scene where the dancers give out

530
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,679
business cards to some audience members

531
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,159
and it was fun to see

532
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,240
that some audience members could

533
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,080
identify themselves or the audience

534
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,880
members would identify

535
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,279
somebody else that was sitting next to

536
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,400
them and then this member had a

537
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,679
spike in eda because of the surprise so

538
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,840
there was really

539
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,120
kind of some interaction going on so

540
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,120
maybe staying

541
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,360
if you're planning to do a similar event

542
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,799
staying close to the raw data

543
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,678
and also low latency is i think

544
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,960
quite important for some types of these

545
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,840
interactions

546
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,799
from the dancers there was a big

547
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,959
interest

548
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,600
one on the one side they wanted to use

549
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,440
the data for

550
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,240
reflections so they really liked that

551
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,039
they had the printouts of the effects

552
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,240
of the audience later on however they

553
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,600
also

554
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,960
wanted to dance more with biometric data

555
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,918
and also

556
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,400
use that for their rehearsals more so of

557
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,039
course

558
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,480
you know we had a co-design so we worked

559
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,279
directly we showed

560
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,279
the dancers the sensors and the

561
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,240
possibilities and then worked with them

562
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,200
to figure out

563
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,279
what can work and what cannot work and

564
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,240
what might have an effect what might not

565
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,720
have an effect

566
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,159
and then we did some as you saw also

567
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,000
some prototype

568
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:58,720
screenings and also some internal

569
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
rehearsals where we used some recorded

570
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,559
data we used

571
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,559
some a couple of people of us were

572
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,960
sitting in the audience we got a couple

573
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,039
of

574
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,320
other researchers and also students

575
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,799
involved to sit in the audience to

576
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,760
stream data and we also worked a little

577
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,960
bit with

578
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,879
pre-recorded experiences and also

579
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,360
synthetic

580
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,360
experiences how we envisioned that the

581
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,320
data would move but still it was not

582
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,158
enough

583
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:30,720
in terms of providing an intuitive way

584
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,120
to understand what is going on

585
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,400
especially also for the visualizations

586
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,239
and the projections

587
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:41,279
they were harder to interpret than the

588
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,799
sound and the sound sphere

589
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:48,320
so and then the the next and the

590
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:51,679
the biggest point maybe as well

591
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,678
is the sensors and

592
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,200
feature best practices so we're still

593
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,480
wondering you know

594
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,679
what to use we're still searching what

595
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,039
kind of

596
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:06,240
sensing equipment can we use to relay

597
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:09,279
this in this invisible link between

598
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,799
audience and performers and how can we

599
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:14,480
augment that

600
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:16,480
we started out with the perception and

601
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,120
eye tracking parts

602
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,520
we then went to a wrist one device

603
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,799
because it's easier to maintain and it's

604
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,559
also wireless and

605
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:30,240
it worked quite well to stream 50

606
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,120
to 60 audience members for one of those

607
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,799
events

608
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:38,158
to a wireless router and do the

609
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:41,200
recording as well as the live

610
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:49,840
visualization with it however

611
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:49,840
the features might have not been

612
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,679
okay yeah sorry for the

613
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:51,200
[Music]

614
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:54,720
short part where it was offline so

615
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:58,320
um we were talking about

616
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:01,120
the sensor features and best practices

617
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,600
so in this case we are still searching

618
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,959
for

619
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:08,240
the right type of

620
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:12,480
sensors and features to use for

621
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:18,080
this type of audience

622
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:21,200
performer interaction and we were using

623
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,600
the um yeah a

624
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,279
low frequency high frequency ratio of

625
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,519
the heart rate values and also the

626
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:30,559
relative changes of the eda

627
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:34,000
and that was working

628
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,600
i would say not that well compared to

629
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
other features that we now

630
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,158
found while looking into the

631
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,600
performances and the recorded data of

632
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:45,519
the around

633
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,480
98 participants that agreed to share the

634
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,679
data with us

635
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,000
um for these performances and from the

636
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,519
preliminary analysis that something

637
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,360
uh karen hun one of our researchers

638
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,440
working on and looking into

639
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,199
you know kind of what type of features

640
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,320
are indicative of changes

641
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,840
in the performance

642
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,399
it seems that a feature called pnn

643
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,959
that's related to heart rate variability

644
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,799
to the

645
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:17,679
rr intervals is

646
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,039
seems to be quite good and also the peak

647
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,760
detection per minute

648
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,799
using the eda data so we're just

649
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,960
counting the

650
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,840
relative changes the relative up and

651
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,760
down

652
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:32,399
for the eda if you're interested

653
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,080
i'm happy to share the data with you so

654
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:37,518
we have three performances

655
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,480
each around an hour and 98 participants

656
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,679
in total

657
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:45,279
and we have the heart rate data

658
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:49,279
the eda data from the two fingers

659
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,279
as well as uh the

660
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,439
um motion data as well we haven't used

661
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,678
the motion data at all

662
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,120
except for filtering out a little bit

663
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,200
the

664
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,799
eda and heart rate data because you know

665
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,080
if you're moving a lot

666
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:06,799
you will have some errors and some

667
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,158
problems some motion artifacts in it but

668
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:12,879
what do i mean with

669
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:15,840
why is the pnn or why is the eda

670
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,159
peak detection so nice let's look a

671
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,439
little bit closer into the data and here

672
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,760
you see

673
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,120
i just highlighted performance three

674
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,760
from the previous plots

675
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:31,439
you see pnn 50 on the left side is the

676
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:34,080
um the scale

677
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,880
the blue line gives you the average of

678
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,039
the

679
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:42,559
pn50 value so this is the

680
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:45,200
rr interval related

681
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:47,200
heart rate variability feature and that

682
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,559
feature is especially

683
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,519
related to relaxation and also to stress

684
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:55,360
so usually a lower pnn value appearing

685
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,159
at 50 value means you're

686
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,439
more relaxed and a higher value means

687
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,679
your

688
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,960
higher value means that you are a more

689
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,279
relaxed sorry a

690
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,480
lower value means that you are more

691
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,800
stressed out

692
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,199
so what happens now in the performance

693
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,240
is something that fits very very well

694
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,239
and correlates

695
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,598
with the intention of the of the

696
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,560
choreographer

697
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,440
because the first half of the

698
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,879
performance

699
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:26,480
so you see section one two three four

700
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:29,040
five and six um on the bottom

701
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,359
the first half of the performance is to

702
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:35,279
create a conflict

703
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:37,199
in the audience and to stir them up a

704
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,079
little so for example also the business

705
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,799
card scene

706
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,520
is part of that part or also the scene

707
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,320
where

708
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,960
uh somebody gets brought from the

709
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,839
audience

710
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,800
to the stage and uh joins the

711
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,520
performance

712
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,480
is also part of that versus the latter

713
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,040
part is

714
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,359
more about reflection and also

715
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,880
relaxation so taking in what you

716
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,319
experienced at the first part

717
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,720
and that's something that you see

718
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,599
actually quite nice in the pn and 50 so

719
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,160
at the beginning

720
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,440
it's rather low that means the audience

721
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:11,040
is

722
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:14,240
slightly tense versus in the latter part

723
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,359
they're more relaxed similarly the

724
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:20,879
eda and the bottom as a bar chart

725
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:23,040
gives you indication of a lot of peaks

726
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,760
happening at specific points and these

727
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,040
points

728
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,079
correlate very well to memorable scenes

729
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,480
in the performance so

730
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,560
seeing the one scene where actually

731
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,280
section four the red one is the one

732
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,520
where

733
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,800
somebody from the audience gets brought

734
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,040
onto the stage

735
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:46,960
uh versus i think around minute 12

736
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:50,160
uh a scene where the um

737
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,040
dancers uh hand out the

738
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,640
business cards and that's also something

739
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,560
i think so it's promising

740
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,078
we're not there yet definitely from the

741
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,880
data analysis

742
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,839
part but there are some interesting

743
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,960
things to see

744
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:06,560
and that kind of brings me back to the

745
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,880
starting point so

746
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:12,880
i think um it's what was

747
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,920
an amazing experience actually working

748
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,640
with a lot of

749
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,839
talented people on that and the

750
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,720
performance was

751
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,759
a lot of fun but we are slowly moving

752
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,078
towards

753
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,040
putting the audience on stage and trying

754
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,359
to break

755
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,040
uh the fourth wall i think with these

756
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:31,119
type of setups and

757
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,320
that leads me then also to the end of

758
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,599
the talk

759
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,520
um where i just uh have to

760
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,200
do a shout out for the people who did

761
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,800
the actual work so

762
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:46,480
all of the talented performers

763
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,800
and the project lead especially so muy

764
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,599

765
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,280
between

766
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:56,640
the artistic side and the dancers

767
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,320
with madmossel cinema and us uh as well

768
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,440

this work to you and now i'm open for a

774
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,160
couple of questions

775

i haven't really gotten a link or

778
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,440
anything but i'll probably

779
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,480
just post something on twitter or

780
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,599

to stay in contact i'll try to get

782
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,440

who worked on the visualizations on the

786
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:52,400
data analysis might be available

787
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,240
and if you interested in that just send

788

00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,839
the attention

794
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,040
thanks kai for this nice talk

795
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,079
for the audience please excuse us for

796
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,040
the small disruption of service we had

797
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,040
here

798
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,640
we're a little bit late already but i

799
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,279
think we still have

800
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,598
time for a question or so unfortunately

801
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,240
i don't see anything here online at the

802
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,359
moment

803
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,720
so if somebody tried to pose a question

804
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,640
and there was also a disruption of

805
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,959
service i apologize

806
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,839
beforehand for that on the other hand

807
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,040
now

808
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:42,560
kai you talked about data sharing so how

809
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,520
can the data be accessed

810
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,759
do people need to access you or to drop

811
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,800
your mail personal message

812
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:54,560
yeah we we are on the

813
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,440
so right now also the no publication is

814
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,599
still accepted

815
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,119
and there's also some issues actually a

816
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,280
little bit of

817
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,839
some rights issues or so on so the

818
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:08,560
easiest part is just to send me a mail

819
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:12,320
it will be posted sometime next year

820
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,759
on uh also on public on a more public

821
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,240
website but

822
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,160
the easiest is just to post me a mail

823
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,118
there already a couple of

824
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,960
people working on it and we have the the

825
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,839
rights to share it it's just a little

826
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,560
bit of

827
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:28,320
a question of setting it up i wanted to

828
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,359
have the website also online

829
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,040
before the talk but yeah as with the

830
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,640
technical difficulties and so on

831
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,839
everything is a little bit harder this

832
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,879
year

833
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:42,640
indeed indeed thanks kai

834
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,960
um yes i would say that's it for

835
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,118
this session thank you very much again

836
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,800
