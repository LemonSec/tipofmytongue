10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,480

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,360

have fun enjoy the talk no filter for

18
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,440
the right wing for the right for

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:59,840
right-wing

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,839
people by corrective have fun

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,840
a white baby a blonde white baby

22
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,560
a little bit of decoration the warm

23
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,439
light looks

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,439
um good

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,920
669 people like it who looks at it

26
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,158
whenever you're looking at it more

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,880
closely

28
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,360
it means something different for them

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,600
this is

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,280
a little big child that will be

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,960
responsible for

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,000
that will be ready for spring attacks

33
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,000
the wooden

34
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,560
the wooden circle is supposed to be

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,000
a black sun so this is a small child

36
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,280
next to a neo-nazi motif

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,719
and welcome to the bad side of the

38
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,240
platform this is what we wanted to look

39
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,839
at

40
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,160
so even after short research we knew

41
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,878
that this post is only one of many when

42
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,000
you're right

43
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,760
there if when you're white there's no

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,200
upgrade don't mix

45
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,640
so there's this is a world

46
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,879
that really doesn't really attract us

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,760
and we really have discussed when we're

48
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,040
looking at this

49
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,160
we that's a five people team from

50
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,440
five reporters alice echtermann till

51
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,560
arnold celsia and me clements who

52
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,400
who is responsible for the data analysis

53
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,280
and then there's uh all of the

54
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,280
corrective teams

55
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,519
myself this is my first data journalism

56
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,560
project

57
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,160
and i'm really happy to be here

58
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:57,280
representing the team to show you all

59
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,280
our research no filter for the right

60
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:04,959
this next 40 minutes is about

61
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,519
instagram and the right wing data

62
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,800
this is about how they are using

63
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,239
instagram

64
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,360
and it's also a report of how

65
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,159
we took this data set of

66
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,040
four and a half million instagram users

67
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,440
and how we

68
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,040
researched it why instagram it's one of

69
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,239
the most common apps

70
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,359
currently on a first look it looks

71
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,560
really

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,680
really plain and not really dangerous

73
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,440
it looks like nature photo photos travel

74
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,680
blogs and stuff there's more than 20

75
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,879
million people on there german people

76
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,560
and half of them are young people

77
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,560
so there's a lot of young people

78
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,680
when they're when they're looking for

79
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,599
their identity

80
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,360
and they really are touching with the

81
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,480
right scene

82
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,519
and the number and the size of right

83
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,679
and right extreme contents is larger

84
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,400
than i expected at least i personally

85
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,439
thought though

86
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,560
i thought so i personally had never been

87
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,680
in touch with

88
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,720
right-wing right-wing data

89
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,040
right-wing content on instagram instead

90
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,480
of

91
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,279
twitter where it is more across bubbles

92
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,478
within instagram there's only you you

93
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,918
only stay within your own

94
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:24,960
bubbles so

95
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:28,000
i've showed you some

96
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,758
we have some examples um here

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,199
like um twit like users like politicians

98
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,479
and even some posts that really look

99
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,520
um not very dangerous there's some

100
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,479
subtle

101
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,039
subtleties this picture for example is

102
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,560
from

103
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,600
lisa liman who looks at um

104
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,440
who's in the young alternative the young

105
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,560
alternative party which is a right-wing

106
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,280
party in germany

107
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,479
and this looks kind of not dangerous a

108
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,239
young person

109
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:04,320
drinking her coffee and the

110
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:08,000
but the script says taking a break

111
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,560
with um coffee that is

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,520
by someone so it basically says well

113
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,960
germany is

114
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,080
still occupied by uh allied

115
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,120
powers other hashtags like photo

116
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,320
picture winter show that um even when

117
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,360
you're looking for

118
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,759
not for harmless hashtags

119
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,440
you will find this picture this is only

120
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,800
one example of many

121
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,840
this these examples are enough to show

122
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,880
to be able to map the network of the new

123
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,919
right-wing party we knew that we needed

124
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,280
many much data for this and this is what

125
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,560
we want to start with

126
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,400
that's why we're first looking at what

127
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,039
data you can actually get from your

128
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,080
instagram

129
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:55,360
profile in my opinion that's four

130
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,159
parts first of all is like um metadata

131
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,400
and

132
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,160
common profile information so that's

133
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,120
basically names

134
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,160
and for all of the posts that this

135
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,400
person has made

136
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,199
there's data on like how many likes how

137
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,280
many comments

138
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,039
when was it published and then there's

139
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,239
hashtags

140
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:17,680
and some of the posts also have um

141
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,360
subtitles basically the second part

142
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:25,199
is connection data so who

143
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,560
follows this account and it's a text

144
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,560
who does this account follow

145
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,319
the third thing is text data so like um

146
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,680
the subtitles the description what's on

147
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,240
the picture stuff like this

148
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,960
and the fourth is like um subjective

149
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,319
data

150
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,039
so qualitative data

151
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,080
what does this what does this picture

152
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,880
look like to me

153
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,680
what emotion does it convey this helps

154
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,880
to

155
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,000
um understand all of the other data what

156
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,880
is missing in this

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,240
is are the stories these are only these

158
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,319
are only

159
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,319
available for 24 hours so we weren't

160
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,240
able to look at them

161
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,240
but there's still lots and lots of data

162
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,280
that we do have so we've set up a

163
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,720
database

164
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,440
to basically save all of the data

165
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,400
this allowed us to also save changes in

166
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,199
the data

167
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,039
but we also needed is a sampling method

168
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,000
because we need we wanted to

169
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,479
trust our sampling we couldn't just take

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,520
some

171
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,440
accounts random instead

172
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,680
what we did is exponential

173
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,080
discriminative snowball sampling

174
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,199
it sounds very fancy but it is actually

175
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,758
quite easy

176
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,560
we assume that each instagram account

177
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,720
follows

178
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,880
other accounts and then we follow these

179
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,800
accounts

180
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,800
and then we follow these accounts and so

181
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,000
on and so forth in theory

182
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,639
we would get to a huge sample very

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,360
quickly

184
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,240
because we know since this year how

185
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,319
exponential

186
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,759
growth works exactly like the

187
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,039
coronavirus

188
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,160
so we needed to basically stop at

189
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,318
specific points

190
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,199
we basically just filtered some of these

191
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,440
branches

192
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,319
and we look at how exactly we did that

193
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,199
but first

194
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,479
we need origin accounts from which to

195
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,759
start

196
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:16,960
so for that we

197
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,160
created a fake account we basically

198
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,000
made it look like a right-wing account

199
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,879
like it was part of the scene

200
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,479
so it would allow us to be in the scene

201
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,360
within this

202
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,639
to select our origin accounts we

203
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,080
basically started

204
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,080
following parties

205
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,439
so so because

206
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,679
all of these party people are paid by

207
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,279
com public money so we thought it was

208
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,399
very good to look at them

209
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:52,320
and then we looked at additional some

210
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:56,880
accounts within the identity movement

211
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,720
in germany that the um constitutional

212
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,800
that the constitution has basically

213
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,600
considered we need to watch them

214
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,240
and then we looked at we made sure that

215
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,640
at least

216
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,080
a second person within our team also

217
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,600
looked at this account

218
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,480
overall we had 281 origin accounts in

219
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,120
there

220
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,680
most of these accounts came directly

221
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,000
from

222
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,959
afd which is the german right-wing party

223
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,320
in parliament

224
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,399
so obviously it's not exactly a

225
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,399
perfect sample there's a good chance

226
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,200
that we missed some other groups

227
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,920
in parallel to these original accounts

228
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,519
we also

229
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:37,680
included a control group that basically

230
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:41,760
includes vips and influencers

231
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,959
and some accounts from our environment

232
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,880
we wanted to also find some content that

233
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,040
isn't only found within these

234
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,279
right-wing bubbles so let's look at

235
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,160
what we did first of all we looked at

236
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,439
all the

237
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,560
connections from 281 accounts

238
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:05,040
we looked at those following

239
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,040
those that these origin accounts were

240
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,880
it was 85 000 profiles

241
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,920
and many of them were only followed by

242
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,000
one person

243
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:21,439
so we chose to use a criterion which

244
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,640
so we needed in order to stay in the

245
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,680
sample an account

246
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,480
needed to be followed by at least three

247
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,519
of our origin accounts and that was a

248
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,880
couple

249
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,920
that was 4532 accounts and then

250
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,800
we followed additional

251
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,360
accounts and then we had 800 000

252
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,000
accounts

253
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,959
so then we had a second criterion we

254
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,279
wanted to

255
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,920
account we wanted to keep accounts that

256
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:51,600
were important for our original accounts

257
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,880
so every origin every account became

258
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,800
one point became points for

259
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,600
different connections we basically gave

260
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,760
them different points

261
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,399
and to stay in the sample you need to

262
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,519
have a specific number of points

263
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:10,320
this number seems random

264
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,120
and basically chosen by us and it is but

265
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,920
we needed to

266
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,279
basically balance having a sample size

267
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,839
that we can work with

268
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,560
and having enough coverage and this

269
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,399
seemed to be

270
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,399
the best compromise so we had 10 805

271
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,320
accounts overall

272
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,320
more than a third was private and we

273
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,800
couldn't use it

274
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,279
and in the third step we basically

275
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,479
categorized these accounts into

276
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:39,200
important or not important

277
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,040
not only we didn't only categorize into

278
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,000
important or not important but we also

279
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,719
categorized into

280
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,720
categories

281
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:53,519
we basically had a training using

282
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,519
some of the using a sub sample um

283
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,680
i choosing these categories and then we

284
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,519
categorized all of them

285
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,680
in order to easily make categories

286
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,720
accessible we basically allow we

287
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,638
basically made a

288
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,000
an online interface and every member of

289
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,720
the team could basically

290
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,079
look at the profile and then choose the

291
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,360
category that it should go into

292
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,439
and in addition to that there was this

293
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,600
there was the possibility of adding some

294
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,800
comments this is very interesting or

295
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,720
part of the identity movement

296
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,079
you could also skip accounts if you

297
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,160
couldn't find anything

298
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,719
or give it to some other team member

299
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,000
any account that we thought would be a

300
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,320
control group

301
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,240
or a or not very interested

302
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,440
so we actually changed the weighting in

303
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,560
our database

304
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,440
and then they basically um show

305
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,638
they basically fell out of our sample

306
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,040
even though we didn't look at them

307
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,600
specifically

308
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,639
overall we had more than 100 coding

309
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,240
sessions

310
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:05,279
with a lot of interactions overall

311
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:10,079
we spent 120 hours

312
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,079
on instagram profiles of the right scene

313
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,720
because we got a feeling for the

314
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,518
activities and

315
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,079
their preferences of this scene which we

316
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,320
didn't know

317
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,120
before six and a half thousand accounts

318
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,120
were categorized

319
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,200
over eight and a half thousand uh

320
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,680
relevant accounts

321
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,560
and we have uh found four and a half

322
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,560
thousand to be relevant

323
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,120
some of them became irrelevant because

324
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,040
they uh

325
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,480
because the network changed and the

326
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,439
dynamism

327
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,920
removed some of their criteria there

328
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,279
were

329
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,519
a bunch of accounts that we didn't

330
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,720
categorize three and a half thousand

331
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:54,000
because they were private

332
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,480
and then the dynamism caused us to miss

333
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,480
some of them

334
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,160
all of these were close to the two and a

335
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:05,199
half points that we were assigning

336
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,079
and this this final uh

337
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,199
set sample of four and a half thousand

338
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,399
we then went to

339
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:16,000
fetch all relevant data um

340
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,639
to do our assessment

341
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,279
we have 4 501 instagram accounts

342
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,560
including

343
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,839
all information profile followers

344
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,800
um post and so on

345
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,800
between those accounts

346
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,920
on the first of september 20 we finished

347
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,439
um there were

348
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,319
330 000 connections and

349
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,720
we have over 800 000 posts of those

350
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,720
accounts

351
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,399
and finally we have a category and a

352
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,000
subcategory for each of the account

353
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,639
that's the second part of the

354
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,639
presentation

355
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,480
now we'll take statistics

356
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,319
on how those accounts were categorized

357
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,320
and then we look at

358
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:10,959
one piece of data out of the metadata

359
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,959
here's the split of those

360
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:20,720
the categories ones are afd

361
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:20,719
and patriots and conspiracy theorists

362
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,880
when we look back to the origin where we

363
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,079
came from

364
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:35,839
80 percent were afd so

365
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,839
so this is very convincing

366
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,240
the subcultures is the next big one and

367
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,839
that's

368
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,680
right musicians and lifestyle

369
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,639
merchandise

370
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,638
with subcategories

371
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,839
medium-sized categories are

372
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:11,759
very very small amounts are what we call

373
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,759
real right hard right-wing

374
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,480
political parties and so on and and that

375
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:23,680
was we categorized that as a separate

376
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:27,759
group now a large part of the afd

377
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,399
is context they were

378
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,279
somehow part of afd but they didn't have

379
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,279
a political

380
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
mandate

381
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,560
maybe europe and some of them are fan

382
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,560
accounts

383
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,320
and they they would be asking for

384
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,480
somebody to become chancellor or

385
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,480
something

386
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:05,839
another large part is the patriots and

387
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,839
conspiracy theorists

388
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,559
because they had emojis and flags and

389
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:19,839
topics like migration and and uh

390
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
refugees

391
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,480
and so on

392
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,840
means up to 20 years 18 years

393
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,840
we have seen

394
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,240
and i wasn't aware of this and i didn't

395
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,480
expect it before i started this

396
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,480
fast

397
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,919
so these these young people

398
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,240
new german standard nds

399
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,840
spiders

400
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,760
and they follow people who who explain

401
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,880
this

402
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:14,559
there's also people who

403
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,559
idolize history

404
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,919
and the german right

405
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,840
now we want to look at metadata and what

406
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,840
can be done with it

407
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,520
the hour of the day and the day of the

408
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,320
week

409
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,320
when those posts were

410
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,719
the appearing organizations on the

411
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,000
left-hand side on

412
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:51,919
on the y axis there's the the day of uh

413
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:56,960
weekend and uh across is the

414
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,960
hour of the day the the

415
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,120
so monday through friday there's a lot

416
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,120
of posts

417
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,559
and they early start early in the

418
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,000
morning and

419
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:16,639
sometime in the afternoon but after 1800

420
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,640
it gets less

421
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,520
with the politicians we find less at the

422
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,600
beginning of the week

423
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,799
but we we find it throughout the day and

424
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,799
we find it also at night

425
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,919
so this is widely spread because we

426
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,960
expect because

427
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,360
politicians have different

428
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,960
preferences and uh and these accounts

429
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,840
are covered by multiple

430
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,840
uh participants

431
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:51,039
now here's the media scene

432
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:54,320
that's the media scene so they uh

433
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,320
they emphasize the day time

434
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,159
they start at 10 and 11 in the morning

435
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,559
during the media in the media area they

436
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,919
sleep in

437
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,760
in the morning and they work late at

438
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,600
night and and they work predominantly

439
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,200
during the week

440
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,360
now we're looking at the network

441
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,080
connections on how

442
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,320
the accounts interact in the network

443
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,320
fashion

444
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,479
how do how does network data work so it

445
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,760
has nodes

446
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,760
that's the four and a half thousand

447
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,760
accounts which we have taken

448
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,840
so we have uh beatrix french deutsch um

449
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,840
we have jack morton and alice

450
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,960
so the connections uh

451
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,639
who's who's following whom and only

452
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:53,520
alice is not following

453
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,520
york so this is a directed network

454
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,520
and a connection can be unilateral or

455
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,520
bilateral

456
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,559
you can see that the arrows have a

457
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,600
different width

458
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,600
they have a different strength

459
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:17,120
the stronger the edge is the the more

460
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,678
important it is

461
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,479
so mr martin is has a very strong

462
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,159
connection to

463
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:27,919
ms stark so we think about

464
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,360
how it is weighted we've tried multiple

465
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,840
things because there's no

466
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,840
real rule

467
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,080
and we've thought about what what can we

468
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:45,200
actually use a criteria

469
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:47,439
we have normalized the data

470
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,159
so here's the things that we use to

471
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,080
weight the edges

472
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,559
following each other that's an

473
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,678
expression of interest

474
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:01,280
so the the amount of commonly

475
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,280
followed accounts so if you follow

476
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,320
the same people then you have similar

477
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,520
interests and you

478
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,480
you you belong to the same group

479
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,679
so if you use similar hashtags um you

480
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,559
again share a topic

481
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,480
how often how often do they comment each

482
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:21,440
other's pictures and and how much

483
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,799
do they follow each other's pictures

484
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,799
these are factors for interaction

485
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,879
and the more frequently it happens the

486
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,120
more probable it's that they know each

487
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,120
other

488
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,959
for each pair of nodes we

489
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,439
are closer to each other than other ones

490
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,200
so with these weights we have everything

491
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,200
that we need

492
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,080
so here's the graphic that uh that is

493
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,080
generated from that data

494
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,760
the closer they are the stronger the

495
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,400
links the closer they are to each other

496
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,919
and

497
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,480
and the further they are the further

498
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,480
they are apart

499
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:23,840
we are using the commonality class

500
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,840
community detection algorithms

501
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,039
maximize the number of internal

502
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,918
connections and minimize the number of

503
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,919
external connections

504
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,720
so these are the clusters found by the

505
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,720
algorithm

506
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:47,600
and we have found a good overlap

507
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,600
we could give them easy names easily

508
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:56,480
so being close to the network

509
00:23:52,400 --> 00:24:00,480
it doesn't imply a hard

510
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:05,840
closeness but uh but it's suggested

511
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,840
so it counts from afd

512
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:21,200
and it's close to subcultures

513
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,120
so if you want to look who's interested

514
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:28,240
in what then a different

515
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:33,840
uh representation is more useful

516
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,840
so yes each node one category

517
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,000
the size represents the amount of the

518
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,000
accounts in there

519
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,840
the strength of the connection

520
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,309
[Music]

521
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,799
the color of these edges is um who's

522
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,679
being interested

523
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,320
in order to keep it in uh keep it

524
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,320
intelligible

525
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,840
so aft has a strong connection to the

526
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,840
young alternative

527
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:01,520
alternative but um but strongly in

528
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,520
subcultures

529
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,240
so with a full graphic we don't only see

530
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,840
who's interested in who but we also see

531
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,840
who's among the top four

532
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,840
all of them are connected to the media

533
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:19,120
scene

534
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:22,480
it's surprising but it's uh

535
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,000
you know it's a very interesting fact

536
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,279
because we see that

537
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,919
everybody is consuming um in content of

538
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,919
the media scene

539
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,799
the media scene takes on the topics and

540
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,799
and redistributes it

541
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,840
and that's what you see here

542
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,479
we can't always only look at the whole

543
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,279
thing but

544
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,400
we can also look at individual accounts

545
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,760
two

546
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:57,440
values are important

547
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,440
eigenvectors and between the centrality

548
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:07,840
so the first one is somebody's as

549
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,840
important as the accounts that they know

550
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,039
how are they

551
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,760
in the instagram network because they

552
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,440
are being followed by many

553
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:07,600
accounts and and by important accounts

554
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:11,600
more interesting is the other one

555
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,600
because there's lesser known ones

556
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,959
as the the

557
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,960
city council uh freiburg

558
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,918
and we haven't found that much and

559
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:31,840
there's another another

560
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,840
there's the wrapper prototype

561
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,559
we're going to put this into context and

562
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,840
that makes it interesting

563
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,840
even more

564
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,440
so now we are finding the bridges

565
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,000
between

566
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,000
those sets

567
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,840
all of these blue ones are afd

568
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,880
in gray we see the ones that follow at

569
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:10,159
least one of the two

570
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,200
and uh and our connection

571
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,720
aft is blue

572
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,440
red are the ones with a very high

573
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,440
connectivity

574
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,679
so they have a very high betweenness

575
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,600
centrality and we've already seen those

576
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,840
names

577
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,840
in the list

578
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:45,360
is a

579
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,360
fashion shop patriotic fashion

580
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:55,840
and the the known the known celebrities

581
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,840
are advertisers for that label

582
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,840
um

583
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,918
so this doesn't only show um so this

584
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,600
brand is really

585
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,240
within both politicians and young af

586
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,678
dealer

587
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:27,200
and young and young identity people

588
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,919
so it can serve as a sign that we can't

589
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,080
actually see

590
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,679
from the outside but they will recognize

591
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,840
each other

592
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,200
and then i'll look at which afd

593
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,158
politicians

594
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,120
are interested in identity poli in the

595
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,120
identity

596
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,719
movement and these are those that are

597
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,080
read here

598
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:49,520
all politicians in red here

599
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:53,279
follow at least three

600
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:55,600
accounts of these identity movement

601
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,559
of course following doesn't mean that

602
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,279
they agree

603
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,000
but it means having an interest

604
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,720
especially

605
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,679
it's these connections are especially

606
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,240
interesting because

607
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,200
the ifd said the fda basically has an

608
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,399
agreement that

609
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,960
members of party cannot become

610
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:14,639
part of the identity movement or of real

611
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,159
right extremism

612
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,559
and we've asked alice weidel how they

613
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,080
can

614
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:25,440
follow these um these followers

615
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,559
and she said well

616
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,640
we can't say whether um

617
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:34,639
following these identity movement people

618
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,640
against the the agreement that we've

619
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,080
made

620
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,799
so most of the most of them are

621
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,360
local politicians but some of them are

622
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:47,440
actually

623
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,439
within german states both of them are um

624
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,440
for example daniel freyjaf and lutzow

625
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,000
and denis

626
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,880
especially kaiser rfd is the most

627
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,159
important

628
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,080
account with within this sap network

629
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,200
because it and it's very interesting

630
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,199
because we have

631
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,559
we hadn't really considered it before

632
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,559
but it has been an

633
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,279
important node connection node within

634
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,480
this

635
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:14,480
now let's look at this kaiser was um a

636
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,279
model for the nlv

637
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,000
which is a state in germany um campaign

638
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,279
model

639
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,080
for the fd and she's she actually wants

640
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,120
to apply

641
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:28,240
for a list mandate for the um

642
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,799
federal parliament in germany

643
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,440
she follows many accounts in germany

644
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,960
especially

645
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,120
identity movement accounts also from the

646
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,720
initiative one percent

647
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,959
and she's she also doesn't really

648
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,000
agree to the agreement that they

649
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,080
wouldn't follow

650
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:51,279
these right-wing extremist parties

651
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:55,439
and she was also she also

652
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:57,440
modeled a clothing from the

653
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,519
shop that we talked about before and we

654
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,080
see that these connections that we see

655
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,039
on the platform are also reflected in

656
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,879
the reality

657
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,799
but what's interesting is that she

658
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,799
deleted all of the posts

659
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,799
also those that we can

660
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:19,039
she basically there's a couple new posts

661
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,559
but and she also um started following

662
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:24,640
some new accounts

663
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:26,879
so being able to say that she um

664
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,840
she she keeps her distance to write

665
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,399
extreme

666
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,039
positions is very it's not possible

667
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,239
lastly

668
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:38,000
we want to look at um hashtags

669
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:41,519
hashtags are important to look at themes

670
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,120
in on instagram because they are really

671
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:49,120
interesting for party

672
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:51,439
for like um the content so um

673
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,678
here we see all of the hashtags that are

674
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,039
really common within our

675
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,519
sample but not our control groups and

676
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,720
we have the number of accounts that use

677
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,399
these hashtags

678
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,640
so like fraternity merkel has to go

679
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,639
let's

680
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:17,520
and these are often used from the ifd

681
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,000
but we also have these um these hashtags

682
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,839
from

683
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,839
fraternities that are very common here

684
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,240
and it's quite interesting to us but we

685
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,119
can also understand because

686
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,000
many um people from this identity

687
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,960
movement

688
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,359
are actually part of these fraternities

689
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,040
and

690
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,399
many of these politicians were part of

691
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,599
these fraternities

692
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,719
and there's a couple of um part there's

693
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,919
a couple of hashtags

694
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:47,279
text against left extremism or

695
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:50,638
antifa and if you look at it

696
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,280
you can have an idea of the themes of a

697
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,480
specific part of our network

698
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,520
on the left side we have the most

699
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,880
common hashtags of the afg and you can

700
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:04,560
see that they are really

701
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:08,240
um quite egoistical there's lots of afd

702
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,880
um fd elect the afd

703
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,359
choose afd um ifd is important stuff

704
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,200
like this

705
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,560
there's lots of narratives that we often

706
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,118
see with afd

707
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,000
we are against the establishment the

708
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,720
only way

709
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,920
for you to reclaim your country is with

710
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,040
us

711
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,800
if it wouldn't be that bad

712
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,160
it would be quite boring actually

713
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,040
because it's what we

714
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,598
always hear on the right hand side we

715
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,240
have the

716
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,119
patriots and um conspiracy theories

717
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,279
there's we have

718
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,760
more of a focus on germany like

719
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,560
fatherland poison which is a part of

720
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,839
germany

721
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:46,960
and is often considered a

722
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:48,560
an old part and what's really important

723
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,800
is that

724
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,279
there's actually defend europe is quite

725
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,640
quite present here which is part of the

726
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,000
identity movement

727
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,240
and it's basically against the eu

728
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,040
and against the eu taking refugees as

729
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,118
well

730
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,800
and we can also see that it's often

731
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,920
about on history

732
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,640
and on the german empire

733
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,800
and then there's the hashtag nds which

734
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,680
is against this group of nds

735
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,680
and there's these right wrap scene but

736
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:23,040
what you can also do with these hashtags

737
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,160
is look at how often

738
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,079
are they present together obviously we

739
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,440
could only look at sun

740
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,920
so how many posts did the were these

741
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,520
hash

742
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:39,280
tags together in order to be shown here

743
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:42,960
it needed to be at least it needed to be

744
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,440
relevant for five percent of the

745
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,119
accounts and then and then we were able

746
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,320
to filter it a little bit

747
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,240
and then we can see sort of like a

748
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,520
thematic map

749
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:56,078
of um the themes of the right wing

750
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,560
in germany on instagram so we have in

751
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,839
blue

752
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,720
all of these different um afd type

753
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,839
things

754
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,839
merc musweg and on the left side of that

755
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,160
in the darker blue we have stuff that is

756
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,279
um

757
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,680
which is the austrian equivalent

758
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,280
to the afd and this is more about

759
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,399
feeling home

760
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,320
keeping home but the afd the german

761
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,560
community

762
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,640
usually has the word fatherland so they

763
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,759
use different words apparently

764
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,920
and then there's a couple of

765
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,200
english-speaking hashtags

766
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:34,000
and some within the

767
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,799
within the identity movement that are

768
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,240
pink

769
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:41,359
or yellow and there's a couple of

770
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:44,319
um a couple of classical instagram

771
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,640
hashtags like casual style and follow

772
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,320
that

773
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:52,078
are um that are also here

774
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:55,440
but um yeah they're not as important

775
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:58,480
and the last big cluster is hashtag

776
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,599
um is related to the hashtag fatherland

777
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,320
so fatherland

778
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,240
and it's mostly related to fraternities

779
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,800
so we've seen

780
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,919
a lot of it looking at data but there's

781
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,320
a lot of stuff that

782
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,680
wasn't measurable that you can't count

783
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,280
that where you can't have

784
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,598
numbers we asked people we um

785
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,119
interviewed people and these are also at

786
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,680
least as important as

787
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,119
the numbers so something that we thought

788
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,480
was quite interesting

789
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:31,119
um because around the black

790
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:33,760
tuesday almost all of the left-ring

791
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,800
left-wing parties basically used this

792
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,800
black square

793
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,200
but then there was at the same time this

794
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,720
white square

795
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,319
and there were a couple of conspiracy

796
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,959
theories um

797
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,160
that there are only six percent white

798
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,960
people on the world

799
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,680
anymore and these were um parallel to

800
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,480
the

801
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,839
black lives matter they used their

802
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,800
hashtag white

803
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,320
white lives matter there we have this

804
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,640
classical

805
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,800
idea that um right-wing people have is

806
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,720
we are rep we are being replaced and

807
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,320
that's only one example

808
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:14,640
of um many and we have um five

809
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:18,640
stories that we've made that you can

810
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:21,520
read on kind filter um they show

811
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,240
how important young women are for this

812
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,160
movement

813
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,279
they show how important some of these

814
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,399
meme accounts are

815
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:32,000
now now let's get back to the beginning

816
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,640
the this picture with the black sun

817
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,520
was online for more than 11 months only

818
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,879
when we

819
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,440
told them only when we told instagram

820
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,440
about it

821
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:50,320
according to instagram 350 people are

822
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:53,440
are responsible for deleting these um

823
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:57,040
extremist ideas and we

824
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:00,079
want to ask them to basically

825
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,079
follow these hashtags and to

826
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,920
investigate these hashtags now

827
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,079
apparently one of the hashtags

828
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,400
that has been deleted for a while is

829
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,680
still quite common in our data

830
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,200
instagram also has told us to

831
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,598
please um tell them more accounts to

832
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,680
please

833
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,800
send more accounts to them now working

834
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,680
filters against

835
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,319
right wing really look different it's

836
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,000
important

837
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:29,440
to actually report these

838
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,319
accounts and these pictures and

839
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,880
we need a lot better media literacy we

840
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:38,000
need to go into the schools

841
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,319
what are codes of the scene what are the

842
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,079
what do these apparently harmless

843
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:45,839
hashtags actually look like

844
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:47,280
what do these really mean now i can only

845
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,720

here

860
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,599
live on the stage and there's a couple

861
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,440
of questions

862
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:32,240
how do you define the right connotation

863
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,400
of a symbol is there an overview how do

864
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,240
you define that

865
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:41,599
okay nice yes good evening

866
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,759
simple is it's a good question

867
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,119
we have a lot of different emojis we

868
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,440
have collected them

869
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:52,720
like the old german flag

870
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,680
that um it's like an emoji for the

871
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,200
rice creek flag so different emoji

872
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,680
combinations

873
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:05,520
and some combinations of animals

874
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,520
like um boars

875
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,160
with a little bit of research you can

876
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,319
actually

877
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,680
find them and understand them even

878
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,160
though you don't actually have them at

879
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,160
the beginning

880
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,480
did you find a new aesthetic so to speak

881
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,279
so is there a right wing aesthetic of

882
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,760
instagram

883
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,240
that is different from how instagram

884
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,560
usually looks

885
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,078
i wouldn't say so no i would say the

886
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,720
dangerous thing is more

887
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,220
that it's really really similar to

888
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,279
really

889
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,279
[Music]

890
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:51,279
it could be on every mainstream

891
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,920
instagram timeline

892
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,319
that their normal hashtags are used and

893
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,920
then

894
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:59,200
they add some additional scene specific

895
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,960
hashtags

896
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:06,160
of course there's some meme sites

897
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,119
that are very very close to these um afd

898
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,000
look

899
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:12,160
there's some of them they're really um

900
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,560
common in the community

901
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,520
another question also from the internet

902
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,960
from the software

903
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:22,000
that you are using

904
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,119
you've mentioned in your presentation

905
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,560
what software have you used to get to

906
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,920
these slides

907
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:32,560
to make this easily

908
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,560
digestible

909
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,759
i'm not allowed to say anything about

910
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,119
how we got the data

911
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,079
we saved the data in a postgres instance

912
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,359
on a

913
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:47,760
ubuntu instance and the front end is a

914
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:50,880
little bit of javascript and node.js

915
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,880
api that i built

916
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,839
in the database

917
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,799
to update this and for the analysis we

918
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,200
used python

919
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,599
everything that's not caffey and we used

920
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,160
kefi for this

921
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,640
for this and we use kefi for the network

922
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,839
data

923
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:14,400
and then the slides are keynote did you

924
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,370
also look at likes and comments for the

925
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,960
interactions

926
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:20,078
[Music]

927
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,960
comments comments yes comments yes likes

928
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,079
did not

929
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,680
um follow in there because we were

930
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,680
unable to collect them

931
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,160
there were way too many of them to

932
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:33,440
collect them so

933
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:36,960
even with software with software

934
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,359
okay and maybe it's last question

935
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,440
also up to date what about the

936
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:45,040
relationship to the clear tanker

937
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,680
which are the corner deniers in germany

938
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,800
currently

939
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:51,359
it would be really interesting if we had

940
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,720
current data but unfortunately we do not

941
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:55,598
have current data

942
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,319
we have found sim we've have on

943
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,960
different

944
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,839
clearing accounts especially like

945
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,040
patriots

946
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:06,400
and um conspiracy theorists

947
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,240
we were considering the queer theme but

948
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,280
it didn't really

949
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,598
spring to mind okay then

950
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:17,040
