00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,200
all right

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,200
so

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,359
where we basically tried to treat um a

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,400
really awkward question

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,760
move in here which is technically

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,959
these ideas about inclusion and

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,960
diversity but in the end

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,840
and today we try to answer the questions

11
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,720
thank you so yes um thank you thank you

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,080
for the introduction and thank you for

13
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,479
watching invitation and thank you for

14
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,640
watching

15
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,640
again

16
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,840
experience off the ground so i'm really

17
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,840
it's a remote experience

18
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,970
[Music]

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
okay

20
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:54,559
okay uh thanks this is

21
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:57,280
not a best practice

22
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,439
and how did we get here um maybe it is

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,719
examples

24
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,199
but they are minor

25
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,199
broader

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,719
america

27
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
is

28
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,840

[Music]

32
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,840
um and then a little bit about it

33
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,840
i want to know that there is

34
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
um

35
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
um

36
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,940
[Music]

37
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,840
you can see here this is

38
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,840
these sort of consistent um

39
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,199
while they're you know they're men and

40
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,199
they're being manly yeah

41
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
um

42
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
um

43
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,840
masculinity and masculinity

44
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:57,840
um first wireless telegraphy

45
00:05:53,199 --> 00:06:01,199
and then later wireless transmission

46
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,599
from texas was a way to sort of re-fit

47
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,880
masculinity or the way the society was

48
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,880
changing it was more urban

49
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,880
and so here we see technological

50
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,120
masculinity

51
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:32,840
uh that's a training father with his son

52
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:35,840
yeah he said

53
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,840
um

54
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,199
are showing the same thing for

55
00:06:49,919 --> 00:07:03,840
masculinity which is about

56
00:06:51,199 --> 00:07:03,840
uh curiosity um

57
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,450
[Music]

58
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,039
we

59
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
um

60
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
um

61
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
uh

62
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,439
[Music]

63
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,919
but i think i hope underscore is the

64
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,919
sort of consistent

65
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,880
uh relationship with technology and so i

66
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,839
want to suggest

67
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,838
is that tech here

68
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
um

69
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,120
and so i've shown

70
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,839
and consumers of tech are implicated in

71
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,000
this tension

72
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,000
um

73
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,720
that's sort of where this comes from i'm

74
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,360
not sure how many of you thought that in

75
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:51,839
a

76
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:51,839
discussion of how um

77
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:44,249
[Music]

78
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
um

79
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
um

80
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,120
are probably either going to get run out

81
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,839
of the frame or sort of forced to become

82
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,839
civilized so this is

83
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,090
[Music]

84
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,839
like for instance

85
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,839
um

86
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,750
[Music]

87
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:26,000
[Music]

88
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,719
and you know credit for

89
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,360
dominance over control over the new

90
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,360
technology

91
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,600
in all these different ways of the

92
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,600
actual historical record

93
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,519
um

94
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:58,319
that i'm drawing from here um this is

95
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,320
a uh fair style

96
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,959
they're based in silicon valley and they

97
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,320
used to make

98
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:09,040
um associated with this

99
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,590
valley uh but they had an intermediate

100
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,689
period

101
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,690
[Music]

102
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
um

103
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,079
so jesus reservation was attractive

104
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,639
because

105
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,000
regular americans labor laws didn't

106
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,600
obtain

107
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:49,040
and they also diminished in their minds

108
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,040
oh there's this weaving

109
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:03,839
[Music]

110
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,839
particularly in this day and age

111
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,839
and so what we've got here is the sort

112
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,839
of overlay

113
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,720
um and you know now all those in those

114
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,719
laboratories and

115
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,479
the labor from the sort of managerial

116
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,479
home and so now we would think like

117
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,210
um

118
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,209
[Music]

119
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:02,320
um

120
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,560
to some people's bodies and work and

121
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,760
not to others another way that this

122
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,399
works um

123
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,839
i don't know how much people in the us

124
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,839
will remember this

125
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
um

126
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,399
doing a diy electronics assembly

127
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,399
um and so here we can see that you know

128
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:41,839
whiteness

129
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:41,839
has been a resource

130
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,480
um i'm certainly not saying that no

131
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,920
white people have been criminalized for

132
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,720
hacking because that's not

133
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,839
true but certain activities get more of

134
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,839
a pass

135
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,839
basis

[Music]

137
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,279
and really sort of policing um

138
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:37,839
celebrated funding um

139
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,079
if it can outsell something even though

140
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,600
here we also see

141
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,519
as much money to house cultural

142
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,279
and and even legal system being brought

143
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,560
to bear to to punish

144
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:03,439
certain forms of difference um

145
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,439
okay yeah

um

148
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,200
the point is capitalism is actually able

149
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,400
to sort of reconcile these in

150
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,760
contradiction um and you can also see

151
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,760
that so this is my name

152
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
is

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,840
thinking about marketing

154
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,280
abstract notions of rights and freedom

155
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,160
and their expansion

156
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,799
of success you lied the social salience

157
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,520
of racism

158
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,879
and gender as a basis of inequality even

159
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,840
as it completely recognizes

160
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,840

what is sort of always intact is even if

164
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,120
you're sort of bringing that's one group

165
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,600
saying oh you know you're part of the

171

you know there's no inconsistency

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:21,840

these

more

178
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,400
you know justice affirming this is how i

179

without really acknowledging this

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,039
because the you know

195
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,960
freedom of the individual was presented

wasn't

trying to force it because they asked

this count but she estimated

owners of space were very opposed

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,159

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,679
really surprised that

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,880

00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,720
diversity is a good one but i'm gonna

357
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,240
yeah diversity

358
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,240
is good

359
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,598
include like other forms of uh

360
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,839
um

361
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,839
um

362
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:55,839
rules having conversations

363
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,598
or

[Music]

365
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,319
the other thing i want to point out

366
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,560
though is that there's a whole lot of

367
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,560
stuff

368
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,799
that you're in and so

369
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,839
um

370
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,680
reconciliation i'm giving us examples

371
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,560
here

372
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,598
reparations land back and obviously the

373
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,839
one that's

374
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:10,000
coming for all yeah climate

375
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:12,799
is you know the biggest

376
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,800
problems

377
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:20,960
um um

378
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,880
so in conclusion um my little pixel

379
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,560
slogan is that there's no hack or tech

380
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:33,839
audit for justice

381
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:33,839
um but there are these different levels

382
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,839
um

383
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,440
it actually we were talking before um we

384
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,560
have an audience a little bit about

385
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,640
radio

386
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,640
and uh my earlier project was about

387
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,839
um

388
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,839

started working on it and maybe i saw

392
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:11,839
it's about 2015

the trump administration took it down

a channel for um polish

00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:03,200
which side are you on questions are

00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,480
easier um

403
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,680
but the sort of depth of

404
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,079
what's at stake and what's being

405

defensive

406
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:21,759
temporal is really is part of this yeah

407
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:21,760
okay um return to the isc

historical historically

people are exposed

413
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,839
and even contacted

414
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,400
boys were more likely to sort of claim

415
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,480
it as theirs

416
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,760
or take time on it or start playing with

417
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:38,800
it even a couple or a few years earlier

418
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:41,440
so yeah i haven't had those sort of

419
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,440
narratives

420
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:55,839
are thinking about these problems and

421
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,839
how they want to buy a vaccine

422
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:09,839

00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,200
around two percent great yeah so i

426
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,558
couldn't

427
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,680
um i saw a first owl flag that the

428
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:51,839
numbers inside

429
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:51,839
awesome started later research shows

430
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:09,520
and so the sort of

431
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:13,460
trajectory is the first category

432
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:16,509
that the people started to notice

433
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,510
[Music]

434
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:19,839
um

435
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,119
pretty quickly to being non-essentialist

436
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,680
and

437
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,240
again inclusive of trans and binary

438
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,640
sorts of

439
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,640
identities

440
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:51,599
i think for them to sort of deal uh

441
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,598
as head-on

442
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,759
you know um i mean these are

443
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,800
fundamentally questions of racial

444
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,960
capitalism

445
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:04,800
and so being positioned within

446
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,800
fairly well advantages

447
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,000
[Music]

448
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,680
of those issues i think there's a

449
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,480
consciousness of it but i would say it's

450
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,520
a lot

451
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:18,319
what i observed was a lot greater uh

452
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:21,119
awareness and sort of development of

453
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:21,119
potential solutions

454
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:29,839
um

455
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:43,839
[Music]

456
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,839
i think there's

457
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:57,839
it's uniquely hard i think to solve in

458
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,839
volunteeristic groups because

459
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:11,839
as well like the forces

460
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:39,839
is you know

461
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:39,839
places where there's um

462
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:53,839
uh and so saying oh you need to hire

463
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,319
this is sort of rambling and it's a

464
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,319
salmon festival

465
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:12,720
it's it's going to be easier to make

466
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,520
fairly small interventions

467
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,799
and so i think that that's like that i

468
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,759
actually have somebody talking about

469
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:21,839
china

470
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,839
to make your space more inclusive

471
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,839
it might cause there to be a sort of

472
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,839
more inclusive community

473
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:49,119

00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,839
um

475
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:31,200
of um

476
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,799
going to vary and i don't think i don't

477
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,799
think it's necessarily a binary like

478
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:41,839
you're either totally outside or you're

479
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:41,839
it could happen you know

480
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:59,920
um yeah it is kind of the place where

481
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:03,119
the idea that we're sort of

482
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:09,839
all taking so together

483
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:09,839
and start to um

485
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,760
i think having some separate spaces

00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,839

you know the artifact produced the code

um

500
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:10,000
again the historical sense that there

501
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,629
was under representation

502
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,920
of some kinds of folks

a skipped in vegas

506
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:20,960
um

507
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:29,040
the celebration of the technologist

508
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,680
is is coming in from all these other

509
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:34,079
places

510
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:36,879
in the culture and so this is uh

511
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,880
something as it were

512
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,640
godly technical apparatus and everything

513
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:58,079
else um

514
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,078
thus humanity

515
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,319
it doesn't have to be as big of a tough

516
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:11,599
as that but that's again it's all kind

517
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:11,599
of in there um

518
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:24,078
acknowledging and building um

519
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,880
forms of collaboration that are not just

520
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:28,480
sort of like

521
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:35,839
nominally non-hierarchical contributions

522
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:35,839
invisibility yeah

523
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:46,799
i always have this impression that

524
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,959
people just assume this doesn't exist or

525
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:48,960
no

526
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:03,039
i mean i think that there's a

527
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:17,839
and who knows what will be happening

528
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,520
i'll keep coming back to the tension

529
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,839
between

530
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:48,720
what as i skipped in that i think some

531
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:51,119
of the most interesting

532
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,959
volunteers and politicians um

533
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:55,039
politicians are goals for these kinds of

534
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:59,839
activities

535
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:59,839
versus what the market is

536
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:13,839
about

537
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:35,039
idea that there's something here that

538
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,039
can't just be

539
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:41,839
you know co-opted by a marketer

540
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,720
i mean i think there is a lot of there's

541
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:50,799
continuing to skip field

542
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:55,279
hackathons um these kinds of coding

543
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:55,280
board camps or hackathons

544
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:10,240
i think people look at me less weird

545
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:13,599
talking about this

546
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,598
book about radio um

547
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:24,640
really sustained work to sort of just

548
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:27,359
articulate or disentangle

549
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:29,118
um some of this from industry where it's

550
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:30,558
getting the sort of most

551
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:32,480
not just attention but sort of

552
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:37,839
celebration and the ways that that can

553
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:37,839
kind of

554
01:05:50,240 --> 01:06:05,839
good day thank you so much thank you

555
01:05:53,520 --> 01:06:05,839
thank you

556
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,839
wow

557
