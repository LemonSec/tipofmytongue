00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,520
[Applause]

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,279
welcome with me with a big round of

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,680
applause in your living room or wherever

5
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,480
you are

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,519
joram is a science communicator he got

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,039
his

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,799
university education and his first

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,160
scientific experience at max planck

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,239
institute

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,360
and he will give you now a crash course

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,480
for beginners

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,920
to have the

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,760
best insight into the scientific method

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,320
and to distinguish

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:59,839
signs from rubbish there you are this

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:59,840
stage is yours

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,039
hi nice to have you here my name is

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,200
joram schwarzman

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,159
and i'm a plant biologist and today i

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,799
want to talk about

22
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,760
science i have worked in research for

23
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,840
many years

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,240
first during my diploma thesis and then

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,159
during my doctoral research

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,920
i work both in universities and at the

27
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,439
max planck institute so i got pretty

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,960
good insights into the way these

29
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,360
structures work

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,119
after my phd i left the research career

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,759
to instead talk about science

32
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,360
which is also what i'm about to do today

33
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,240
i am working now in science

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,560
communication

35
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,640
both as a job and in my spare time when

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,360
i write about molecular plant research

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,200
online

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,040
today i will only mention plant science

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,240
a tiny bit because the topic is a

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,000
different one

41
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,920
today though we are talking about

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,159
science literacy so basically

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,920
how does the scientific system work how

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,040
do you read scientific information

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,320
and which information can you trust

46
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,000
science it's kind of a big topic

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,639
before we start it's time for some

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,200
disclaimers i am a plant biologist

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,040
i know stuff about stem research that is

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,000
science technology engineering and

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,920
mathematics

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,560
but there's so much more other science

53
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,480
out there social science and humanities

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,280
share many core concepts with natural

55
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,119
sciences

56
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,640
but have also many approaches that are

57
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,239
unique to them

58
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,839
i don't know a lot about the way these

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,360
work so please forgive me if i stick

60
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,560
close to what i know which is

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,080
stem research talking about science is

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,000
also much less precise than

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,000
doing these science for pretty much

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,280
everything that i'll bring up today

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,280
there is an example where it is

66
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,440
completely different so if in your

67
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,879
country field of research or experience

68
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,040
something is different

69
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,239
we're probably both right about whatever

70
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,000
we're talking

71
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,360
with that out of the way let's look at

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,920
the things that make science

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,879
science there are three parts of science

74
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,119
that are connected

75
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,959
the first one is the scientific system

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,720
this is the way science is done

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,720
next up we have people who do the

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,800
science the scientific term for them is

79
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,000
researchers we want to look at how you

80
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,200
become a researcher

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,360
how researchers introduce biases and how

82
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,560
they pick their volcanic lair to do evil

83
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,200
science

84
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,640
finally there are publications this is

85
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,319
the front end of science

86
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,839
the stuff we look at most of the time

87
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,359
when we look at science

88
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,680
there are several different kinds and

89
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,400
not all of them are equally trustworthy

90
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,000
let's begin with a scientific system we

91
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,400
just don't do science

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,080
we do science systematically since the

93
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,799
first people try to understand the world

94
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,879
around them

95
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,040
we have developed a complex system for

96
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,239
science at the core of that is the

97
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,239
scientific method

98
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,760
the scientific method gives us structure

99
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,000
and tools to do science

100
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,760
without it we end up in the realm of

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,959
guesswork anecdotes and false

102
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,720
conclusions

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,080
here are some of my favorite things that

104
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,000
were believed before the scientific

105
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,959
method became standard

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,640
gentlemen could not transmit disease

107
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,200
mice are created from grain

108
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,480
and cloth blood is exclusively produced

109
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,159
by the liver

110
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,518
heart-shaped plants are good for the

111
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,120
heart

112
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,720
but thanks to the scientific method we

113
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,200
have a system that allows us to make

114
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,519
confident judgment on our observations

115
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,518
let's use an example this year aged me

116
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,560
significantly and so as a newly formed

117
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,280
old person

118
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,439
i have pansies on my balcony i have blue

119
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,680
ones and yellow ones and in summer i can

120
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,199
see bees buzz around the flowers

121
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,120
i have a feeling though that they like

122
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,680
the yellow ones better

123
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,639
that right there is an observation i now

124
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,160
think to myself

125
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,919
i wonder if they prefer the yellow

126
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,040
flowers over the blue ones based on the

127
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,758
color

128
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,520
and this is my hypothesis the point of a

129
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,479
hypothesis is to test it

130
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,440
so i can accept or reject it later so i

131
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,120
come up with a test

132
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,840
i count all bees that land on yellow

133
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,840
flowers and on blue flowers within a

134
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,679
weekend that is my experiment

135
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,119
so i sit there all weekend with one of

136
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,880
these clicky things in each hand and

137
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,639
count the bees on the flowers

138
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,880
every time a bee lands on a flower i

139
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,600
click click click click click click

140
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,159
it's the most fun i had all summer in

141
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,160
the end

142
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,720
i look at my numbers these are my

143
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,880
results i saw 64 bees on the yellow

144
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,120
flowers and 27 on the blue flowers

145
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,919
based on my experiment i conclude that

146
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,800
bees prefer

147
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,880
yellow pansies over blue ones i can now

148
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,280
return and accept my hypothesis

149
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,000
bees do prefer yellow flowers over blue

150
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,919
ones

151
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,680
based on that experiment i made a new

152
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,639
observation and can now make a new

153
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,320
hypothesis

154
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,120
do other insects follow the same

155
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,000
behavior and so i sit there again next

156
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,000
weekend counting

157
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,360
all hoverflies on my pansies happy days

158
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,919
the scientists in the audience are

159
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,240
probably screaming by now i am too but

160
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,799
on the inside my little experiment and

161
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,280
the conclusions i did were floored

162
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,960
first up i didn't do any controls apart

163
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,440
from yellow versus blue

164
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,159
what about time do the days or seasons

165
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,160
matter

166
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,400
maybe i picked up the one time period

167
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,520
when bees actually do prefer yellow but

168
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,758
on most other days

169
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,960
they like blue better and then i didn't

170
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,720
control for position

171
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,799
maybe the blue ones get less sunlight

172
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,319
and are less warm and so a good control

173
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,880
would have been to swap the pots

174
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,600
around i also said i wanted to test

175
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,280
color

176
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,360
another good control would have been to

177
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,880
put up a cardboard cut out of a flower

178
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,880
in blue and yellow and see

179
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,039
whether it is the color or maybe another

180
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,440
factor that attracts the bees

181
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,880
and then i only counted once i put the

182
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,319
two data points into an online

183
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,919
statistical calculator and when i had

184
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,440
calculate it told me i had internet

185
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,440
connectivity problems

186
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,120
so i busted out my old textbook about

187
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,639
statistics and as it turns out you need

188
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,120
repetitions of your experiment

189
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,800
to do statistics and without statistics

190
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,479
you can't be sure of anything

191
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,240
if you want to know whether what you

192
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,318
measure is random or truly different

193
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,080
between your two conditions you do a

194
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,000
statistical test that tells you with

195
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,800
what probability your result could be

196
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,199
random

197
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,160
that is called a p value you want that

198
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,080
number to be low

199
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,440
in biology we are happy with the chance

200
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,280
of one in twenty so

201
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,560
five percent that the difference we

202
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,000
observe between two measurements

203
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,919
happened by chance

204
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,599
in high energy particle physics that

205
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,440
chance of seeing a random effect is one

206
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:59,680
in 3.5 million or

207
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,120
0.0003 so without statistics you can

208
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,319
never be sure whether you observe

209
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,919
something important

210
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,520
or just two numbers that look different

211
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,039
a good way to do science is to do an

212
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,880
experiment a couple of times

213
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,360
three at least and then repeat it with

214
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,039
controls again at least three times

215
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,400
with a bigger data set i could actually

216
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,759
make an observation that holds

217
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,758
significance

218
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,520
so why do i tell you all of this you

219
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,199
want to know how to understand science

220
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,198
not how to do it yourself

221
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,039
well as it turns out controls and

222
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,400
repetitions are also a critical point to

223
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,120
check when you read about scientific

224
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,120
results

225
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,800
often enough cool findings are based on

226
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,759
experiments that didn't control for

227
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,520
certain things

228
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,800
or that are based on very low numbers of

229
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,400
repetitions

230
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,000
you have to be careful with conclusions

231
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,000
from these experiments as

232
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,520
they might be wrong so when you read

233
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,960
about science look for signs that they

234
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,878
followed the scientific method

235
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,638
like a clearly stated hypothesis

236
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,240
experiments with proper controls and

237
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,879
enough repetitions to do solid

238
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,879
statistics

239
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,319
it seems like an obvious improvement for

240
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,800
the scientific system to just do

241
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,599
more repetitions well there's a problem

242
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,440
with that

243
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,199
often experiments require the

244
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,800
researchers to break things

245
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,240
maybe just because you take the things

246
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,560
out of their environment and into your

247
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,160
lab

248
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,319
maybe because you can only study it when

249
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,720
it's broken and as it turns out

250
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,400
not all things can be broken easily let

251
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,479
me introduce you to my scale of

252
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,080
how easy it is to break the thing you

253
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,599
study

254
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,199
all the way to the left you have things

255
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,440
like particle physics

256
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,960
it's easy to break particles all you

257
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,639
need is a big ring and some spare

258
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,440
electrons you put in there really really

259
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,120
fast

260
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,639
once you have these two basic things you

261
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,759
can break millions of particles and

262
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,120
measure what happens

263
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,279
so you can calculate really good

264
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,479
statistics on them then you have other

265
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,640
areas of physics

266
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,560
in material science the only thing that

267
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,120
stops you from testing how hard a rock

268
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,359
is

269
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,120
is the price of your rock again that

270
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,200
makes us quite confident in the material

271
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,320
properties of things

272
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,880
now we enter the realm of biology

273
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,279
biology is less precise because living

274
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,120
things are not all the same

275
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,959
if you take two bacterial cells of the

276
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,720
same species they might still be

277
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,880
slightly different in their genome

278
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,040
but luckily we can break millions of

279
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,040
bacteria and other microbes without

280
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,199
running into ethical dilemmas

281
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,640
we even ask researchers to become better

282
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,399
at killing microbes

283
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,399
so doing more of the experiment is

284
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,320
easier when working with microbes

285
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,000
it gets harder though with bigger and

286
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,160
more complex organisms

287
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,200
want to break plants in a greenhouse or

288
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,880
in a field

289
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,800
as long as you have the space you can

290
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,920
break thousands of them for signs and no

291
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,920
one minds

292
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,479
how about animals like fish and mice and

293
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,599
monkeys there gets much more complicated

294
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,279
very quickly

295
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,880
while we are happy to kill thousands of

296
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,640
pigs every day for sausages

297
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,480
we feel much less comfortable doing the

298
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,880
same for science and it's not a bad

299
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,279
thing

300
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,600
when we try to reduce harm to animals so

301
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,519
while you absolutely can do repetitions

302
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,360
and controls in animal testing

303
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,000
you usually are limited by the number of

304
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,480
animals you can break for science

305
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,760
and then we come to human biology if you

306
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,760
thought it was hard doing lots of

307
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,080
repetitions and controls and animals

308
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,160
try doing that in humans you can't grow

309
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,440
a human on a corn sugar-based diet just

310
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,680
to see what would happen

311
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,360
you can't grow humans in isolation and

312
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,040
you can't breed humans to make more

313
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,079
cancer as a control in your cancer

314
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,680
experiment

315
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,599
so with anything that involves science

316
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,439
and humans we have to have very clever

317
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,800
experiment design to control for all the

318
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,320
things that we can't control

319
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,079
the other way to do science on humans of

320
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,120
course is to be a genetic life form and

321
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,040
disc operating system

322
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,880
what this scale tells us is how careful

323
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,560
we have to be with conclusions from any

324
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,000
of these research areas

325
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,599
we have to apply a much higher

326
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,040
skepticism when looking at single

327
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,600
studies on human food

328
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,120
than when we study how hard a rock is if

329
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,160
i'm interested in stuff on the right end

330
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,760
of the spectrum

331
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,600
i'd rather see a couple of studies

332
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,680
pointing at the conclusion whereas

333
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,680
the further i get to the left-hand side

334
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,040
the more i trust single studies

335
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,800
that still doesn't mean that there can't

336
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,000
be mistakes in particle physics

337
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,000
but i hope you get the idea

338
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,120
back to the scientific method because it

339
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,680
is circular

340
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,519
it is never done and so is science we

341
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,439
can always uncover more details

342
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,360
look at related things and refine our

343
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,399
understanding there's no field where we

344
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,240
could ever say

345
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,320
okay let's pack up we know now

346
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,120
everything good job everyone the science

347
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,959
has been completely done

348
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,120
everything in science can be potentially

349
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,079
overturned nothing is set in stone

350
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,079
however and it's a big however it's not

351
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,920
likely that this happens for most things

352
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,519
most things have been shown so often

353
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,000
that the chance that we will find out

354
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,519
that water actually boils at 250 degrees

355
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,399
centigrade at sea level and normal

356
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,360
pressure

357
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,959
is close to zero but if researchers

358
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,320
would be able to show that strange

359
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,000
behavior of water

360
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,560
it is in the nature of science to

361
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,560
include that result in our understanding

362
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,560
even if that breaks some other ideas

363
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,399
that we have about the world

364
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,800
that is what sets science apart from

365
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,600
dogma new evidence is not frowned upon

366
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,599
and rejected

367
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,880
but welcomed and integrated into our

368
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,800
current understanding of the world

369
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,560
enough about a scientific system let's

370
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,719
talk about scientists

371
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,880
you might be surprised to hear but most

372
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,560
researchers are actually people

373
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,320
other people who are not researchers

374
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,518
tend to forget that especially when they

375
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,680
talk about the science

376
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,600
that the researchers do that goes both

377
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,920
ways there are some that believe in the

378
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,000
absolute objective truth of science

379
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,279
ignoring all influence researchers have

380
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,120
on the data

381
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,560
and there are others who say that

382
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,519
science is lying about things like

383
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,920
vaccinations

384
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,000
climate change or infectious diseases

385
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,160
both groups are wrong

386
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,160
researchers are not infallible demi gods

387
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,000
that eat nature and poop wisdom

388
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,160
they are also not conspiring to bring

389
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,720
harm to society in search for personal

390
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,719
gain

391
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,000
trust me i know people who work in

392
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,760
pesticide research

393
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,120
they're as miserable as any other

394
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,959
researcher

395
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,160
researchers are people and so they have

396
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,319
thoughts and ideas

397
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,839
and wishes and biases and faults and

398
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,519
good intentions

399
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,040
most people don't want to do bad things

400
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,360
and inflict harm on others

401
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,959
and so do researchers they aim to do

402
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,600
good things and make lives of people

403
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,199
better

404
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,920
the problem with researchers being

405
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,839
people is that they are also flawed

406
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,439
we all have cognitive biases that shape

407
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,920
the way we perceive and think about the

408
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,839
world

409
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,680
and in science there's a whole list of

410
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,000
biases that affect the way we gather

411
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,000
data and draw conclusions from it

412
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,040
luckily there are ways to deal with most

413
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,519
biases

414
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,839
we have to be aware of them address them

415
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,839
and change our behavior to avoid them

416
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,320
what we can't do is deny their impact on

417
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,639
research

418
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,639
another issue is diversity whenever you

419
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,320
put a group of similar people together

420
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,399
they will only come up with ideas that

421
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,000
fit within their group that's why it is

422
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,639
a problem when only white men are

423
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,440
dominating research leadership positions

424
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,720
hold on some of you my child these men

425
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,560
are men of science

426
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,760
they are objective they use the

427
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,079
scientific method

428
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,199
we don't need diversity we need smart

429
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,160
people

430
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,160
to which i answer

431
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,959
here is a story for you for more than

432
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,480
150 years researchers believe that only

433
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,319
male birds are singing

434
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,320
it fits the simple idea that male birds

435
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,560
do all the mating rituals and stuff

436
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,320
so they must be the singers just like in

437
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,079
humans female birds were believed to

438
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,199
just sit and listen while the men shout

439
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,279
at each other

440
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,319
in the last 20 years this idea was

441
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,320
debunked

442
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,839
new research found that also female

443
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,639
birds sing so

444
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,000
how did we miss that for so long another

445
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,680
study on the studies

446
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,279
found that during these 20 years that

447
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,000
overturned the dogma of male singing

448
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,800
birds

449
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,399
the researchers changed suddenly more

450
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,079
women took part in research

451
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,040
and research happened in more parts of

452
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,959
the world previously mostly men in u.s

453
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,880
canada england and germany were studying

454
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,800
singing birds in their countries

455
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,880
as a result they subconsciously

456
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,240
introduced their own biases and ideas

457
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,240
into the work and so

458
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,240
we believe for a long time that female

459
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,760
birds keep their beaks shut

460
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,839
only when the group of researchers

461
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,360
diversified we got new and better

462
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,199
results

463
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,720
the male researchers didn't ignore the

464
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,560
female songbirds out of bad

465
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,240
faith the men were shaped by their

466
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,119
environment but they didn't want to do

467
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,880
bad things

468
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,320
they just happened to oversee something

469
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,959
that someone with a different background

470
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,160
would pick up on what does this tell us

471
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,160
about science

472
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,920
it tells us that science is influenced

473
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,199
consciously or subconsciously by

474
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,959
internal biases

475
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,959
when we talk about scientific results we

476
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,800
need to take that into account

477
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,560
especially in studies regarding human

478
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,079
behavior we have to be very careful

479
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,719
about experiment design

480
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,319
framing and interpretation of results if

481
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,160
you read about science that makes bold

482
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,880
claims about the way we should work

483
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,639
interact or communicate in society that

484
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,079
science is prone to be shaped by bias

485
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,000
and you should be very careful when

486
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,599
drawing conclusions from it

487
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,279
i personally would rather wait for

488
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,800
several studies pointing in a similar

489
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,000
direction before i draw major

490
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,199
conclusions

491
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,560
i'll link to a story about the

492
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,399
publication about the influence of

493
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,239
female mentors on career success

494
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,040
that was criticized for a couple of

495
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,040
these biases

496
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,839
if we want to understand science better

497
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,959
we also have to look at how someone

498
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,240
becomes a scientist

499
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,479
and i mean that in a sense of

500
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,320
professional career technically

501
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,399
everybody is a scientist as soon as they

502
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,720
test a hypothesis observe the outcome

503
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,240
and repeat but unfortunately most of us

504
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,399
are not paid for the tiny experiments

505
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,160
during our day-to-day life

506
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,560
if you want to become a scientist you

507
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,639
usually start by entering academia

508
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,638
academia is the world of universities

509
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,480
colleges and research institutes

510
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,320
there is a lot of science done outside

511
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,839
of academia like in research and

512
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,920
development in re industry

513
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,480
or by individuals taking part in diy

514
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,240
science as these groups rarely enter the

515
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,600
spotlight of public attention i will

516
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,120
ignore them today

517
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,759
sorry so this is a typical stem career

518
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,519
path

519
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,199
you begin as a bachelor or master

520
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,040
student you work for something between

521
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,920
three months and a year and then woohoo

522
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,759
you get a degree from here you can leave

523
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,360
go into the industry be a scientific

524
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,759
researcher at a university

525
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,399
or you continue your education if you

526
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,839
continue you're most likely to do a phd

527
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,360
but before you can select one of the

528
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,320
exciting options on a form when you

529
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,480
order your food

530
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,880
you have to do research for three to six

531
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,720
years depending on where you do your phd

532
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,399
you work on a project and most likely

533
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,000
will not have a great time

534
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,880
you finish with your degree and some

535
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,720
publications a lot of people leave now

536
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,240
but if you stay in research you'll

537
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,839
become a postdoc

538
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,160
the word postdoc comes from the words

539
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,760
dog as indoctrinate and posed as in you

540
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,720
have to post a lot of application

541
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,720
letters to get a job

542
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,679
postdocs do more research often on

543
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,520
broader topics

544
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,199
they supervise phd students and are

545
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,559
usually pretty knowledgeable about their

546
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,319
research field

547
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,599
they work and write papers until one of

548
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,760
two things happen

549
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,719
the german visionchef ciphertrx gazettes

550
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,559
bites them in the butt

551
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,080
and they get no more contract or they

552
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,200
move on to become a group leader or

553
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,879
professor

554
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,480
being a professor is great you have a

555
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,160
permanent research position you get to

556
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,520
supervise and you get to talk to many

557
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,000
cool other researchers

558
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,918
you probably know a lot by now not only

559
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,600
about your field but also many other

560
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,360
fields in your part of science

561
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,959
as you constantly go to conferences

562
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,039
because they have good food and also

563
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,200
people are talking about science

564
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,160
downside is you're probably not doing

565
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,160
any experiments

566
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,960
yourself anymore you have postdocs and

567
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,120
phd students who do that for you

568
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,480
if you want to go into science please

569
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,239
have a look at this

570
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,160
what looks like terrible city planning

571
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,240
is actually terrible career planning

572
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,080
as less than one percent of phds will

573
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,160
ever reach the level of professor

574
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,480
also known as the only stable job in

575
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,679
science that's also what happened to me

576
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,080
i left academia after my phd

577
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,919
so what do we learn from all of this

578
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,439
different stages of a research career

579
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,400
correlate with different levels of

580
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,000
expertise

581
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,600
if you read statements from a master's

582
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,120
student or professor you can get an

583
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,840
estimate for how much they know about

584
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,840
their field

585
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,840
and in turn for how solid their science

586
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,320
is of course this is just a rule of

587
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,760
thumb

588
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,439
i have met both very knowledgeable

589
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,919
master students and professors who knew

590
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,200
nothing

591
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,480
apart from their own small world so

592
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,400
whenever you read statements from

593
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,240
researchers independent of their career

594
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,760
stage you should also wonder

595
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,240
whether they represent a scientific

596
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,760
consensus any individual scientist might

597
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,039
have a particular hot take about

598
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,879
something they care about

599
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,960
but in general they agree with their

600
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,400
colleagues when reading about science

601
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,120
that relates to policies or public

602
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,880
debates

603
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,159
it is a good idea to explore whether

604
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,320
this particular researcher is

605
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,559
representing their own opinion

606
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,080
or the one of their peers don't ask the

607
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,600
researcher directly though

608
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,520
every single one of them will say that

609
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,918
of course they represent a majority

610
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,918
opinion

611
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,039
the difference between science and

612
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,678
screwing around is writing it down

613
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,760
as adam savage once said science without

614
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,200
publications is pretty useless because

615
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
if you keep all that knowledge to

616
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,559
yourself

617
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,960
well congrats you are very smart now but

618
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,960
that doesn't really help anyone but you

619
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,799
any researcher's goal therefore is to

620
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,480
get their findings publicly known so

621
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,320
that others can extend the work and

622
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,400
create scientific progress

623
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,480
so let's go back to my amazing b

624
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,880
research i did the whole experiment

625
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,880
again

626
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,640
with proper controls this time and now i

627
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,720
want to tell people about it

628
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,320
the simplest way to publish my findings

629
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,840
would be to tweet about it

630
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,439
but then a random guy would probably

631
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,000
tell me that i'm wrong and stupid and

632
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,120
should go

633
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,760
myself so instead i do what most

634
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,199
researchers

635
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,840
would do and go to a scientific

636
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,280
conference that's where researchers hang

637
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,840
out have a lot of coffee

638
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,280
and sit and listen to talks from other

639
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,959
researchers conferences are usually the

640
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,840
first place that new information becomes

641
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,400
public

642
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,760
well public is a bit of a stretch

643
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,760
usually the talks are not really

644
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,440
recorded or made accessible to anyone

645
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,799
who wasn't there at the time

646
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,720
so while the information is pretty

647
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,639
trustworthy it remains fairly

648
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,720
inaccessible to others

649
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,240
after my conference talk the next step

650
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,520
is to write up all the details of my

651
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,080
experiment and the results

652
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,400
in a scientific paper before i send this

653
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,960
to an editor or at a scientific journal

654
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,720
i could publish it myself as a preprint

655
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,360
these preprints are drafts of finished

656
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,600
papers

657
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,520
that are available to read for anyone

658
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,600
they're great because they provide easy

659
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,200
access to information that is otherwise

660
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,799
often behind paywalls

661
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,880
they are not so great because they have

662
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,720
not yet been peer reviewed

663
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,480
if a preprint hasn't also been published

664
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,520
with peer review you have to be careful

665
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,280
with what you read

666
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,520
as it is essentially only the point of

667
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,520
view of the authors

668
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,039
peer review only happens when you submit

669
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,039
your paper to a journal

670
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,480
journals are a whole thing and there

671
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,720
have been some great talks in the past

672
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,480
about why many of them are problematic

673
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,240
let's ignore for a second how these

674
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,760
massive enterprises collect money from

675
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,360
everyone they get in contact with

676
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,600
and let's focus instead on what they're

677
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,840
doing for the academic system

678
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,678
i send in my paper an editor sees if

679
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,399
it's any good and then sends my paper to

680
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,960
two to three

681
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,240
reviewers these are other researchers

682
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,760
that then critically check

683
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,440
everything i did and eventually

684
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,320
recommend accepting or

685
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,480
rejecting my paper if it is accepted the

686
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,399
paper will be published i pay a fee and

687
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,640
the paper will be available online

688
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,720
often behind the paywall unless i pay

689
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,400
some more cash

690
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,320
at this point i'd like to have a look at

691
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,000
how a scientific paper works

692
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,158
there are five important parts to any

693
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,039
paper the title the author list

694
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,640
the abstract the figures and the text

695
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,799
the title is a summary of the main

696
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,799
findings and unlike in popular media

697
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,480
it is much more descriptive where a

698
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,918
newspaper leaves out the most important

699
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,640
information to get people to read the

700
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,080
article

701
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,840
the information is right there in the

702
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,120
title of the study

703
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,840
in my case that could be honeybees apis

704
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,520
mellifera

705
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,360
show selective preference for flower

706
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,918
color in viola tricolor

707
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,600
you see everything is right there the

708
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,880
organisms i worked with and the main

709
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,280
result i found

710
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,720
below the title stands the author list

711
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,559
as you might have guessed the author

712
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,400
list is a list of authors

713
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,240
depending on the field the paper is from

714
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,960
the list can be ordered alphabetically

715
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,080
or according to relative contribution if

716
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,760
it is contribution

717
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,600
then you usually find the first author

718
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,360
to have done all the work or the middle

719
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,959
authors to have contributed some smaller

720
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,158
parts and the last author to have paid

721
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,679
for the whole thing

722
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,280
the last author is usually a group

723
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,960
leader or professor

724
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,240
a good way to learn more about research

725
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,159
group and their work is to search for

726
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,080
the last author's name

727
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,720
the abstract is a summary of the

728
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,080
findings read this to get a general idea

729
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,039
of what the researchers did and what

730
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,199
they found

731
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,879
it is very dense in information but it

732
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,480
is usually written in a way that also

733
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,039
researchers from other fields can

734
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,159
understand

735
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:02,000
at least some of it the figures

736
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,760
are pretty to look at and hold the key

737
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
findings in most papers

738
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,240
and the text has the full story with all

739
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,640
the details all the jargon and all the

740
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,720
references that the research is built on

741
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,679
you probably won't read the text unless

742
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,080
you care a lot

743
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,679
so stick to title abstract and authors

744
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,120
to get a quick understanding of what's

745
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,400
going on

746
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,879
scientific papers reflect the

747
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,360
peer-reviewed opinion of one or few

748
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,799
research groups if you are interested in

749
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,479
a broader topic like

750
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:31,120
what insects like to pollinate what

751
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,120
flower you should read review papers

752
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,399
these are peer-reviewed summaries of a

753
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,158
much broader scope

754
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,679
often weighing multiple points of view

755
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,600
against each other

756
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,360
review papers are a great resource that

757
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,879
avoids some of the bias individual

758
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,080
research groups might have about their

759
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,120
topic

760
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,960
so my research is reviewed and published

761
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,479
i can go back now and start counting

762
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,679
butterflies but this is not where the

763
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,320
publishing of scientific

764
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,039
results ends my institute might think

765
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,879
that my b

766
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,879
counting is not even bad it is actually

767
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,679
amazing and so they will issue a press

768
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,440
release

769
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,039
press releases often emphasize the

770
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,400
positive parts of a study

771
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,480
while putting them into context of

772
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,480
something that's relevant to most people

773
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,159
something like bees remain attracted to

774
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,520
yellow flowers despite the climate

775
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,039
crisis

776
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,960
the fact in a press release are usually

777
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,240
correct but shortcomings of a study that

778
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,679
i mentioned in the paper

779
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,679
are often missing from the press release

780
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,200
because my b study is really cool and

781
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,880
because the pr department of my

782
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,440
institute did a great job

783
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,960
journalists pick up on the story the

784
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,080
first ones are often journals with a

785
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,000
focus on science

786
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,279
like scientific american or spectrum

787
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,200
division shaft

788
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,120
most of the time science journalists do

789
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,279
a great job in finding more sources and

790
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,279
putting the results into context

791
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,559
they often ask other experts for their

792
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,720
opinion and they break down the

793
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,320
scientific language into simpler words

794
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,080
science journalism is the source i

795
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,439
recommend to most people when they want

796
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,120
to learn about a field that they are not

797
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,120
experts in

798
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,479
because my b story is freaking good

799
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,000
mainstream journalists are also

800
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,600
reporting on it

801
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,440
they are often pressed for time and

802
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,000
write for much broader audience so they

803
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,320
just report

804
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,039
the basic findings often putting even

805
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,600
more emphasis on why people should care

806
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,320
usually climate change personal health

807
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,879
or now

808
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,559
covet mainstream press coverage is

809
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,360
rarely as detailed as the previous

810
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,120
reporting

811
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,279
and has the strongest tendency to

812
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,918
accidentally misrepresent facts or add

813
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,360
framing that researchers wouldn't use

814
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,120
oh and then there is your weird uncle

815
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,719
who posts a link to the article on their

816
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,840
facebook with a blob of text that says

817
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,159
the opposite of what the study actually

818
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,918
did

819
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,600
as you might imagine the process of

820
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,279
getting scientific information out to

821
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,399
the public quickly becomes a game of

822
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,400
telephone

823
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,000
what is clearly written in the paper is

824
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,760
framed positively in the press release

825
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,600
and gets watered down even more once it

826
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,600
reaches mainstream press

827
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,120
so for you as someone who wants to

828
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,959
understand the science

829
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,719
it is a good idea to be more careful the

830
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,080
further you get away from the original

831
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,919
source material

832
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,520
while specific scientific journalism

833
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,200
usually does a good job in breaking down

834
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,158
the facts without distortion

835
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,240
the same can't be said for popular media

836
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,159
if you come across an interesting story

837
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,279
try to find another version of it in a

838
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,360
different outlet

839
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,679
preferably one that is more catered to

840
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,199
an audience with scientific interest

841
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,120
of course you can jump straight to the

842
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,960
original paper but understanding the

843
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,120
scientific jargon can be hard

844
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,120
and misunderstanding the message is easy

845
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,799
so it can do more harm than good

846
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,039
we see that harm now with hobbies one

847
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:24,000
epidemic epidemiology

848
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,279
epidemiology who are not people who

849
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,039
study epidemics

850
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,440
who are making up their own pandemic

851
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,120
modeling they are cherry picking bits of

852
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,880
information from scientific papers

853
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,719
without understanding the bigger picture

854
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,559
and context and then post their own

855
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,240
charts on twitter

856
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,399
it's cool if you want to play with data

857
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,000
in your free time and it's a fun way to

858
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,080
learn more about a topic

859
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,919
but it can also be very misleading and

860
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,439
harmful while dealing with a pandemic if

861
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,159
expert studies have to fight for

862
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,120
attention

863
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,000
with non-expert exographs it pays off to

864
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,439
think twice about

865
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,200
whether you're actually helping by

866
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,600
publishing your own take on a scientific

867
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,600
question

868
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,960
before we end i want to give you some

869
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,880
practical advice

870
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,799
on how to assess the credibility of a

871
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,600
story and how to understand the science

872
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,440
better

873
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,840
this is not an in-depth guide to fact

874
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,320
checking i want you to get a sort of

875
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,360
gut feeling about science when i read

876
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,879
scientific information

877
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,959
these are the questions that come to my

878
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,840
mind first up

879
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,480
i want to ask yourself is this plausible

880
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,918
and

881
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,399
does this follow the scientific

882
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,559
consensus if both answers are

883
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,320
no then you should carefully check the

884
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,320
sources more often than not

885
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,240
these results are outliers that somebody

886
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,080
exaggerated to get news coverage

887
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,679
or someone is actively reframing

888
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,039
scientific information for their own

889
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,640
goals

890
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,960
to get a feeling about scientific

891
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,799
consensus on things it is a good idea to

892
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,840
look for joint statements from research

893
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,360
communities

894
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,439
whenever an issue that is linked to

895
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,158
current research comes up for public

896
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,840
debate

897
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,760
there is usually a joint statement

898
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,678
laying down the scientific opinion

899
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,600
signed by dozens or even hundreds of

900
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,480
researchers like for example from

901
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,320
scientists for future

902
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,679
then whenever you see a big number you

903
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,678
should look for context

904
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,520
when you read statements like we grow

905
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,679
sugar bead on an area of over four

906
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,679
hundred thousand hectare

907
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,679
you should immediately ask yourself who

908
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,399
is we is it germany

909
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,679
europe the world what is the time frame

910
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,080
is that per year

911
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,159
is that a lot how much is that compared

912
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,320
to other crops

913
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,720
context matters a lot and often big

914
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,200
numbers are used to impress you

915
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,279
in this case 400 000 hectare is the

916
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,039
yearly area that germany grows sugar

917
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,360
beet on

918
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:36,320
wheat for example is grown on over 3

919
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,479
million hectare per year in germany

920
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,960
context matters and so whenever you see

921
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,960
a number look for a frame of reference

922
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,559
if the article doesn't give you one

923
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,320
either go and look for yourself

924
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,399
or ignore the number for your decision

925
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,240
making based on the article

926
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,520
numbers only work with framing so be

927
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,600
aware of it

928
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,200
i want you to think briefly about how

929
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,279
you felt when i gave you that number of

930
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,200
400 000 hectare

931
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,360
chances are that you felt a sort of

932
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,840
feeling of unease because it's really

933
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,600
hard to imagine such a large number

934
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,360
an interesting exercise is to create

935
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,600
your own frame of reference

936
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,439
collect a couple of numbers like total

937
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,959
agricultural area of your country

938
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,760
the current spending budget of your

939
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,600
municipality the average yearly income

940
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,120
or the unemployment rate in relative and

941
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,799
absolute numbers

942
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,320
keep the list somewhere accessible and

943
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,399
use it whenever you come across a big

944
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,320
number that is hard to grasp

945
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,559
are a hundred thousand euro a lot of

946
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,879
money in context of public spending

947
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,879
how important are 5 000 jobs in context

948
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,559
of population and unemployment

949
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,640
such a list can diffuse the occasional

950
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,639
scary big number in news articles

951
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,000
and it can also help you to make your

952
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,480
point better

953
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,159
speaking of framing always be aware who

954
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,159
the sender of the information is

955
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,520
news outlets rarely have a specific

956
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,720
scientific agenda

957
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,799
but ngos do if shell the

958
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,320
oil company would provide a leaflet

959
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,158
where they cite scary numbers

960
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,918
and present research that they funded

961
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,279
that finds that oil drilling is actually

962
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,039
good for the environment

963
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,039
but they won't disclose who they work

964
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,480
with for the study we all would laugh at

965
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,919
that information

966
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,600
but if we read a leaflet from an

967
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,440
environmental ngo in munich

968
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,120
that is structurally identical but with

969
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,399
a narrative about glyphosate and beer

970
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,279
that fits our own perception of the

971
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,639
world

972
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,880
we are more likely to accept the

973
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,960
information in the leaflet in my opinion

974
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:23,039
both sources are problematic i would not

975
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,880
use any of them to build my own opinion

976
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,120
good journalists put links to the

977
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,440
sources in or under the article

978
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,199
and it is a good idea to check them

979
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,080
often however you have to look for the

980
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,080
paper yourself

981
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,600
based on hints in the text like author

982
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,678
names institutions and general topics

983
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,840
and then paywalls often block access to

984
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,919
the information that you're looking for

985
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,840
you can try pages like researchgate for

986
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,320
legal access to pdfs

987
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,000
many researchers also use scihub but as

988
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,439
the site provides illegal access to

989
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,720
publicly funded research

990
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,000
i won't recommend doing so when you have

991
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,919
the paper in front of you

992
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,039
you can either read it completely which

993
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,200
is kind of hard

994
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,399
or just read the abstract which might be

995
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,919
easier

996
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,959
the easiest is to look for science

997
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:09,039
journalism articles about the paper

998
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,880
twitter is actually great to find those

999
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,399
as many researchers are on twitter and

1000
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,360
like to share articles about their own

1001
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,959
research

1002
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,199
they also like to discuss research on

1003
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,799
twitter so if the story is controversial

1004
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,559
chances are you'll find some science

1005
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,320
accounts calling that out

1006
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,320
while twitter is terrible in many

1007
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,639
regards it is a great tool to engage

1008
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,320
with the scientific community

1009
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,720
you can also do a basic check up

1010
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,320
yourself where was the paper published

1011
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,000
and is it a known journal

1012
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,000
who are the people doing the research

1013
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,919
and what are their affiliations

1014
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,840
how did they do their experiment

1015
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,200
checking for controls and repetitions in

1016
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,039
the experiment is hard

1017
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,240
if you don't know the topic but if you

1018
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,360
do know the topic

1019
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,799
go for it in the end fact checking takes

1020
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,879
time and energy

1021
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,879
it's very likely that you won't do it

1022
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,880
very often but especially when something

1023
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,799
comes up that really interests you

1024
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,399
and you want to tell people about it you

1025
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,600
should do a basic fact check on the

1026
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,439
science

1027
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,879
the world would be a lot better if you'd

1028
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,519
only share information that you checked

1029
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,279
yourself for plausibility

1030
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,799
you can also help to reduce the need for

1031
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,799
rigorous fact checking

1032
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,559
simply do not spread any sign stories

1033
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,158
that seem too good to be true

1034
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,000
and that you didn't check yourself or

1035
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,840
find in a credible source

1036
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,840
misinformation and bad science reporting

1037
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,360
spread because we don't care enough

1038
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,840
and because they are very very

1039
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,840
attractive if we break that pattern we

1040
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,158
can give reliable scientific information

1041
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,879
the attention that it deserves but don't

1042
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,399
worry

1043
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,159
most of the science reporting you'll

1044
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,158
find online is actually pretty good

1045
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,159
there is no need to be extremely careful

1046
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,000
with every article you find

1047
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,080
still i think it is better to have a

1048
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,679
natural alertness to badly reported

1049
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,600
science than to trust just

1050
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,240
anything that is posted under a catchy

1051
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,279
headline there is no harm in double

1052
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,760
checking the facts

1053
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,519
because either you correct a mistake or

1054
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,519
you reinforce correct information in

1055
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,159
your mind

1056
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,080
so how do i assess whether a source that

1057
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,159
i like is actually good

1058
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,918
when i come across a new outlet i try to

1059
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,880
find some articles in an area that i

1060
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,440
know stuff about

1061
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,200
for me that's plant science i then read

1062
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,519
what they're writing about plants

1063
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,279
if that sounds plausible i am tempted to

1064
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,120
also trust when i write about things

1065
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,919
like physics or climate change

1066
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,239
where i have much less expertise this

1067
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,080
way i have my own personal list of good

1068
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,919
and not so good outlets

1069
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,000
if somebody on twitter links to an

1070
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,360
article from the not so good list

1071
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,960
i know that i have to take that

1072
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,519
information with a large quantity of

1073
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,679
sold

1074
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,600
and if i want to learn more i look for a

1075
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,039
different source to back up any claims i

1076
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,399
find

1077
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:37,840
it is tedious but so is science

1078
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,918
with a bit of practice you can

1079
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,439
internalize the skepticism and navigate

1080
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,880
science information with much more

1081
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,559
confidence

1082
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,640
i hope i could help you with that a

1083
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,240
little bit

1084
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,679
so that was my attempt to help you to

1085
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,519
understand science better

1086
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,440
i'd be glad if you'd leave me feedback

1087
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,399
or direct any of your questions towards

1088
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,799
me on twitter

1089
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,239
that's at scienceyoram there will be

1090
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,559
sources for the things that i talked

1091
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,880
about

1092
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,360
available somewhere around this video or

1093
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,640
on my website

1094
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,279
joram.schwartzman.de thank you for your

1095
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,840
attention

1096
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,840
goodbye

1097
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,918
de joan thank you for your talk very

1098
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,239
entertaining and

1099
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:21,279
uh informative as well as i might say um

1100
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:23,439
we have a few questions from uh

1101
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,879
yeah in at the congress it would be

1102
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,000
where's the signal angel i need my

1103
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,879
questions from the internet

1104
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,918
all of them are from the internet so um

1105
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:33,598
i would

1106
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:37,279
go through uh the questions and uh

1107
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,879
you can elaborate on some of the points

1108
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,879
from your talk

1109
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:45,918
so the first question very good

1110
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:47,839
the first question um is

1111
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:51,759
is there a difference between reviewed

1112
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,759
articles and meta studies

1113
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:57,440
to my knowledge there isn't

1114
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,560
really a categorical difference in terms

1115
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,599
of peer review

1116
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,078
meta studies so studies that integrate

1117
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,680
especially

1118
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,599
the medici in the medical field you find

1119
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,598
that often they integrate a lot of

1120
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,640
studies and then summarize the findings

1121
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,280
again and try to

1122
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,640
put them in context of one another which

1123
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,400
are extra

1124
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,400
incredibly useful studies for

1125
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,759
yeah for medical conclusion making

1126
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,000
because as i

1127
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,880
said in the talk uh it's often very hard

1128
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,960
to do for example dietary studies

1129
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,560
and you want to have large numbers and

1130
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,359
you get that by combining several

1131
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,680
studies together

1132
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,359
and usually these meta studies are also

1133
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,440
peer reviewed so

1134
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,560
instead of actually doing the research

1135
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,040
and

1136
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,799
going and doing whatever experiments you

1137
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,800
want to do on humans and

1138
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,280
you instead collect all of the evidence

1139
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,280
others did

1140
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,880
and then you integrate it again draw new

1141
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,280
conclusions from that and compare them

1142
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,680
and weigh them and say okay

1143
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,640
this study had these shortcomings but we

1144
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,118
can take

1145
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,640
this part from this study and put it in

1146
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,200
context with this part from his other

1147
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,720
study

1148
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,319
and because you make so much additional

1149
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,359
conclusion making on that

1150
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,040
um you then submit it again to a journal

1151
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,560
and it's again peer-reviewed and then

1152
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,960
other researchers look at it

1153
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,000
and say and yeah pretty much give their

1154
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,320
expertise on it and say

1155
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,079
whether or not it made sense what you

1156
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,680
concluded from all of these things so a

1157
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,200
meta study when it's published in a

1158
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,118
scientific journal

1159
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,399
is also peer-reviewed and also a very

1160
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,040
good credible source and i would even

1161
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,760
say uh

1162
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,440
often meta studies are the studies that

1163
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,440
you really want to look for

1164
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,720
if you have a very specific scientific

1165
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,640
question that you

1166
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,240
as a sort of non-expert want to have

1167
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,879
answered because

1168
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,439
very often the individual studies they

1169
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,599
are very

1170
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,880
focused on a specific detail of a bigger

1171
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,119
research question

1172
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,040
but if you want to know is i don't know

1173
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,520
dietary fiber very good for

1174
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,960
for me there's probably not a single

1175
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,800
study that will have the answer but

1176
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,040
there will be many studies that together

1177
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,640
point towards the answer and the meta

1178
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,640
study is a place where you can

1179
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:01,118
find that answer very good sounds like

1180
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,359
something to reinforce the research

1181
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,920
maybe a follow-up question or it is a

1182
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,319
follow-up question

1183
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,960
is there anything you can say in this

1184
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,480
regards about the

1185
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,880
reproducibility crisis in many fields

1186
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,760
such

1187
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,680
as medicine yeah that's a very good

1188
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,119
point i mean that's something that i

1189
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,520
didn't mention at all in the talk

1190
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,040
because for pretty much like complexity

1191
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,560
reasons because when you go into

1192
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,920
reproducibility

1193
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:30,960
um you run into all kinds of

1194
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,599
sort of complex additional problems um

1195
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,440
because yeah it is true that we often

1196
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,240
struggle with reproducing

1197
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,599
uh often i actually don't have the

1198
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,200
numbers how

1199
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,440
often we fail but there's this this

1200
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,960
reproducibility crisis that's often

1201
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,440
mentioned that is this idea

1202
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,400
that when researchers take a paper that

1203
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,240
has whatever

1204
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,520
they studied and then other researchers

1205
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,759
try to recreate the study

1206
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,440
and usually in the paper there's also a

1207
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,160
material and methods section that

1208
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,680
details

1209
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,440
all of the things that they did is

1210
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,480
pretty much the instructions of the

1211
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,760
experiment

1212
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,520
and the results of the experiment are

1213
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,119
both in the same paper usually and when

1214
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,240
they try to sort of re-cook

1215
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,599
the recipe that somebody else did there

1216
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,479
is a chance that they don't find the

1217
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,160
same thing

1218
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,760
and we see that more and more often

1219
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,640
especially with like complex research

1220
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,720
questions

1221
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,799
and that brings us to the idea that

1222
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,000
reproduction or reproducibility

1223
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,480
is an issue and that maybe we we can't

1224
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,640
trust

1225
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,440
science as much or we have to be more

1226
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,440
careful and

1227
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,960
it is true that we have to be more

1228
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,000
careful but i wouldn't go as far and to

1229
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,200
be like in general

1230
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,920
like sort of a distrustful of of

1231
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,279
research

1232
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,640
and that's why i'm also saying like in

1233
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,240
the medical field you always want to

1234
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,960
have multiple studies pointing at

1235
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,879
something

1236
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,400
um you will always want to have multiple

1237
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,520
lines of evidence

1238
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,320
because if one group finds something

1239
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,520
and another group can't find it uh like

1240
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,240
reproduce it

1241
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,759
uh you end up in a place where you can't

1242
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,959
really say

1243
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,720
did this work now like who did the

1244
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,200
mistake the first group or the second

1245
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,720
group

1246
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,560
because also when you're reproducing a

1247
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,319
study you can make mistakes or there can

1248
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,200
be factors that the initial research

1249
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,440
study

1250
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,200
didn't document in a way that it can be

1251
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,280
reproduced because they didn't

1252
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,799
care to write down the supply of some

1253
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,079
chemicals and the chemicals were

1254
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,320
very important for the success of the

1255
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,680
experiment and things like that happen

1256
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,400
and so you don't know when you just have

1257
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,319
the

1258
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,160
initial study in the reproduction study

1259
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,000
and they have different outcome

1260
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,399
but if you have then multiple studies

1261
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,000
that all look in a similar area

1262
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,400
and out of 10 studies eight or seven

1263
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,720
point

1264
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,599
to a certain direction you can then be

1265
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,598
more

1266
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,720
certain that this direction points

1267
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,720
towards the truth

1268
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,759
in science it's really hard to say like

1269
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,598
okay

1270
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,760
this is now the objective truth this is

1271
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,400
now we found now

1272
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,000
the definitive answer to to the question

1273
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,359
that we're looking at in the special

1274
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,960
especially in in the medical field um

1275
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,720
so yeah so that's a very long way of

1276
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,280
saying like it's it's complicated

1277
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,078
um reproduction or reproducibility

1278
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,119
studies they

1279
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:04,960
are very important um but it doesn't

1280
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,800
i wouldn't be too worried or too

1281
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,560
what's the word here like i i wouldn't

1282
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,040
be too worried that

1283
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,040
the the lack of reproducibility breaks

1284
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,319
the entire scientific method

1285
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,880
because it's usually more complex

1286
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,680
and more issues at hand than just a

1287
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,520
simple

1288
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,520
re-cooking of another person's study

1289
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:28,880
yeah speaking of uh of

1290
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,079
more publishing so this is a follow-up

1291
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,119
to the follow-up

1292
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:36,319
um uh the internet asks how can we deal

1293
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,800
with the publish of parish culture

1294
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,400
oh yeah if i knew that i would write

1295
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,880
very smart blog posts and

1296
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,079
trying to get convince people about that

1297
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,240
i think personally

1298
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,920
um we need to rethink the way we do the

1299
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,720
funding because that's in the end where

1300
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,400
it comes down to

1301
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,160
another issue that i really didn't go

1302
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,520
into much detail in the talk because

1303
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,040
also very complex

1304
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,960
so science funding is usually

1305
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,800
defined by a decision-making process at

1306
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,599
one point somebody decides who gets the

1307
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,920
money

1308
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,359
and to get the money they need a

1309
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,359
qualifier to decide

1310
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,640
like there is 10 research groups or 100

1311
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,078
research groups that

1312
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,920
said that right the ground and say like

1313
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,720
hey we need money because we want to do

1314
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,680
research

1315
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,879
and they have to figure out um or they

1316
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,480
have to

1317
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,000
decide like who gets it because they

1318
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,640
can't give money to everyone

1319
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,760
because we spend money in our in budgets

1320
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,200
on different things than just

1321
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,200
science so the next best thing that they

1322
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,879
came up with was the idea to use

1323
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,960
papers the number of papers that you

1324
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,359
have to

1325
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,720
sort of get the measurement or the

1326
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,598
quality of papers that you have

1327
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,118
to get a measurement of whether you are

1328
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,480
deserving of the money

1329
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,319
and you can see how how that's

1330
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,760
problematic it means that people who

1331
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,680
are early in their research career who

1332
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,720
don't have a lot of papers they have a

1333
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,319
lower

1334
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,319
chance of getting the money and that

1335
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,720
leads to this publisher parish idea

1336
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:56,640
that if you don't publish your results

1337
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,040
and if you don't publish them in a very

1338
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,799
well respected journal then the funding

1339
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,680
agencies won't give you money and so you

1340
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,920
perish and you

1341
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,960
can't really pursue your research career

1342
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,160
and it's it's

1343
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,960
really um a hard problem to solve

1344
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,960
because

1345
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,640
the decision about the funding is very

1346
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,880
much detached from

1347
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,000
the scientific this like the the

1348
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,680
scientific world from

1349
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,839
from academia there's like multiple

1350
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,839
levels of abstraction between

1351
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:24,160
the people who like in the end make the

1352
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:26,078
budgets and decide who gets the money

1353
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,359
and the people who are actually using

1354
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,800
the money

1355
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:33,839
um i would wish for funding agency to

1356
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,640
look lesser papers and um maybe come up

1357
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:39,200
with different

1358
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:42,480
qualifiers um maybe also something like

1359
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,040
uh general scientific practice

1360
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,079
uh maybe they could do audits of some

1361
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,800
sort of of

1362
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,680
of lap of labs i mean there's a ton of

1363
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,680
factors that

1364
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,200
influence good research that are not

1365
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,240
mentioned in papers

1366
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,560
like work ethics work culture

1367
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,319
how much teaching you do um which can be

1368
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,839
very important but uh it's sort of

1369
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:03,599
detrimental to get more funding because

1370
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,440
when you do teaching you don't do

1371
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,720
research and then you don't get papers

1372
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,599
and then you don't get money

1373
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,240
um so yeah i don't have a very good

1374
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,480
solution

1375
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,598
to to the question what we we can do i

1376
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,920
would like to see

1377
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,599
um more that more diverse funding also

1378
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,480
of smaller research groups i would like

1379
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,520
to see more

1380
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,480
funding for negative results which is

1381
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,000
another thing

1382
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,760
um that we don't really value

1383
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,280
so if you do an experiment and it

1384
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,640
doesn't work you can't publish it

1385
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,520
you don't get paper you don't get money

1386
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,799
and so on so there are many factors that

1387
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,560
need to change many things that we need

1388
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,960
to touch to actually get

1389
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:43,759
away from publish or perish

1390
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,800
yeah another question that is closely

1391
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,240
connected to that

1392
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:50,800
um is why are there so few stable jobs

1393
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,799
in science

1394
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,000
yeah that's the wizenshaft ciphertrex

1395
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:57,920
gazettes something that i forgot when we

1396
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,040
got it i think in the late 90s or early

1397
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,400
2000s

1398
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:06,160
um it's uh that's at least a

1399
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:09,280
very german specific answer

1400
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:12,799
that defined that this gazettes this law

1401
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,800
um put it into put it into law

1402
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,000
that you have a limited time span that

1403
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,480
you can work in research

1404
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,920
um you can only work in research for i

1405
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,319
think 12 years and there's

1406
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,760
some like footnotes and stuff around it

1407
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,880
but there is a fixed time limit that you

1408
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,119
can work in research on

1409
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,480
limited term contracts but your funding

1410
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,000
whenever you get research funding it's

1411
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,240
always for a limited time

1412
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,960
you always get research funding for

1413
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,640
three years six years if you're lucky

1414
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,000
so you never have permanent money in a

1415
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,920
research group um

1416
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,440
sometimes you have that in universities

1417
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,119
um but

1418
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,880
overall you don't have permanent money

1419
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,880
and so if you don't have permanent money

1420
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,280
you can't have permanent contracts

1421
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,119
and therefore there aren't really stable

1422
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,560
jobs and then with professorships or

1423
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,760
some group leader positions then it

1424
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,078
changes because

1425
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,920
um group leadership group leaders and

1426
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,280
professorships they are more easily

1427
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,040
planned and therefore

1428
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,720
in universities and research institutes

1429
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,160
they sort of make a long-term budget and

1430
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,040
say okay we will have

1431
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,839
15 research groups so we have money in

1432
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,200
the long term

1433
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:12,880
for 15 group leaders but whoever is

1434
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,640
hired underneath these group leaders

1435
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,400
this has much more fluctuation and is

1436
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,000
based on sort of short-term money

1437
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,440
and so there's no stable jobs there at

1438
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,079
least that's in in germany

1439
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,200
i know that for example in the uk and in

1440
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,880
france they have

1441
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,200
earlier permanent position jobs they

1442
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,920
have lecturers for example in the uk

1443
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,240
um where you can without being a full

1444
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,800
professor that has like its own

1445
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,560
backpack of stuff that has to be done

1446
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,680
you can already work at the university

1447
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,200
in the long term

1448
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,879
in a permanent contract so it's a very

1449
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,560
it's a problem that we see across the

1450
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,280
world but germany has its own

1451
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,319
very specific problems introduced here

1452
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,640
that make it very

1453
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:53,599
unattractive to stay long term in

1454
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,598
research in germany

1455
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:01,520
it's true i concur

1456
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:05,119
so the come coming to uh

1457
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:08,720
to to the people who uh who do science

1458
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:11,920
um mostly for fun and less for profit

1459
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,680
um this question is uh

1460
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,240
can you write and publish a paper

1461
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,480
without a formal degree in the sciences

1462
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,560
uh assuming the research efforts are

1463
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,520
sufficiently good

1464
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:25,040
um yes i think technically it is

1465
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,400
possible it comes with some problems

1466
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,200
like first of all it's not free

1467
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,000
first of all when you submit your paper

1468
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,200
to a journal

1469
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,200
you pay money for it

1470
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,359
i don't know exactly but it ranges i

1471
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,879
think the safe

1472
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:40,480
assumption is between a thousand and

1473
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,680
five thousand dollars

1474
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,160
depending on the journal where you

1475
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,000
submit to and then very often there's

1476
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,118
like some formal problems that

1477
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,440
i've been recently co-authoring a paper

1478
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,240
and i'm not actively doing research

1479
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,839
anymore i

1480
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,240
did something in my spare time um helped

1481
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,920
a

1482
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,439
friend of mine who's still doing

1483
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,720
research um

1484
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,240
with some like basic stuff but he was so

1485
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,160
nice to put me on the paper

1486
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,319
and then there's a form where it says

1487
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,078
like institute affiliation and i don't

1488
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,720
have an institute affiliation in that

1489
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,960
sense

1490
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,759
so as i'm just a middle author in this

1491
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,760
paper i

1492
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,599
i was published there or hopefully if it

1493
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,880
gets accepted i will be there as an

1494
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,359
independent researcher

1495
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,880
but it might be that a journal has their

1496
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,799
own internal rules where they say

1497
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,559
we only accept people from institutions

1498
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,079
so it's not really

1499
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,920
inherent in the scientific system that

1500
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,920
you have to be at an institution

1501
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,760
but there are these doors there are

1502
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,880
these these pathways that are locked

1503
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,880
because

1504
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,480
somebody has to put in a form somewhere

1505
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,680
that which what institution you

1506
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,599
affiliate with

1507
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,839
um and i know that some people who do

1508
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,920
like diy science so they do

1509
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:48,319
science outside of academia that they

1510
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,960
need to have in academia partners

1511
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,880
that help them with the publishing um

1512
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,359
and also to get access to certain things

1513
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,520
i mean

1514
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,960
uh in computer science you don't need

1515
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,000
specific chemicals but if you do

1516
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,079
anything like

1517
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,160
um chemical engineering or biology or

1518
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,720
anything uh often you only get

1519
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,078
access to the supplies when you are an

1520
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,959
academic institution

1521
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:11,280
so i know that many people have sort of

1522
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,079
these partnerships cooperations with

1523
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,960
academia that allow them to actually do

1524
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,839
the research

1525
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,520
and then publish it as well because

1526
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:21,040
otherwise if you're just doing it from

1527
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,839
your own bedroom

1528
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,480
there might be a lot of barriers in your

1529
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,240
way

1530
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,520
that might be very hard to overcome but

1531
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,959
i think if you're really really

1532
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,960
dedicated you can overcome them

1533
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:38,480
coming to the elephant in said bedroom

1534
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,359
um what can we do against the spread of

1535
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,800
false facts

1536
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:45,279
5g corona vaccines so um

1537
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,400
they are very they get a lot of likes

1538
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,920
and are spreads

1539
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:53,359
like like a disease themselves and

1540
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,760
it's very hard to to counter especially

1541
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,920
in

1542
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,599
personal encounters these these

1543
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,480
arguments because

1544
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,319
apparently a lot of people don't are not

1545
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,280
that familiar with the uh scientific

1546
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:06,319
method

1547
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,920
what's your take on that yeah it's it's

1548
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,279
it's difficult and i've read over

1549
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,200
over the years now many different

1550
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,559
approaches ranging from

1551
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,960
um not actually talking about facts

1552
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,200
because

1553
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,880
often somebody who has a very predefined

1554
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,720
opinion on something they know a lot of

1555
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,640
false facts that they have on their mind

1556
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,240
and you as somebody talking to them

1557
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,759
often don't have all of the correct

1558
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,479
facts in your mind i mean who runs

1559
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,880
around

1560
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,240
with like a bag full of climate facts

1561
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,559
and the back full of 5g

1562
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,359
facts and the backfall of vaccine facts

1563
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:36,800
all

1564
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:38,400
like in the same quantity and quality um

1565
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,160
as the stuff that somebody who read

1566
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,079
stuff on facebook has in their in their

1567
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:45,279
backpack in their sort of mental

1568
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,160
image of the world so um just arguing on

1569
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,280
the facts

1570
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:51,279
is very hard because people who

1571
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,720
follow these false ideas they often

1572
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,839
they're very quick in making turns and

1573
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,520
they like throw a thing

1574
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:57,040
at you one after the other and so it's

1575
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:59,119
really hard to just be like but actually

1576
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:02,160
debunking fact one and then

1577
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:04,800
debunking the next wrong fact um

1578
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,960
so i've i've seen a paper where people

1579
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,440
try to do this sort of on a

1580
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,000
argumentative standpoint they say um

1581
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,160
look you

1582
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
you're drawing false conclusions you say

1583
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,319
um because a

1584
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,200
therefore b but these two things aren't

1585
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:20,400
linked in a

1586
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,200
in a causal uh um causal way so you

1587
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,280
can't actually

1588
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,598
draw this conclusion and so sort of try

1589
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,640
to destroy their argument on a meta

1590
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,599
level instead on

1591
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:31,759
on the on the fact level but also that

1592
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:34,559
is difficult and usually people

1593
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,359
who are really devout followers of false

1594
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,760
facts

1595
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:40,480
they are also not followers of reason so

1596
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,720
any reason based argument

1597
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,480
will just not work for them because they

1598
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,598
will deny it

1599
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:50,800
i think what really helps is

1600
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:53,760
a lot of small scale action

1601
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,880
in terms of making scientific data so

1602
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,720
making science

1603
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,720
more accessible and i mean i'm a size

1604
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,919
communicator so i'm heavily biased i'm

1605
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,879
saying like we need more science

1606
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,480
communication

1607
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,040
we need more low-level science

1608
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,640
communication we need to have it freely

1609
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,839
accessible because all of the stuff that

1610
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,839
you read

1611
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:12,000
with the false facts this is all freely

1612
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,119
available on facebook and so on so we

1613
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,160
need to have

1614
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:19,280
a similar low level low entry level

1615
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:20,799
for the correct facts so for the real

1616
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,359
facts

1617
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,960
and this is also it's it's hard to do i

1618
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,480
mean in the in the science communication

1619
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,200
field there's also a lot of debate how

1620
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,520
we do that

1621
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,399
should we do that over more presence on

1622
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,839
social media

1623
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,839
should we um simplify more um or are we

1624
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,520
then actually

1625
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:39,520
oversimplifying like where is the

1626
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,880
balance how do we walk this line

1627
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:44,640
so there's a lot of discussion and still

1628
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,400
ongoing learning about that

1629
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,960
but i think in the end it's not what we

1630
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:52,800
need we need people to be able

1631
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:55,680
to just to to find correct facts

1632
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,280
just as easily and understandable as

1633
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:01,040
they find the fake

1634
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:03,760
fake news and and the facts like

1635
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,400
we need science to be communicated as

1636
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,760
clearly

1637
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,839
as a stupid cheryl on facebook um

1638
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,440
as an image that is like that i don't

1639
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,960
want to like read all of the wrong

1640
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:16,800
claims but something

1641
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:19,280
that says something very wrong but very

1642
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,880
persuasive we need to be as persuasive

1643
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,400
with the correct facts

1644
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,480
and i know that many people are doing

1645
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,000
that by nowadays especially on on places

1646
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,440
like instagram

1647
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,040
you find more and more people or tick

1648
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,079
tock you find more and more people doing

1649
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:34,480
very high quality low

1650
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,000
level and i mean that on a sort of

1651
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,280
jargon level not on a

1652
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,240
sort of intellectual level so very low

1653
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,359
barrier

1654
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,160
science communication and i think this

1655
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,720
helps

1656
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,759
a lot this helps more than very

1657
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:51,040
complicated

1658
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,640
uh sort of pages debunking false facts i

1659
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,000
mean we also need these we also need

1660
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,440
these as references

1661
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,920
but if we really want to combat the

1662
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,319
spread of fake news we need to

1663
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,640
just be as accessible with the with the

1664
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,640
truth

1665
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:10,319
a thing closely connected to that is uh

1666
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:12,240
how do we fine-tune our

1667
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:14,079
detectors since

1668
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,759
i guess people who are watching this

1669
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,599
talk have already

1670
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,920
started with the process of fine-tuning

1671
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:22,960
their

1672
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:25,040
detectors but when for example

1673
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,200
something very exciting and promising

1674
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:31,440
comes along as an example

1675
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:36,160
cast or something um how how do we

1676
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:38,559
go forward to uh to not uh

1677
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:41,359
to not be fooled by our own already

1678
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:45,040
tuned detectors and

1679
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:48,240
thoughts of conclusions i think i think

1680
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,359
a main part of this is practice just try

1681
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,118
to

1682
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,558
try to look for something that would

1683
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,800
break the story

1684
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,480
um just not for every story that you

1685
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,920
read that's that's a lot of work but

1686
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,520
from time to time pick a story where

1687
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,280
you're like oh this is very exciting

1688
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,960
and try to learn as much as you can

1689
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,280
about that one story

1690
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,319
and by doing that also learn about the

1691
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,839
process how you

1692
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:10,960
drew the conclusions and then compare

1693
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:14,000
your final image

1694
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:16,000
after you did all the research to

1695
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,599
the thing that you read in the beginning

1696
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,800
and see where

1697
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:22,160
there are things that are not coming

1698
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,800
together and where there are things that

1699
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,078
are the same

1700
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,680
and then based on that practice

1701
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,200
and i know that's that's a lot of work

1702
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,440
um

1703
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,399
so that that's sort of the the high

1704
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,040
impact

1705
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,520
way of doing that by just practicing and

1706
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:40,079
just actively

1707
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,559
doing the checkups but the other the

1708
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,359
other

1709
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:45,359
way you can do this is find people whose

1710
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:49,200
opinion you trust on topics

1711
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:50,720
and follow them follow them on podcasts

1712
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:54,799
on social media

1713
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:56,000
on youtube or wherever uh and

1714
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,119
like especially in the beginning when

1715
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,960
you don't know them well be very

1716
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,000
critical about them it's easy to fall

1717
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,160
into like a

1718
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,760
a sort of trap here um and following

1719
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,480
somebody who actually doesn't know their

1720
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,960
stuff

1721
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,799
but um there are some people i mean in

1722
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,640
this community here i am i'm not saying

1723
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:12,160
anything new if i say if you follow

1724
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,118
people like min correct like the torch

1725
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,160
incorrect

1726
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:18,000
um they are great uh for

1727
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,440
a very i actually can't really pin down

1728
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,720
which scientific area because in their

1729
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,160
podcast they're touching so many

1730
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,919
different things and they have a very

1731
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,558
high level understanding of how science

1732
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,680
works

1733
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:31,280
so places like this are a good start to

1734
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:33,359
um get a healthy dose of skepticism

1735
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,640
another rule of thumb that i can give is

1736
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:37,279
like usually

1737
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,160
stories are not as exciting when you get

1738
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,000
down to the

1739
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,240
to the nitty-gritty details like i'm a

1740
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,319
big fan of crispr for example

1741
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,279
but i don't believe that we can cure all

1742
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,440
diseases

1743
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,440
just now because we have crispr like

1744
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,000
there's very limited things we can do

1745
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,920
with it

1746
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,040
and we can do much more with it than we

1747
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,040
couldn't do than

1748
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,400
what we could do when we didn't have it

1749
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,200
but i'm not going around and thinking

1750
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,640
now we can

1751
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:02,640
create um life at will because we have

1752
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,000
crispo we can fight any disease at will

1753
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,240
because we have crispr

1754
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,440
um so that's a general good rule of

1755
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,640
thumb is just

1756
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:14,559
calm down look what's really in there

1757
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,960
and see how much um uh or tone it just

1758
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,000
down

1759
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,359
like 20 and then take that level of

1760
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,079
excitement with you instead of going

1761
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,160
around and being

1762
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,440
being scared overly excited about a new

1763
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,558
technology and you think

1764
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,200
that's been found because um we rarely

1765
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:30,720
do these

1766
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:32,720
massive jumps that we can

1767
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:35,598
that we need to to start to worry or get

1768
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:39,040
over-excited about something

1769
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:41,680
very good so the very last question

1770
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:44,079
um which tools did you use to create

1771
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:47,440
these nice drawings

1772
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:49,040
oh um a lot of people

1773
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,799
won't like me for saying this because

1774
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,839
this will sound like a product promo but

1775
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:54,319
there is

1776
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:55,279
um i use an ipad i use an ipad with a

1777
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,440
pencil and

1778
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,640
i used an app to draw the things on

1779
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,200
there um

1780
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,799
called affinity designer because that's

1781
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,598
that works very well then also across

1782
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:05,040
device so

1783
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,400
that's how i created all of the drawings

1784
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,359
then i put them all together in apple

1785
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,599
motion

1786
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:11,440
um and exported the whole thing in apple

1787
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:14,640
final cut so this is now

1788
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,680
the show like like a sales pitch

1789
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,879
for all of these products but i can say

1790
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,399
like for me they work very well but

1791
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,920
there's pretty much alternatives for

1792
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,359
everything along the way

1793
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,400
um if i'm i mean i can say because i'm

1794
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:26,400
also doing a lot of science

1795
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,920
communication with drawings for the

1796
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,440
plants and prepared project that i'm

1797
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,520
part of

1798
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,680
and i can say an ipad with a pencil and

1799
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:36,400
affinity designer gets you very far

1800
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:38,399
for high quality drawings with a very

1801
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,400
easy access because i'm i'm no way an

1802
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:44,559
artist i'm very bad at this stuff

1803
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:46,319
but i can hide all my shortcomings

1804
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:47,200
because i have an undo function in my

1805
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:49,520
ipad and because

1806
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,558
everything's in a vector drawing i can

1807
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,720
delete

1808
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:54,319
every stroke that i made even if i

1809
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,759
realized like an hour later that this

1810
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:57,440
should not be there i can like

1811
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,240
reposition it and delete it

1812
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,680
so vector files and the pencil and an

1813
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,680
undo function

1814
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:06,240
were my best friends in the creating of

1815
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,240
this video

1816
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,559
very good there you are thank you very

1817
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:13,520
much for your talk and

1818
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:15,520
your very extensive q a i think a lot of

1819
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:18,079
people are very happy with your work and

1820
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,960
uh are you actually saying in the past

1821
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:21,599
that you should

1822
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,559
continue to communicate science to the

1823
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:25,680
public

1824
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:27,440
that's very good because that's my job

1825
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,720
it's good that the people thank you very

1826
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,680
much

1827
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,640
so a round of applause and some very

1828
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:36,558
final

1829
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:39,118
announcements for this session

1830
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,160
um there will be the herod news show in

1831
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:43,680
the break

1832
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:46,720
so say stay tuned for that and

1833
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:49,279
um i would say if there are no

1834
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,480
further no we don't have any more time

1835
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,200
sadly but

1836
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,520
i guess people know how to connect to

1837
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,640
you

1838
00:58:53,520 --> 00:59:05,839
and contact the uram if you want to know

1839
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:05,839
anything more

1840
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:33,839
wow
