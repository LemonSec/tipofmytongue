harvard he's doing so many things and

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,439
he's

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:36,399
fighting for our digital rights

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:41,360
and i'm very happy to say hi welcome

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,360
thank you um

yeah and uh

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,160
spot the surveillance is the topic um

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,120
we will see

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,000
what we haven't seen before and i'm very

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,839
happy

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,799
that you're here and could absol

19
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:07,119
please let us know what's up thank you

20
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,119
thank you

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,960
hello everybody my name is kurt opsahl i

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,320
am the deputy executive director and

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,600
general counsel of the electronic

24
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,960
frontier foundation

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,360
i'm here to talk to you about observing

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,439
police surveillance at protests

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,720
so why do we want to observe police at

28
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,279
protests

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,640
well because protests are political

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,920
expression

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,360
as the council of europe put it the

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,720
right of individuals to gather with

33
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,600
other people and make their collective

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,520
voice heard

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,520
is fundamental to a properly functioning

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,360
democracy and this is a right which is

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,240
protected by the european convention on

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,720
human rights

39
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,520
and other international rights treaties

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,079
but

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,679
surveillance can chill that right so

42
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,199
knowing what technologies are in use

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,720
can help you understand the threats to

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,040
your privacy and security

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,960
as well as provide tools to advocate for

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,560
limits on police user surveillance

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,079
surveillance that may chill people's

48
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,520
right to express themselves on these

49
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,360
public issues

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,840
just as analog surveillance historically

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,000
has been used as a tool for oppression

52
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,360
nowadays policymakers and the public

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,200
have to understand

54
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,639
that the threat posed by emerging

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,959
technologies

56
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,480
is a danger to human rights and they

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,120
need to understand this to successfully

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,200
defend

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,560
human rights in the dictionary so

60
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,399
journalists who are reporting on

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,000
protests and police action

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,560
should know the surveillance that is in

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,760
use activists who are advocating for

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,920
limitations

65
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,599
on police use or surveillance need to

66
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,200
know what surveillance is being used to

67
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,119
effectively advocate

68
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,040
and legal observers may need to document

69
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,200
the use of surveillance and protests

70
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,799
in order to challenge the police actions

71
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,399
at the protest or challenge police

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,120
policies that are being used after the

73
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,920
protest

74
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,040
with the footage they've obtained so

75
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,000
what do we go up today

76
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,079
we're going to provide a lot of

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,760
information about various types of

78
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,319
surveillance technologies in use by

79
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,799
police

80
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,920
around the world uh we're telling you

81
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,040
where to look

82
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,399
what the appearance is how it works what

83
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,400
kind of data they collect

84
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,760
and how they're used by police and at

85
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,360
the end we'll have a few

86
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,720
other resources available for those who

87
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,360
want to dive a little bit deeper

88
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,159
so police surveillance technology is

89
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,879
everywhere

90
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,920
it's on the police themselves on their

91
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,959
vehicles

92
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,679
on the roadways it could be above you in

93
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,159
the air

94
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,840
uh surrounding you in the environment

95
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,920
can be a lot of different places and you

96
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,239
need to know where to look

97
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,679
on police officers themselves you'll

98
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,200
often find in the form of either

99
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,040
body-worn cameras

100
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,958
or additional devices that they're using

101
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,798
which are basically mobile biometric

102
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,599
sensors

103
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,440
body one cameras are technology that's

104
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,879
uh come out and become more popular over

105
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,879
the last decade or so

106
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,000
originally was something that was being

107
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,518
used

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,280
as a way to provide police

109
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,280
accountability that

110
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,040
uh give a record of their interactions

111
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,879
with the public and maybe for example

112
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,599
could be used to show police brutality

113
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,599
or maybe deter

114
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,439
police brutality but there are two-way

115
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,879
streets devices are often used to

116
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,799
surveil protesters

117
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,000
and the footage may later be used to

118
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,280
support arrests

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,480
and charges for example

120
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,400
we use this npr story where after a

121
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,840
rally

122
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,519
weeks later the police went

123
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,320
identified people through body cam

124
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,160
footage and brought action against them

125
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,918
uh for obstructing the railway which is

126
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,440
part of the civil disobedience of the

127
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,758
protest

128
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,160
based on finding them on the body camera

129
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,080
footage

130
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,199
they can put you know a variety of

131
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,120
places so

132
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,560
uh if you're looking for body worn

133
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,320
cameras you gotta look in different

134
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,040
places to see where they might be

135
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,960
so a couple places they might see them

136
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,479
on the head a head mounted camera

137
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,919
so it might be on your glasses on the

138
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:46,800
side could be a lens right in the center

139
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,198
uh the center one is pretty hard to find

140
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,199
but

141
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,280
uh the ones on the side or it might be

142
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,240
part of the glasses or maybe a helmet

143
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,479
they're wearing

144
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,240
are generally pretty obvious these ones

145
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,240
they're not particularly common but they

146
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,880
do they do happen

147
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,320
um shoulder mounted cameras also a

148
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,159
little bit less common

149
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,800
but uh they have an interesting feature

150
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,320
in this case we're using the warrior 360

151
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,080
from blue light innovations as an

152
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,520
example and it is a

153
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,560
dome camera that looks all directions

154
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,000
uh so 360 degrees off of the officer's

155
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,560
left shoulder

156
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,039
well most cameras like a front-facing

157
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,840
camera

158
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:27,759
will capture only 180 degrees

159
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,198
chest mounted cameras are the most

160
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,600
common and these are being used

161
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,840
very very widely uh we give some

162
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,680
examples here from from amsterdam

163
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,239
madelberg and from west midlands police

164
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,600
uh

165
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,120
in the uh eu or

166
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,720
soon maybe not in eu for a case of

167
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,800
britain

168
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,960
and there are several known types uh

169
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,000
axon wolfcom and watchguard are very

170
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,039
common

171
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,520
uh they operate in similar manners uh

172
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,759
though

173
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,758
uh with some differences and

174
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,199
you can uh take a look at some of the

175
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,960
examples that are available on those

176
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,319
those companies web pages where they

177
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,880
will explain the products they have on

178
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,160
offer

179
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,400
and see what matches up for your

180
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,919
jurisdiction or you can also look in

181
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,758
for news articles oftentimes there's a

182
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,240
news article about when the

183
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,080
first policy to bring body worn cameras

184
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,000
is introduced in a particular police uh

185
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,120
there's also smartphone based cameras

186
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,680
and these are kind of the

187
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,960
the low end uh it's basically just an

188
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,039
android cell phone

189
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,719
using its internal camera with an app

190
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,479
that does recording

191
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,639
placed in a pocket so the camera is a

192
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,960
little bit above the uh the cloth

193
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,120
and can see forward uh but it's also a

194
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,479
very subtle technique it could be easily

195
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,560
confused if you weren't looking

196
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,680
with someone just storing their phone in

197
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,680
their pocket

198
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,720
it also might be clipped somewhere on

199
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,199
their uniform

200
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,560
but if you see anything where the camera

201
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,240
is facing outward

202
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,919
and it's attached to the officer there's

203
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,880
a good chance that that is a body worn

204
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,880
camera at least that app is in play

205
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,639
and last on the bodyboard cameras we'll

206
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,080
talk about the semi-obscure camera so

207
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,960
this is an example from a company called

208
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,479
body worn

209
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,239
sorry the product called body worn

210
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,159
company called utility

211
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,240
and it is partially concealed it

212
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,440
basically looks like a button

213
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,199
on someone's uh you know more uniform

214
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,599
that if you're not looking closely you

215
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,479
might not notice but if you see as you

216
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,240
led you know it appears where you would

217
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,680
expect actually not to have a button

218
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,800
it's slightly larger it looks a little

219
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,840
bit different it looks like a camera if

220
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,120
you look up closely

221
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,799
but if you're looking at a distance and

222
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,599
not particularly paying attention you

223
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,120
might not

224
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,680
see it at all in addition to body worn

225
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,160
cameras

226
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,080
police will often use uh mobile

227
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,120
biometric devices

228
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,159
so these can be handheld scanners uh it

229
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,520
could be

230
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,800
a tablet or a camera phone

231
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,159
um and in some cases it just is a camera

232
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,639
which just has a particular app on it um

233
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,440
but we'll see that uh you can sometimes

234
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,520
tell

235
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,520
whether they're using a phone or whether

236
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,878
using as a biometric scanner

237
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,799
by the body language so for example

238
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,080
if the police officer is holding up the

239
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,639
phone

240
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,080
trying to capture someone's face that is

241
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,720
most likely because they

242
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,878
have a capturing a photo and they may be

243
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,440
connecting that to a facial recognition

244
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,440
application

245
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,520
and you also will see mobile

246
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,680
fingerprinting

247
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,639
so uh here's an example in the united

248
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,560
kingdom

249
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,240
they have an app on the officer's phone

250
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,960
combined with a fingerprint

251
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,399
scanning device and it takes the

252
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,519
people's fingerprints and checks them

253
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,000
against some databases

254
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,200
one is a database of everyone the police

255
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,120
have detained both

256
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,440
putting it into the database and then

257
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,679
checking against it for for new people

258
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,560
and the other one is a database for uh

259
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,000
immigration

260
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,719
uh to collect it at the border when

261
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,120
someone comes into the uk

262
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,640
and this allows the the police to do a

263
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,839
very rapid check

264
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,600
of their records on somebody in the

265
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,360
field

266
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,360
some of these devices are multi-modal

267
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,399
they'll do both they'll be able to do

268
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,240
do fingerprints and take photos for

269
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,720
facial recognition

270
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,920
uh this here is the dataworks plus

271
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,519
evolution

272
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,399
does both um

273
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,200
and that can be you know convenient for

274
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,279
the officers

275
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,080
uh but it's a little bit more dangerous

276
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,600
to some of the ways

277
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,080
and some of the body warm cameras in

278
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,279
this example wolfcom

279
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,560
has a biometric capability built in

280
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,480
facial recognition so it can uh

281
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,000
use its regular camera functions and of

282
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
course all of them if they take the

283
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,480
picture

284
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,240
that picture could be uploaded to a

285
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,120
database and facial recognition will be

286
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,200
done later

287
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,760
but this one is designed to streamline

288
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,600
that process

289
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,080
so i'll take a moment as i decide to

290
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,560
talk about facial recognition in europe

291
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,800
uh per algorithm watch the organization

292
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,479
says that there are at least 11 police

293
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,319
agencies in europe who use facial

294
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,440
recognition

295
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,000
as shown on the map here the uk court of

296
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,399
appeal

297
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,240
found that automatic facial recognition

298
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,200
technology used by the south wales

299
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,720
police

300
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,880
was not lawful however elsewhere in the

301
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,839
uk they are still using it

302
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,560
the metropolitan police is doing in

303
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,760
london

304
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,760
is doing a live facial recognition

305
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,120
throughout the city of london and it

306
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,720
contends that the situation is

307
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,640
distinguishable from south wales

308
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,360
so now that doesn't doesn't apply to

309
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,800
them we'll see how that turns out

310
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,560
there's also been some pressure on the

311
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,719
european uh commission

312
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,040
to put a ban in place or put

313
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,680
restrictions on facial recognition

314
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,399
and uh in september there was a quote

315
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,319
from

316
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,839
the commissioners saying that they were

317
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,200
considering whether we need additional

318
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,760
safeguards or whether we need to go

319
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,240
further and not allow facial recognition

320
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,600
in certain cases in certain areas or

321
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,880
even temporarily

322
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,120
which is not a particularly strong

323
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,399
statement but it is a at least they are

324
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,920
considering the idea

325
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,240
and this is something that one can

326
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,079
advocate for in the united states

327
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,920
a number of jurisdictions at the local

328
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,680
levels uh cities

329
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,599
have put restrictions on their police

330
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,399
departments so they cannot use facial

331
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,120
recognition

332
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,680
it's a growing movement and while a

333
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,720
national

334
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,239
or international law that would limit

335
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,680
police use of facial recognition would

336
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,360
be the best for civil liberties

337
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,800
you can also start at your local level

338
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,560
all right once we move beyond the police

339
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,439
officers results where else

340
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,079
vehicles and roadways and this can come

341
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,959
up

342
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,839
for the vehicles roadways both adjacent

343
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,399
to the protests

344
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,079
and within the protests themselves so

345
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,480
adjacent to the protests

346
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,839
is looking at the exits and entrances to

347
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,399
the protest areas

348
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,000
and they may use existing alpr or place

349
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,079
new alpr

350
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,760
uh or ampr automated number plate

351
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,880
research called alpr in the united

352
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,040
states

353
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,480
and these are cameras generally we

354
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,079
pointed towards the roadway to where

355
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,040
cars will be

356
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,800
that are designed to uh take a picture

357
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,639
determine what the license plate uh

358
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,279
number plate is

359
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,920
optical character resolution they will

360
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,320
eventually

361
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,959
recognize them eventually be able to see

362
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,639
what it is

363
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,000
check the database and find out who's

364
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,800
registered for that

365
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,480
car and it can be uploaded to a central

366
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,680
server for place to search

367
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,480
can add vehicles to a watch list it is a

368
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,719
very powerful tool because many people

369
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,920
are using cars to get to and from

370
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,079
protests

371
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,279
uh and uh even if they're they're going

372
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,719
in in a group

373
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,120
at least one member of the group would

374
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,560
have had the car

375
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,000
and it has been used to go after someone

376
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,479
after a protest so in this case

377
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,079
it was from a number of years back but a

378
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,560
citizen in the uk

379
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,439
uh went to a protest and was later

380
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,599
pulled over

381
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,480
because they had captured the license

382
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,200
plate

383
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,480
while at the protest added to a database

384
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,480
and then use that to pull them up

385
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,599
so if there is a protest the police

386
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,639
might come in and use a portable

387
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,720
number plate reader uh so here's some

388
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,760
some examples what they might look like

389
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,839
they're either on a tripod or on a

390
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,439
trailer uh and they can set these up

391
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,680
basically anywhere

392
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,880
it would often be used at the entrance

393
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,279
or exit to the

394
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,320
zone in which the protest is expected to

395
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,320
see who's coming in

396
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,160
or who's coming out uh during the

397
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,839
protest time period

398
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:29,360
and trying to sort of capture the crowd

399
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,440
through their license plates it also

400
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,880
is now becoming more and more common on

401
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,800
police cars

402
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,079
uh you can see a couple examples we have

403
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,560
here uh

404
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,959
one it shows it uh rather obvious in the

405
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:45,199
top one that's a uk police car

406
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:47,599
and uh you can see the camera sticks out

407
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,880
fairly obvious that they have a camera

408
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,120
on the light bar

409
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,800
the lower one from the french police

410
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,760
less obvious it looks like an ordinary

411
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,359
light bar

412
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,120
uh you might be able to tell that it's a

413
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,680
little bit different

414
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,160
than some other ones because it has sort

415
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,319
of a

416
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,839
funny thing in the center but it's a

417
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,079
pretty subtle approach

418
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,680
um so there's all kinds they might also

419
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,319
be mounted on the hood or the trunk

420
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,959
and it may be more or less obvious but

421
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,199
take a look

422
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,800
at phones and also take a look at what

423
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,279
the police cars behavior

424
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,719
if they are driving for example slowly

425
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,320
down the street next to a whole bunch of

426
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,320
parked cars

427
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,760
it may be that they are doing gridding

428
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,760
practice known as gridding

429
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,680
where they are looking for capturing

430
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,920
every parked car's

431
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,199
license plate in a particular zone

432
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,639
you're trying to run

433
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:37,359
slow and steady in order to do that

434
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,480
uh and then there are the fixed number

435
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,880
plate readers

436
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,079
uh these are often at traffic lights and

437
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,680
intersections

438
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,800
on the highways uh any sort of

439
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,439
high-speed uh uh toll road will have

440
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,120
them

441
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,040
they also are you know they're used for

442
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,480
other purposes like to uh

443
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,439
uh establish uh fines uh to

444
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,800
check uh border crossings they are very

445
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,440
common fixtures on

446
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,599
on roadways so a protest happens in the

447
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,279
zone that already has them

448
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,199
the police will be able to access that

449
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:13,279
information and know who

450
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,279
entered or exited that area around

451
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,040
all right and then within the protest

452
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,399
itself

453
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,160
there may be adding additional

454
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,440
surveillance capacities

455
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,760
so in this example we have a

456
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,680
the santa fe police department uh knew

457
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,040
about a protest that was protesting

458
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,479
a uh statue uh and uh

459
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,880
there was a question by me so people

460
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,399
would take action and remove the statue

461
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,240
so in order to capture that through

462
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,040
surveillance they place this

463
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,959
trailer which has a number of camera and

464
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,519
audio capabilities

465
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,560
uh and just rolled it in right next to

466
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,759
the statue

467
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,959
to capture the protest action

468
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,000
and these cameras can come in a variety

469
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,040
of forms

470
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,240
uh in this case look at the watch towers

471
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,079
personal control cameras can be in

472
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,600
personnel controlling the cameras can be

473
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,758
in the watchtower

474
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,720
or they can be operating remotely as you

475
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,720
can see

476
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,120
uh you know they are using a scissor

477
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,440
jack to to raise it above that van

478
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,199
uh the other one is a uh an assembly

479
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,000
it's not easy for someone to get in and

480
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,079
out of there

481
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,120
so it may have a person but somewhat

482
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,040
inconvenient to

483
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,880
to actually have a person inside these

484
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,680
watchtowers but it's much more

485
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,279
convenient

486
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,279
to use their built-in surveillance

487
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,199
capabilities and remotely

488
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,560
uh observe the area around the

489
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,839
watchtower with those cameras

490
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,920
and then there are also pure

491
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,279
surveillance units uh there's this

492
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,479
example here

493
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:46,320
uh showing uh uh

494
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,880
four cameras uh raised pole

495
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,279
and just adding surveillance capability

496
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,240
basically to anywhere

497
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,240
and some of the uh

498
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,680
some of them are much more complex

499
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,800
thermal imaging cameras

500
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,559
uh thermal imaging uh often comes from

501
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,959
the leading company is fleur

502
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,480
that stands for forward-looking infrared

503
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,919
floor system makes a lot of these

504
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,520
devices and makes them available to

505
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,919
police departments

506
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,679
thermal imaging cameras allow the police

507
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,079
to be able to conduct surveillance

508
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,919
after dark where the lighting is poor

509
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,119
where they might not be able to

510
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,880
identify individuals very easily instead

511
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:28,000
they can use their heat signature

512
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,799
and be able to continue to monitor the

513
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,400
protest

514
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,840
when the lighting conditions are less

515
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,200
and a lot of things on protests will

516
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,639
happen at night

517
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,320
candlelight vigil is very commonplace so

518
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,559
police will be looking to thermal

519
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,879
imaging to make sure that they have

520
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,120
strong surveillance capabilities after

521
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,039
dock

522
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,120
another thing you might see around a

523
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,600
protest is an emergency command

524
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,959
vehicle uh these are often massive bus

525
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,639
sized vehicles

526
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,840
uh and they do have some surveillance

527
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,880
capabilities they might have some

528
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,720
cameras

529
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,160
uh but more often they are command

530
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,600
commanded control

531
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,080
so they are the places where somebody

532
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,600
would be receiving footage from cameras

533
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,080
and operating cameras remotely uh

534
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,520
making communications with other people

535
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,879
in the field

536
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,799
uh though they also may have some

537
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,880
built-in capabilities

538
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,039
and they may provide the focal point

539
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,880
where a local connection they're getting

540
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,720
information from local devices

541
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,440
and then they have the uplink in the

542
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,440
command center

543
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,200
one thing i wanted to point out is a

544
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,000
common misconception or something that

545
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,679
comes up

546
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,520
a lot when people are concerned about

547
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,720
police surveillance is they'll see an

548
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:39,360
unmarked vehicle a van with no windows

549
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,400
uh it may even have some antennas or

550
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,959
satellites

551
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,440
and while that is possibly an undercover

552
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,360
police

553
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,760
vehicle uh you shouldn't assume that

554
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,799
that vehicle belongs to law enforcement

555
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,120
uh that could very easily be a

556
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,918
news media vehicle news media also goes

557
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,080
to protests

558
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,120
they also have satellite uplinks and

559
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,520
antennas

560
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,479
uh they look very similar and in some

561
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,799
cases

562
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,400
the media has a security situation there

563
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,320
they're worried that there may be

564
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,000
theft of equipment and they have

565
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,320
unmarked vans

566
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,440
so uh is worth noting that there is an

567
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,439
unmarked vehicle

568
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,880
but you shouldn't necessarily assume

569
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,559
that it is a police unmarked vehicle

570
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,720
also sometimes people see especially

571
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,760
they see some antennas or satellite dish

572
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,080
on a vehicle

573
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,440
then maybe that's where a stingray is

574
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,879
this is a misconception

575
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,640
stingrays are pretty small

576
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,000
and they don't require an external

577
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,600
antenna to operate

578
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,799
you could put a stingray inside a trunk

579
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,439
of a car

580
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,320
uh you know maybe about briefcase sized

581
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,960
so it would be

582
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,918
unlikely that uh if you're going to use

583
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,840
a

584
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,120
stingray or shell side simulator or mc

585
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,559
catcher

586
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,639
that you wouldn't want to put it in a

587
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,200
vehicle you don't need to put in a

588
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,760
vehicle

589
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,440
that has its own antenna there have been

590
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,799
not very much documentation these

591
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,919
technologies have been used in the u.s

592
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,960
domestic

593
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,120
protests uh they have been used

594
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,120
we know in some protests in more

595
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,678
authoritarian countries

596
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,399
uh so it's unclear how often they will

597
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,919
be

598
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,200
are being used and they are very

599
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,760
dangerous things simpler

600
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,080
so in mse catcher it is able to

601
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,080
determine what cell phones are nearby

602
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,120
uh get a unique identifier with that

603
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,039
cell phone

604
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,399
and many cases be able to use that

605
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,879
information to determine what

606
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,880
individual's president approaches and

607
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,000
that information has been used after

608
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,799
some

609
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,480
protests in ukraine for example to send

610
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,960
a text message to people telling them

611
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,280
that you know

612
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,799
we're on to you we know you were there

613
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,120
which could be very intimidating

614
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,799
to individuals but the challenges if

615
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,879
you're trying to observe

616
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,639
police surveillance and every test it is

617
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,159
hard for you to observe it because they

618
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,240
are often hidden

619
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,600
uh you may be able to find out more

620
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,360
information later through

621
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,280
investigative journalism or public

622
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,039
record requests or news reports

623
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,200
if somebody is prosecuted using that

624
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,280
information it may become obvious

625
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,760
but it's difficult to see at the protest

626
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,760
itself

627
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:14,159
so next category look it up in the sky

628
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,440
there are lots of forms of aerial

629
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,000
surveillance

630
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,960
enforcement agency will surveil protests

631
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,280
from above

632
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,159
using traditional aircraft with onboard

633
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,320
pilots

634
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,280
and as well as smaller remotely operated

635
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,000
aerial systems

636
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,520
drones law enforcement may also use

637
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,320
these area vehicles to communicate with

638
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,559
the crowd

639
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,080
to use the loudspeakers to send a

640
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,840
message to the crowd order them to

641
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,720
disperse

642
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,480
and we've seen this actually drones with

643
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,120
loudspeakers being used by the german

644
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,360
police

645
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,239
in order to tell people to stay apart

646
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,840
corona

647
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,480
that same technology can be used for

648
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,480
protests

649
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,280
and these planes and drones will often

650
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,039
be equipped with high definition cameras

651
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,960
capable of either an extremely wide

652
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,520
angle to get the whole scene

653
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,159
or an extreme zoom where they might be

654
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,039
able to zoom out on a particular person

655
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,400
a particular license plate and then use

656
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,520
that data later

657
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,880
partnering that the aircraft with

658
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,039
license plate recognition face

659
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,000
recognition video analytics

660
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,480
and even a cell site simulator inside

661
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,559
the aircraft

662
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,400
and this you know we know this has

663
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:27,678
happened in a recent uh

664
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:30,400
protest in texas a texas police drone

665
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,559
uh caught some footage of a of a

666
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,080
protester allegedly throwing a water

667
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,678
bottle

668
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,720
they took that video they took the

669
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,880
picture put it out offered a cash reward

670
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,840
and anonymous temperature turned the the

671
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,200
kid in

672
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,039
and protest uh uh was prosecuted

673
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,720
so police are definitely using these

674
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,640
things to gather information

675
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,720
at protests so a common uh method for

676
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,520
actually larger police departments

677
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,400
uh is fixed-wing aircraft for smaller

678
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,080
ones they may use

679
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,640
private contractors to provide these

680
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,439
fixed-wing craft so this is an example

681
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,520
of the kind of plane used by a company

682
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,120
called persistent surveillance systems

683
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,960
it rents out a plan like this without

684
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,320
this exact one you look up that tail

685
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,880
number it's going to be to a different

686
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,879
company

687
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,080
but the same model of planet assessed by

688
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,640
207

689
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,120
and these will circle around the protest

690
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,799
uh

691
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,559
using their cameras to observe

692
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,720
protesters below

693
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,840
an advantage of planes is they can often

694
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,120
circle for

695
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,000
uh quite a long time and provide a wide

696
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,120
view of the

697
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,520
of the area also

698
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,600
helicopters helicopters will often be

699
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,918
seen hovering over a protest

700
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,520
uh they are a little bit easier to

701
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,480
maneuver and be able to go backwards and

702
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,360
forwards

703
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,320
over the protest uh and are used by by

704
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,760
police to

705
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,439
uh continually observe uh and

706
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,960
we use two examples here one of them

707
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,720
from the oakland police department the

708
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,679
other one from the ryan land police

709
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,960
department

710
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:01,200
in both cases they have a fleur attached

711
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,159
to the helicopter a forward-looking

712
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,760
infrared

713
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,760
that would allow them in addition to

714
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,320
regular cable capabilities

715
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,240
to use thermal imaging to follow someone

716
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,559
uh out of protest or follow what's going

717
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,799
on

718
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:16,559
after dark um you can also

719
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,559
see that some helicopters will have

720
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,678
spotlights so that they can

721
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:25,840
uh signal to officers on the ground

722
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,840
who to follow who to pay attention to

723
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,918
another thing for both fixed wing and

724
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,159
helicopters

725
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,760
you look for the tail number in most

726
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,480
jurisdictions they're required to have

727
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,240
the tail number

728
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,440
visible and then you can look up that

729
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,520
tail number on services like flightaware

730
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,720
and be able to uh find out further

731
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,080
information about

732
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,480
what that plane has been doing what the

733
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,960
helicopter has been doing as well as the

734
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,960
ownership

735
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,320
finally drones drones are becoming

736
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,840
a very common place because they're

737
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,480
getting cheaper all the time

738
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,000
and have any additional capacities

739
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,919
drones are also known as unmanned

740
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,200
aerial vehicles uavs uas unmanned aerial

741
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,600
systems

742
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,400
uh and a lot of police departments are

743
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,559
getting them

744
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,039
for their capabilities using most

745
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,639
commonly a quad rotor

746
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,720
and they can be controlled by remote

747
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,760
control have a

748
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,240
camera built into this and be useful for

749
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,919
getting

750
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,919
above the scene view um

751
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,120
so one way to spot it well first of all

752
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,799
just listen to it they make kind of a

753
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,279
distinctive noise

754
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,360
uh sometimes they'll be marked as police

755
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:36,880
uh you can also look for the pilots

756
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,399
operating nearby so oftentimes a

757
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,840
you can sell a drug file first of all

758
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
sometimes they're they're labeled like

759
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,240
in the

760
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,640
upper left there it says police drone

761
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,880
operator pretty easy to identify

762
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,320
uh other times they might have like

763
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,279
drone uav

764
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,678
aviation unit on their uniform on a

765
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,360
nearby police vehicle

766
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,039
the other thing is that if you identify

767
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,918
a drone

768
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,440
uh they're often within line of sight is

769
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,159
going to be the operator so once you see

770
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,159
the drone

771
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,679
look around and see if someone has the

772
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,360
wrong controls in their hand

773
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,200
is looking up at the drone you can

774
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,879
probably identify the operator

775
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,880
and go look for information they might

776
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,039
have on their uniform

777
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,279
about who is operating that particular

778
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,360
drone

779
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,640
but also keep in mind both for drones

780
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,120
and other aircraft

781
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,640
that is not necessarily the police uh

782
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
journalists and activists will often

783
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,159
file

784
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,120
fly drones uh over protests news

785
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,640
helicopters

786
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,840
for our large protests are going to be

787
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,760
more common than police helicopters

788
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,559
and many times they are labeled a

789
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,559
picture of the bbc news copter

790
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,678
uh but this means that just as you see a

791
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,639
helicopter

792
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,919
that has both the camera uh and is

793
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,880
flying over the uh

794
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:52,000
protest that does not necessarily mean

795
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,159
that it's a police

796
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,679
also another technology which is

797
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,120
actually not not very commonplace

798
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,320
outside of uh

799
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,158
protests in uh war zones uh but the

800
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,678
drone killer technology which is

801
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,360
basically a ray gun

802
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,159
that knocks drones out of the sky

803
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,279
sending uh radio signals to

804
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:14,320
uh interfere with the drones operation

805
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,400
and cause them to fall and crash these

806
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,439
have been used in

807
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,799
iraq and afghanistan and the technology

808
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,720
uh could be certainly used

809
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,918
but we really haven't seen it used more

810
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,640
frequently do you want to tell you about

811
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,840
it because

812
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,760
oh my god drone killers

813
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,959
all right last place to look for for

814
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,080
police technology

815
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,559
in the environment around you uh

816
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,439
there will be in many places camera

817
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,960
networks

818
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,960
so a lot of the cameras that you'll see

819
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,399
in a neighborhood will have will be

820
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,760
private cameras

821
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:49,199
uh will be police cameras will be

822
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,399
cameras being used by city uh non-police

823
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,640
agencies

824
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,000
there can be a lot of cameras this also

825
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,440
means that you're trying to observe what

826
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,880
cameras are going on there's gonna be

827
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,279
like too much information there'll be

828
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,960
so many cameras in many areas that you

829
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,480
can spend all your time documenting and

830
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,200
observing the cameras and just other

831
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,799
things

832
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,480
so you might not want to spend like all

833
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,240
your time paying attention to that

834
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,559
uh because you can go back later at any

835
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,600
point and see the fixed cameras

836
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:15,600
but there are a couple of things that uh

837
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,279
so first identifying them there are too

838
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,120
many different brands to identify but

839
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,640
here's some information about the kinds

840
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,719
of cameras that are available

841
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,840
uh bullet cameras are directional so you

842
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,559
could sort of see which way it's

843
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,879
pointing

844
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,639
and what it would be covering from that

845
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,640
uh then you have dome cameras

846
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,000
which are designed so you can't see

847
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,520
which way it's pointing or at least you

848
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,960
can see maybe somewhere in this

849
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,080
this area 180 degrees but uh the exact

850
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,440
direction is pointing is

851
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:44,399
obscured by the dome um

852
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,760
pan tilt zoom cameras uh can change

853
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,719
which way they're pointing

854
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:51,120
they can sometimes be coupled with a

855
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,720
dome camera so that the dome camera

856
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,799
can both change the way it's looking and

857
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,840
obscure which way it's looking

858
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,760
uh thermal imaging cameras

859
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,840
and aopr cameras are also going to be

860
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,640
common at fixed locations

861
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,000
uh lpr a lot having to do with the

862
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,159
traffic control

863
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,760
thermal is actually not as common uh

864
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,039
that is mostly used

865
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:17,279
as a uh technology that

866
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:20,158
is uh vehicles uh it's kind of expensive

867
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,440
uh but in this case the uh the picture

868
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,919
shown

869
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,200
is a uh thermal imaging camera so

870
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,080
sometimes people will go to that

871
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,320
additional expense

872
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,600
and one subcategory of all the cameras

873
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,120
that are in the environment

874
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,000
are going to be police observation

875
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,000
devices this is so the category of

876
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,279
sets of sensors which are operated by

877
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,080
the police and

878
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,840
they may include multiple cameras uh

879
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,039
gunshot detection

880
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,360
uh facial recognition uh for example

881
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:52,000
in the united kingdom said the city of

882
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,639
london is doing live facial recognition

883
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,240
uh so police observation devices are

884
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,640
sort of a collection of these

885
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,159
cameras in one location sometimes

886
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,600
they're marked as police

887
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:07,120
uh sometimes they are are not um

888
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,879
and it is the way you would sort of

889
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,439
suspect that it's a police observation

890
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,480
device is if it has a lot of different

891
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,760
sensors in one location trying to cover

892
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,840
the whole ground around

893
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,000
then that is the kind of thing that you

894
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,520
would see most frequently from a police

895
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
observation

896
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,360
uh and then finally smart street lights

897
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,440
now smart street lights

898
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,559
uh are have a number of wonderful app

899
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,880
applications

900
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,639
uh some initiatives like in the us smart

901
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,760
cities and the eu the e street

902
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,159
initiative

903
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,279
are imploring cities to use smart street

904
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,000
lights because they can

905
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,200
turn down the power usage uh when light

906
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,200
is less needed

907
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,360
uh and there are some some advanced ones

908
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,159
a a project by the art hall

909
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,520
university of applied sciences uh has a

910
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,399
technology which will

911
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,840
use motion detection sound detection

912
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,678
being able to

913
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,519
tell if there are people walking nearby

914
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,840
and brighten their path for them

915
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,760
sounds great but the same kinds of

916
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,799
technology being able to detect motion

917
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,600
being able to have audio signals video

918
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,080
signals

919
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,279
can be used for surveillance so here on

920
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,519
the slide we show

921
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,679
uh the smart lighting capabilities being

922
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,000
advertised by intel

923
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,720
uh in addition to some things that you

924
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,320
might

925
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,559
expect like being able to adjust it for

926
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,840
traffic patterns provide better lights

927
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,720
they talk about other things crime

928
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,840
investigations

929
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,440
monitor parking violations uh safety

930
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,639
announcements that are coming from the

931
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,640
smart cameras

932
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,760
so all of these technologies are are

933
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,640
possible

934
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,600
and hopefully this will not become a

935
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,200
commonplace use

936
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,799
but if it is it would mean that a

937
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,720
surveillance device is

938
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,399
everywhere along every street where

939
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,000
they're putting these devices in

940
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,639
uh if you blank in a city you're

941
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,679
flagging a city with surveillance

942
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,720
so has it been used yes the city of san

943
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,720
diego

944
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,000
uh had a number of protests uh

945
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:02,080
surrounding the uh george floyd

946
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,919
uh and they used at least 35 times

947
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,080
they searched the information gathered

948
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,640
through the smart streetlight network

949
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,519
for uh evidence in criminal cases coming

950
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,519
out of that protest

951
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,200
so what additional resources are there

952
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,640
there's plenty of additional resources

953
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,440
if you wanted to drive it more and i

954
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,120
encourage you

955
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,480
to take this only as a starting point

956
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,000
there's a lot more to learn

957
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,360
so we'll start out with a very important

958
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,399
resource if you're someone who's going

959
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,639
to go whether

960
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,840
uh as an activist as a protester as a

961
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,399
journalist

962
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,120
you should prepare yourself uh for some

963
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:37,600
surveillance

964
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:39,840
self-defense ssd.effork.org

965
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,719
we have attending a protest guide you

966
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,279
can go there

967
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,840
and learn important tips on protecting

968
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,840
yourself

969
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,600
when you're going to the protest um you

970
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,000
put your device with full disk

971
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,959
encryption a strong unique password

972
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,919
turning off the biometric unlock use nbn

973
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,320
encryption for messages and calls

974
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,960
walking or taking a bicycle to get to

975
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,720
the protest

976
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,200
instead of a vehicle which can be

977
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,159
subject to an alpr a npr

978
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,080
device uh you know wear a mask you

979
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,799
should wear masks for covet anyway

980
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,840
but if you're gonna wear a mask get a

981
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,600
big

982
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,080
the larger the mask the more it protects

983
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,600
you uh there's also recently a study

984
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,120
that uh showed that

985
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,439
um they're making efforts to try and

986
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,559
make

987
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,200
uh facial briquette recognition continue

988
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,799
on despite people's uses of masks

989
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,960
uh and there was a study that showed

990
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:34,158
that red and black masks were

991
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:37,600
harder for the ai to be able to

992
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:40,559
determine who was behind the mask so

993
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,240
wear a red or black mask uh if you get

994
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,200
one that covers more of your face like a

995
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,559
bandanna

996
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,279
it's going to be harder for the facial

997
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,840
recognition so do some things to protect

998
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,000
yourself

999
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,600
both from covered and from surveillance

1000
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,720
uh if you want also just to try and

1001
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,918
practice it out uh you can go to our

1002
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,559
uh spot the surveillance uh this is a

1003
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,799
online program you can use a desktop

1004
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,440
version or virtual reality version

1005
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,000
where it places you in a virtual street

1006
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,720
corner

1007
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,399
with some surveillance devices nearby

1008
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,678
and you can look around and try to

1009
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,279
identify

1010
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,159
all the surveillance devices that you

1011
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,359
see takes just a few minutes to go

1012
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,359
through the exercise

1013
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,960
but it's a good way to practice your

1014
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,960
skills and identify

1015
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,199
what surveillance might be around on the

1016
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,879
street

1017
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,799
and if you want to get a lot more

1018
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:34,239
information about

1019
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,720
any of these devices go to eff's

1020
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:39,759
street level surveillance project

1021
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:41,279
eff.org street level surveillance

1022
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,440
this will provide more detailed

1023
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,399
information about various technologies

1024
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,879
that

1025
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,440
are in use that can be a good starting

1026
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,598
point

1027
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,760
especially if you have found out what is

1028
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,200
being used in your jurisdiction

1029
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,599
uh you can go there and find out more

1030
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,960
about it uh and you can also find out

1031
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,320
just what is going on

1032
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,119
more generally with these kinds of

1033
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,839
technologies so eff.org

1034
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,599
sls all right well thank you that comes

1035

1039
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,839
thank you

1040
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:26,240
welcome back thanks

1041
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:29,040
thanks so much card well

1042
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,479
we have some time for questions and it's

1043
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,279
getting more and more

1044
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,000
i'm just hurrying up okay are there

1045
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,480
devices

1046
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,480
apps or services developed or run by

1047
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,560
private companies and who makes sure the

1048
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,640
data is not directly sold to third

1049
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,359
parties

1050
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,960
so yes there are uh private networks i

1051
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:49,520
mean one of the things we talked about

1052
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,720
uh just now is there's a lot of private

1053
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,480
camera networks

1054
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,959
that are providing information to the

1055
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,119
police sometimes private networks

1056
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,960
uh go into registry where police from

1057
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,160
organize ask people to volunteer put

1058
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,680
their information

1059
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,359
into a registry so they are sort of

1060
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,200
explicitly saying they're going to turn

1061
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,000
over their information to the police

1062
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,598
other things like amazon's ring camera

1063
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,720
they have been promoting it as a

1064
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,440
anti-theft tool

1065
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,040
trying to stop packaging people's doors

1066
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,200
but this also is creating a

1067
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,400
you know panopticon of everyone's

1068
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,359
doorbell camera

1069
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,160
if they're all using ring will be uh

1070
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,000
provided

1071
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,399
uh get the video and we'll provide it to

1072
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,400
the police so uh

1073
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,839
and many of these uh organizations you

1074
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,520
know if they're a larger one they will

1075
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,240
have some some privacy practices

1076
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,880
probably

1077
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,439
policies but by and large they will talk

1078
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,920
about

1079
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,839
the privacy of the person who owns the

1080
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,000
the case

1081
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,359
and not really consider the bystanders

1082
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,119
the people walking by

1083
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,880
so if you have a doorbell camera at your

1084
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,800
front door they can

1085
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,640
hear uh audio so maybe someone can ring

1086
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,640
your bell and say hello

1087
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,240
it will also capture people walking by

1088
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,040
and those people's privacy is important

1089
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,040
and should be considered

1090
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,319
all right

1091
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,919
then we have what help do we have

1092
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,320
against all this

1093
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,720
which best case legal countermeasures do

1094
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,760
we have when attending protests

1095
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,839
and another one which i would connect

1096
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,760
directly is it possible to intervene

1097
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:20,799
against surveillance based on laws or

1098
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,119
presumption of innocence

1099
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,720
yeah i don't know if if that's if german

1100
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,560
laws are meant but

1101
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,078
maybe you still can say something well i

1102
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,759
mean so there's many different laws that

1103
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,520
might be at issue i mean we have an

1104
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,839
international audience here

1105
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,359
um but uh i think there are some there's

1106
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,240
also basic human rights principles that

1107
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,799
apply

1108
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,799
to many uh jurisdictions but i would say

1109
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,800
actually one of the most effective tools

1110
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,839
to push back against this kind of police

1111
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,960
surveillance

1112
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:48,560
is working locally with the like a city

1113
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,520
the mayor the

1114
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,200
city council in a number of locations

1115
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,880
have passed rules about what

1116
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,439
their police can do against their

1117
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,160
citizens so putting limitations on what

1118
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,200
police can do

1119
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,520
at the local level where your activism

1120
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,598
in the city which you live taking things

1121
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,920
to your representative government

1122
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,680
uh and saying we need to have some

1123
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,839
limitations on this we need to have it

1124
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,118
within civilian control so the police

1125
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,400
themselves are not deciding what

1126
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,000
technologies to use

1127
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,680
but it has to pass through an elected

1128
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
representative and i think that is

1129
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,078
probably

1130
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,440
one of the most effective ways to at

1131
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,760
least start change

1132
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,119
where you live uh but you can also try

1133
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,640
and promote that to

1134
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,880
uh you know national legislature state

1135
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,040
legislatures go up uh uh

1136
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,000
up several levels and one of the things

1137
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,359
that we hope comes

1138
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,480
out of this guide video people getting

1139
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,920
more information about what kind of

1140
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,359
surveillance is available

1141
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,119
is so that they can go to their

1142
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,920
representatives go through the political

1143
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,400
process

1144
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,000
with the information of what tools use

1145
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,160
ah i saw used by

1146
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,440
a drone flying above go to your

1147
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,040
representative and say

1148
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,560
we need to make sure that that the

1149
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,480
information that they're gathered

1150
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,920
is being used in a manner consistent

1151
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,320
with human rights principles

1152
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,200
and we need civilian control from the

1153
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,359
local government

1154
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:02,879
on how to do who is controlling the

1155
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:07,040
controller instances

1156
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:11,440
yes yeah okay we have more questions

1157
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,520
ah okay

1158
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,079
so the police operate equipment like

1159
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,920
ampr reader ms catchers etc that

1160
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,680
get information that they could get in a

1161
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,599
cheaper way

1162
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,240
like reading traffic signs or license

1163
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,000
plates

1164
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:31,919
or sell info from operators

1165
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,760
is there a reason for that especially

1166
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:39,520
concerning eu because u.s differs a lot

1167
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,079
and another question have has police in

1168
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,240
eu

1169
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:45,839
us been known to use illegal or

1170
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,839
questionable tax for surveillance

1171
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:52,960
so i think i'll hurt the first question

1172
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,599
about you know using things like ampr to

1173
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,880
determine

1174
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,079
uh license plates uh this technology is

1175
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,040
common in the uh

1176
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,480
european union uh though by and large it

1177
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,400
is being put in place for

1178
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,920
other reasons not not to get after

1179
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,960
protesters necessarily

1180
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,560
they are looking for uh you know

1181
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,319
making sure that people are paying a

1182
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,599
toll or might be a speed trap on the

1183
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,279
autobahn where it

1184
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,720
uh takes a picture of the license plate

1185
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,079
of anyone traveling

1186
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,359
uh over a speed limit uh in the places

1187
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,319
that have speed limits

1188
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,040
only part of the automotive uh and i

1189
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,520
think

1190
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,400
also it's being used for enforcement of

1191
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,839
things like uh

1192
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,920
traffic citations your your car is

1193
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:35,200
parked in a location too long

1194
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,119
they know who to send the bill to uh

1195
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,319
and i think these technologies could be

1196
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,359
repurposed for

1197
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:42,079
for sale surveillance and that's what we

1198
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,078
really need is

1199
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,160
policies that are ensuring that if these

1200
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,200
things are being used for

1201
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,799
a purpose that the sort of the

1202
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,480
citizenship agrees with in that

1203
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,520
jurisdiction to enforce parking for

1204
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,480
example

1205
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,640
uh that is not also being repurposed uh

1206
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,200
against uh political activities and

1207
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,520
being

1208
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,480
used at a wider scale than it was

1209
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,319
envisioned

1210
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,760
also maybe you know it's it's not a good

1211
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,640
thing to have perfect parking

1212
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,720
enforcement

1213
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,078
uh you know a lot of parking fines were

1214
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,078
based on the notion that like

1215
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,440
you might not get caught every time and

1216
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,640
when you change it where

1217
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,319
a system where previously uh the fines

1218
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,759
were set with the notion that a lot of

1219
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,079
people would get away with it you had to

1220
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,440
like make an example of those who didn't

1221
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,440
and then you change that to perfect

1222
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,160
enforcement because the computer the

1223
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,400
ampr

1224
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,920
system surveillance knows exactly the

1225
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,760
minute that that

1226
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,760
a fine is due and then assesses that

1227
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,280
fine that actually changes the dynamic

1228
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,359
of power between the citizenship and the

1229
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,520
state significantly

1230
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,880
and it will often be phrased in forms of

1231
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,839
well we're just trying to enforce the

1232
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,599
existing laws

1233
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,960
how would you be against that but really

1234
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,760
it changes the dynamic and it's

1235
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,440
something that

1236
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,280
uh for those who want to be an activist

1237
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,720
on this again talk to your local

1238
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,560
jurisdiction and try and make sure that

1239
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,118
these things have safe and sane policies

1240
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,160
that respect human rights so i would

1241
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,640
interpret that

1242
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,640
like prevention of um

1243
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,040
don't don't come into the idea that you

1244
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,960
need to to protect your data right

1245
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,560
yeah and then uh just turning to the

1246
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,920
other one you know do we do we have

1247
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,078
information about whether

1248
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,040
uh police are misusing these

1249
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,880
technologies

1250
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,160
so i mean there's some isolated examples

1251
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,680
uh where

1252
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,359
uh people have misused their

1253
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,879
technologies and i used a couple of them

1254
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,640
in the slide so there was

1255
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,319
someone who went to a political protest

1256
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,920
their car was put into a database they

1257
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:29,040
got pulled over later

1258
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,520
uh and then also in

1259
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,160
south wales the court found that their

1260
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:37,520
the police use of facial recognition

1261
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:40,319
was in violation of uh uk law

1262
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,680
uh though as i noted uh not you know the

1263
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,800
metropolitan police in london don't

1264
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,720
agree with that they say it doesn't

1265
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,960
apply to them and i think actually use

1266
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,279
of facial recognition technologies

1267
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,560
um is a very tempting thing by the

1268
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,520
police they want to use it as much as

1269
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,560
possible makes it

1270
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,000
you know easy for them uh and i think

1271
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,078
you will you'll see that

1272
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,240
but the other piece of this is unless

1273
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,920
there are rules that say

1274
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,000
here are limitations on how you can use

1275
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,000
these technologies then they can use

1276
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
them without having to risk

1277
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,839
violating them so we need to have those

1278
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,359
rules in place i hope that

1279
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:15,279
the council of europe uh puts a at least

1280
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:17,040
a moratorium on facial recognition for

1281
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,599
use for police

1282
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,960
and you know until we can figure out how

1283
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,640
to use this technology

1284
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,920
safely like it's kind of cool that you

1285
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,279
can unlock your phone or your face

1286
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,800
without having to type in a password but

1287
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,440
we want to make sure that technology is

1288
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,280
used properly okay

1289
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,200
so i think you're going to be around in

1290
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,280
the 2d world you're going to explore

1291
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,319
that you told me before

1292
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,960
yeah there's more questions i hope

1293
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,400
maybe maybe you find him in the 2d world

1294
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,119
and you're just asking there

1295
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,260
thanks so much thanks so much everybody

1296
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,839
nice having you bye card
