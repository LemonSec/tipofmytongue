1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:10,520
[Music]

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,520
[Applause]

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,320
all right

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,240
our next talk is corey doctorow who i

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,720
think needs very little introduction

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,400
in this situation but for those who

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,680
don't know him he's an activist he's a

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,279
science fiction author

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,439
and i think he can be described as the

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,080
king of bloggers i remember him

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,920
appearing on xkcd with a cape back in

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,120
the good old days

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,880
um so corey please take it away

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,239
i i don't know how i feel about being a

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,360
king uh

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,839
given given that i'm wearing a

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,559
guillotine badge

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,600
perhaps uh like party secretary uh you

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,959
have my permission

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,840
to take my picture uh so i'm gonna uh

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,120
i'm gonna

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,000
talk today uh about technology and

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,320
optimism

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,680
and uh where it comes from and where it

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,840
needs to go

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,359
and and i want to start by uh well i

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,960
want to start by putting on my slides so

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,119
let's do that

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,600
uh i want to start by busting a myth

30
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,560
uh the the myth of the blind techno

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,080
optimist

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,159
you you've probably encountered this

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,520
story the the story that

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,600
um you know once upon a time there were

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,798
uh a bunch of nerds who had discovered

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,158
the internet and

37
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,680
thought that if we just gave everyone

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,040
the internet everything would be fine

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,759
and that the only thing that they needed

40
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,439
to

41
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,960
work on was making sure everyone got

42
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,320
connected and everything else would take

43
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,479
care of itself

44
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,960
and now those idiots have led us into

45
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,200
this crazy terrible dystopian world

46
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,880
and why didn't they foresee all this

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,799
trouble and and the way that you know

48
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,759
that this blind technological optimism

49
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,360
is a myth

50
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,880
is that people don't go out and start

51
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,159
organizations like the electronic

52
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,520
frontier foundation

53
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,200
because they think that everything is

54
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,759
going to be fine in the end

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,119
you know if there's a motto that

56
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,479
characterizes

57
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,399
those early technological uh optimists

58
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,640
it's not that everything is going to be

59
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,320
great it's that everything will be great

60
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,759
if we don't screw it up and if we do

61
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,880
screw it up it's going to be

62
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,560
really really terrible now

63
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,000
before computing was the source of

64
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,760
regular stock bubbles

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,239
it was just a passion it was driven

66
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,399
not by dreams of riches but by

67
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,440
programmers who were able to make stuff

68
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,920
happen

69
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,520
if you think about what the uh the

70
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,559
journey of a programmer

71
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,200
is it's that first you figure out how to

72
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,480
express your will with sufficient

73
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,839
precision

74
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:38,560
that your computer then enacts your will

75
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,560
and enacts it tirelessly perfectly

76
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,280
computer is connected to a network you

77
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,200
can project your will around the world

78
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,440
you can take the thing that you've built

79
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,760
this self-executing recipe

80
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,200
and you can give it to someone else and

81
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,720
they can execute it as well

82
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,399
it's it's and but it's better than a

83
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,800
recipe right you might have a recipe for

84
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,959
your

85
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,480
grandmother's brownies and when you send

86
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,400
it to someone else they still have to

87
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,480
follow the recipe but a

88
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,599
program is like a self-executing recipe

89
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,440
it's like a machine

90
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,720
that just makes your grandmother's

91
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,319
brownies appear

92
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,480
in every household in the world if they

93
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,079
just download your code and run it

94
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,679
and of course as you get on the network

95
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,000
and you find these people to share your

96
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,560
code

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:33,840
with you're finding the people as well

98
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:33,840
you're finding community

99
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,840
[Music]

100
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
yes

101
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:17,120
[Music]

102
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:32,119
[Music]

103
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:57,840
but well

104
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:03,840
[Music]

105
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,840
[Music]

106
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,280
but not in yeah

107
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,919
that large scale to be honest tried

108
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,359
around

109
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:34,080
quite a few things and uh

110
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,400
had a little little online session for

111
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,800
the

112
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,080
towel day and for all these things we

113
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,759
had the the easter

114
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,000
hack or the the d-voc and

115
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,840
yeah we're working on it to get the

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,080
connection back

117
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,080
so

118
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,080
giant fat phone book sized okay i can

119
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,000
hear the voice

120
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,680
that they would get every month for all

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,880
the things that they did

122
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,759
and so they they um they they ran this

123
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,000
whole system

124
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,919
in the shadows and the last thing they

125
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,680
wanted was for what they were doing to

126
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,120
come to the attention of their bosses

127
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,560
and so they had a whole bunch of rules

128
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,560
about what you could and couldn't create

129
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,080
they especially didn't want any sex

130
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,720
and they didn't want anyone explaining

131
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,880
how to make bombs on use that

132
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,039
and so there would be votes about what

133
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,120
news new news group could be created

134
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,199
but every now and again the backbone

135
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,440
cabal which is what they call themselves

136
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:34,080
okay so we do have a sound of uh

137
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,199
this doctor over here so i think it

138
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,840
shouldn't

139
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,240
shouldn't be too much of a time until we

140
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,359
get

141
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,120
the stream back about cooking should go

142
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,720
under the talk hierarchy

143
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,199
and not under the wreck hierarchy and uh

144
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,400
john gilmore and other people who were

145
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,720
in his company

146
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,239
decided to set up their own alternative

147
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,280
version of usenet called the alt

148
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,319
hierarchy

149
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,159
specifically to allow for a discussion

150
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,400
of cooking wherever the hell they wanted

151
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,280
it

152
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,679
to exercise that little quantum of

153
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,000
self-determination

154
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,599
and very quickly the old hierarchy grew

155
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,199
until it was larger

156
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:14,000
than all of usenet put together

157
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,360
so the worst nightmares of those early

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
digital rights activists

159
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,000
have come to pass we have total

160
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,720
penetration of technology

161
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,080
there is centralization surveillance and

162
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,599
manipulation

163
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,560
of all of our technology everywhere

164
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,919
and the question that i think is a valid

165
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,080
one to ask

166
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,960
is how were we dealt such a stinging

167
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,120
defeat

168
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,198
how did it come to pass that people who

169
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,479
foresaw this danger

170
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,400
and work to uh make things great and not

171
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,400
screw them up still

172
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,638
arrived at this moment where the

173
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,239
internet consists of five giant websites

174
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,199
filled with screenshots of text from the

175
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,199
other four

176
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,560
that's a phrase from tom eastman a

177
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,360
software developer

178
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,599
in new zealand and and this is where i

179
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,280
get to my thesis about about what's just

180
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,360
happened and what needs to happen next

181
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,039
because there is a story about a

182
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,720
technologist that says that the blind

183
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,560
spot was dystopia

184
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,840
the technologist just failed to

185
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,599
understand

186
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,520
that all of this stuff could go horribly

187
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,440
wrong and they really understood

188
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,960
how whoops they really understood how

189
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,199
wrong it could go

190
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,638
um that the thing that technologists

191
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,280
fail to understand

192
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,039
was the relationship of monopolism to

193
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,000
technology and the economy

194
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,560
as it was emerging in the early days of

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,640
the technology revolution

196
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,479
so if you think about the early days of

197
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,880
the commercial internet and commercial

198
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,599
technology personal computing and so on

199
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,919
it was very dynamic companies that were

200
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,080
giants one day ended up being acquired

201
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,360
by upstarts the next day

202
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,040
and that dynamism was not driven solely

203
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,680
by technology but also

204
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,880
by us antitrust or anti-monopoly

205
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,560
enforcers

206
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,040
so i want you to think about what the

207
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,439
experience of a kid in the united states

208
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,040
in the 1980s would have been like if you

209
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,959
were using technology

210
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,079
so you might have gotten your apple ii

211
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,719
plus in say 1980 or 1981

212
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,600
in 1982 the modem that came with it

213
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,480
could suddenly

214
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,519
dial all kinds of services all around

215
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,080
america

216
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,560
at a fraction of the cost that it used

217
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,279
to run

218
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,079
at because 18t had been broken up and

219
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,640
long distance

220
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,720
charges fell through the floor and then

221
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,839
in 1984 you might have replaced that

222
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,600
apple 2 plus

223
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,200
with an ibm pc but it's more likely

224
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,720
that you might have replaced it with an

225
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,800
ibm pc clone

226
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,040
whichever one you replaced it with it

227
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,000
was probably running an operating system

228
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,439
from uh this guy uh the guy who wrote

229
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,959
this letter bill gates

230
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,800
the guy who started this tiny little

231
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,640
company called microsoft and the reason

232
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,399
that the ibm pc

233
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,640
was running code from this little

234
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,320
startup and not from ibm itself

235
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,480
was not because ibm didn't know how to

236
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,560
write code ibm was really good at

237
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,839
writing code they were arguably too good

238
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,040
at writing code

239
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,320
and for 12 years prior to the creation

240
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,560
of the pc

241
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,000
ibm had been in antitrust hell with the

242
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,000
department of justice

243
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,800
in which they were sued and sued and

244
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,600
sued and every year of that 12-year

245
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,479
lawsuit

246
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,560
ibm spent more on its lawyers than the

247
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,480
entire u.s department of justice spent

248
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,800
on all the lawyers pursuing all

249
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,079
antitrust action and one of the things

250
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,000
that the department of justice was

251
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,680
really adamant about

252
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,519
was that if you made hardware you

253
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,319
shouldn't try to monopolize the software

254
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,399
for it

255
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,480
and so even though eventually ibm

256
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,800
prevailed the case was dropped against

257
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,640
it

258
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,319
the last thing they wanted was to get in

259
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,959
trouble with the doj again

260
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,640
and so after this 12-year process when

261
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,160
they made their first pc

262
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,079
they decided not to try and make the

263
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,439
operating system for it instead

264
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,439
they tapped bill gates to make an

265
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,320
operating system for it and then

266
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,079
tom jennings the guy who created fidonet

267
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,560
which was the biggest competitor we had

268
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,959
to use net it was a non-internet-based

269
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,959
distributed message board system tom

270
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,319
jennings who is a virtuoso hardware

271
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,479
engineer who lives a few

272
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,519
kilometers from my home here in los

273
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,519
angeles

274
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,680
he was uh tapped by a company called

275
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,240
phoenix that asked him to reverse

276
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,120
engineer

277
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,320
ibm's roms and he reverse engineered the

278
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,640
pc rom

279
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,399
produced a specification that was used

280
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,279
as the basis for a new clone

281
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,839
rom and that clone rom was sold to pc

282
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,920
vendors

283
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,120
all over the world uh and it's how we

284
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,760
got gateway

285
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,279
dell compaq and all of the other pc

286
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,800
vendors that might have sold you that

287
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,600
ibm pc clone

288
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,959
in 1984 running an operating system that

289
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,880
ibm hadn't made

290
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,560
on phone lines that had been broken up

291
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,600
from a t

292
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,079
and then in 1992 you might have noticed

293
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,240
that that little company microsoft had

294
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,719
grown to be a monopolist itself

295
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,120
with 95 of the operating system market

296
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,880
and so in came the department of justice

297
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,880
and the department of justice spent the

298
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,639
next seven years dragging microsoft up

299
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,800
and down that same gravel road

300
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,839
that they had dragged ibm up and down

301
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,560
for 12 years

302
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,920
and even though microsoft got away the

303
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,160
way ibm had

304
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,040
their behavior was team two because when

305
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,519
a couple of guys in a in a stanford lab

306
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,480
larian sergey named their new search

307
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,240
engine after

308
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,240
uh the largest number they could think

309
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,040
of a one followed by a hundred zeros at

310
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,839
google

311
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,599
microsoft decided not to do to them what

312
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,720
they had done to netscape

313
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,720
because they had seen what the

314
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,160
department of justice does to you

315
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,920
if you do that to your nascent

316
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,439
competitors

317
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,199
and so it felt in those days

318
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,560
like maybe we'd found some kind of

319
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,639
perfect market

320
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,638
a market where you could make your

321
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,560
products with low capital just with this

322
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,120
the sweat of your own mind

323
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,638
by writing code that you could access

324
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,200
the global audience of

325
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,800
everyone who might want to run that code

326
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,440
over a low-cost

327
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,120
universal network and that that audience

328
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,320
could switch to your product at a very

329
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,480
low cost

330
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,920
because uh you could always write the

331
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,360
code that it would take

332
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,079
to uh to port the old data formats

333
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,440
and to connect the old services to your

334
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,439
new product

335
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,040
it was a market where the best ideas

336
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,120
would turn into companies

337
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,399
that would find customers and change the

338
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,320
world

339
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,800
but what we didn't realize what we were

340
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,240
naive about in those halcyon days of the

341
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,839
early internet

342
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,600
was that anti-monopoly law the

343
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,440
anti-monopoly law that had made things

344
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,920
so robust and dynamic

345
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,360
that had given everyone a uh who who had

346
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,120
access to a computer

347
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,120
a chance to try and make a dent in the

348
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,519
universe that that anti-law

349
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,120
antitrust law had been shot in the guts

350
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,360
in 1982

351
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,519
and was bleeding out it's all thanks to

352
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,920
this guy robert bork

353
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,639
robert bork is kind of an obscure figure

354
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,319
for for

355
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,440
most people these days although i said

356
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,519
that on twitter the other day and a

357
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,800
bunch of people in their 50s said i know

358
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,320
who robert bork is

359
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,560
but i think if you're not an american in

360
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,920
your 50s or or a certain kind of weirdo

361
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,199
conservative activist you've probably

362
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,199
never heard of this guy

363
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,560
robert bork was a richard nixon

364
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,719
solicitor general

365
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,680
and he committed crimes for richard

366
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,760
nixon

367
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,519
and they were so egregious that when

368
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,040
ronald reagan

369
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,199
uh tried to appoint him to the u.s

370
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,360
supreme court the senate decided not to

371
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,240
confirm him because he was too grimy

372
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,240
for the u.s supreme court and so instead

373
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,519
he became a kind of court sorcerer to

374
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,560
ronald reagan

375
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,120
and he created a new theory about

376
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,119
when monopoly laws should be enforced a

377
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,920
theory he called the consumer harm

378
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,320
theory the the consumer harm theory says

379
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,959
that

380
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,720
we don't hate monopolies because

381
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,479
monopolies are bad

382
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,320
we only hate monopolies because they

383
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,720
sometimes raise prices

384
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,440
and so long as a company that has a

385
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,680
monopoly

386
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,519
isn't immediately raising prices after

387
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,680
they acquire that monopoly

388
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,680
it's okay to let the monopoly form and

389
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,560
to let the monopoly fester

390
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,160
and this idea was incredibly popular and

391
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,239
not just with ronald reagan

392
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,319
every one of the neoliberal leaders of

393
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,600
the reagan era from helmut cole

394
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,720
to margaret thatcher to brian mulroney

395
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,760
to augusto pinochet took up the ideas of

396
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,079
robert bork

397
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,839
and said that from now on we are not

398
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,680
going to get rid of our monopolies from

399
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,279
now on we're going to encourage the

400
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,479
growth of monopolies on the grounds that

401
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,439
they are efficient

402
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,959
and only shut them down if we can prove

403
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
that they've used their monopoly to

404
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,040
raise

405
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,959
prices now this idea is a stupid idea

406
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,040
but it's incredibly popular for rich

407
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,719
people because rich people like the idea

408
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,560
that they could buy shares and companies

409
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,360
that could establish monopolies and

410
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,920
those rich people funded robert bork

411
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,120
they created among other things a series

412
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,160
of junkets

413
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,360
called the man seminars m-a-n-n-e the

414
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,000
man seminars are

415
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,759
continuing educational seminars for u.s

416
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,199
federal judges in florida

417
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,279
where you fly to florida stay in a

418
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,959
luxury hotel and get lectured on the

419
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,279
brilliance of robert bork

420
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,199
forty percent of u.s federal judges have

421
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,439
been through the man seminars

422
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:57,120
unsurprisingly those judges are far less

423
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,199
likely to punish monopolistic conduct

424
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,560
the the people who like robert bork

425
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,519
funded law schools

426
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,839
and economics departments and journals

427
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,560
and

428
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,360
they they turned the idea of consumer

429
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,920
harm

430
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,040
into a kind of global doctrine that has

431
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,079
now taken over

432
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,759
every single regulator in the west china

433
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,599
has a slightly different vision of it

434
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,199
as does russia but the european union

435
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,279
canada the us

436
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,240
most of central and south america have

437
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,040
all adopted

438
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,519
uh these rules i i don't know um to what

439
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,199
extent

440
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,639
these rules have penetrated the african

441
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,439
markets um

442
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,000
and so and and consumer harm this idea

443
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,720
that

444
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,839
uh monopoly should only be shut down if

445
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,680
you can show that they're using

446
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,000
monopolism to raise prices

447
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,199
is incredibly hard to prove in fact you

448
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
could basically call it

449
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,920
impossible to prove and as a result

450
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,720
anti-competitive conduct became so

451
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,360
routine

452
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,720
that we no longer think of it as unusual

453
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,160
until the bork era

454
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,480
here are some of the things that were

455
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,079
considered violations of antitrust law

456
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,519
and that would have attracted scrutiny

457
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,160
from a regulator

458
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,360
merging with a major competitor

459
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,600
acquiring a small

460
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,199
competitor or creating a vertical

461
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,400
monopoly where you own different parts

462
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,760
of the supply chain

463
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,839
like google buying an ad tech company

464
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,039
now the story of how tech got

465
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,240
monopolized

466
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,799
leans hard not on robert bork but on all

467
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,880
these exotic ideas like network effects

468
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,639
the idea that if you uh if you have one

469
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,319
fax machine it's useless and two are

470
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,559
very useful and three are twice as

471
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,240
useful and four is twice as useful again

472
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,320
and that once a tech company starts to

473
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,360
become successful the network affects

474
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,678
snowball

475
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,120
and you will never dethrone it despite

476
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,000
the fact that we no longer have

477
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,520
friendster

478
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,039
or alta vista or uh amigas

479
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,760
or any of these other potential

480
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:47,120
purveyors of network effects

481
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,960
a close look at how tech companies grew

482
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,639
does not show that network effects is

483
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,360
what led to that growth

484
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,160
instead you see predatory conduct

485
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,639
moneyball

486
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,480
using access to the capital markets to

487
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,320
raise gigantic amounts of money

488
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,559
and buy or merge with all of your

489
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,120
competitors as the means by which they

490
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,639
grew

491
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,320
and as an example of this i want you to

492
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,080
think about google for a minute

493
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,000
so google is a company that has made

494
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,120
exactly one and a half successful

495
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,720
in-house products

496
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,719
they made a really good search engine

497
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,000
and a pretty good hotmail clone

498
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,840
everything else that they've made

499
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,080
in-house died

500
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,918
right this is just a small sample of the

501
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,120
google product graveyard

502
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,960
and everything that they've done that's

503
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,320
successful android

504
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,480
ad tech um uh

505
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,918
youtube and so on all of these are

506
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,360
companies that they acquired from

507
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,240
someone else

508
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,879
so this is not a company that has uh a

509
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,600
natural monopoly due to a network effect

510
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,240
um this is a company that has uh an

511
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,039
unnatural and monopoly due to predatory

512
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,559
conduct now network effects are indeed

513
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,320
real they are a thing

514
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,160
and you can see them exemplified pretty

515
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,159
well with the bell system this was what

516
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,320
we called att in the us before was

517
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,880
broken up in the 1980s

518
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,480
but with uh with net with tech network

519
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,679
effects are very different from other

520
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,840
kinds of industries

521
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,960
you know think of the railroad industry

522
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,199
where once you have

523
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,440
uh rails that run from one place to

524
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,200
another it doesn't make any sense to to

525
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,320
put in a second set of rails

526
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,919
and so uh the uh uh custom accrues to

527
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,600
that rail vendor which can add more

528
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,200
rails to more destinations

529
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,799
and before long you have these natural

530
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,160
monopolies emerging in rail

531
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,240
but that's not how it works with

532
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,679
technology and the reason

533
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,320
is that technology has interoperability

534
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,760
so built into our general purpose

535
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,559
computers and our general purpose

536
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,960
network

537
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,879
is the ability to run any program

538
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,520
provided you can express it in symbolic

539
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,080
logic

540
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,400
and to interface any new network service

541
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,559
with any existing network service

542
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,320
now oftentimes that interoperability is

543
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,960
deliberate and engineered someone will

544
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,520
go to a standards body like the w3c

545
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,240
and decide on what an http header looks

546
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,400
like

547
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,760
but just as often that interoperability

548
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,520
is adversarial

549
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,440
that interoperability is a form of

550
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,000
competitive compatibility

551
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,679
where a new company makes a product that

552
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,320
plugs into an existing product or

553
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,720
service

554
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,480
without permission against the wishes of

555
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,200
the people who made the existing product

556
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,159
or service

557
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,440
like tom jennings making his ibm pc roms

558
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,679
and what happens then

559
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,799
is that the walled garden of the company

560
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,960
that came before

561
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,280
becomes a feedlot in which all of the

562
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,280
customers have been handily penned in

563
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,559
so that the new market entrant can go

564
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,158
over and uh

565
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,720
choose whichever ones they want and

566
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,799
devour them in a smorgasbord

567
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,320
so to think about how this worked with

568
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,440
the bell system

569
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,678
um the the bell system originally uh had

570
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,280
not just a monopoly over the wires

571
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,720
but a monopoly over the things that

572
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,840
connected to the wires

573
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:47,039
it was against the law to connect a uh

574
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,000
uh a phone or a phone-like device or

575
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,960
even a thing that clicked

576
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,240
onto a phone to a phone that came from

577
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,919
the bell system or

578
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,240
to a jack that the bell system had

579
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,480
installed and they argued

580
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,400
that because they were a monopolist they

581
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,720
were part of america's national security

582
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,400
and safety apparatus and that allowing

583
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,120
third parties to connect things to their

584
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,960
network

585
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,479
would result in the network being made

586
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,520
unreliable and therefore

587
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,919
america being made insecure and unsafe

588
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,799
but they didn't use this power just to

589
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,559
keep the network

590
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,960
operational they use this power to

591
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,960
extract monopoly rents to make money

592
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,880
by screwing over their customers by

593
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,760
preventing new market entrance so for

594
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,559
example

595
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,320
uh to see where how bad this got you can

596
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,320
look at where it broke down

597
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,799
uh the the first time that this system

598
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,360
broke down was when uh att

599
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,440
sued a competitor called husha phone and

600
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,600
hush your phone was a plastic cup

601
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,720
that snapped over the mouthpiece of your

602
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,199
bell phone

603
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,120
so that um when you were speaking your

604
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,720
voice would be muffled and people who

605
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,158
are in the same room as you would find

606
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,520
it hard to listen in on your

607
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,400
conversation

608
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,320
and 18t argued that the hashaphone

609
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,480
because it was mechanically coupled

610
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,840
to the bell system endangered the

611
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,440
integrity the bell system

612
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,959
and their regulator told them to go

613
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,440
pound sand they said

614
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,280
no this doesn't endanger the system get

615
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,799
used to it people can connect things to

616
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,120
their phones and that's when they lost

617
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,720
mechanical coupling prohibitions

618
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,879
and then they went after another company

619
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,280
called carter foam and carter phone made

620
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,320
a walkie-talkie that plugged into

621
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,399
a regular rj11 jack or a

622
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,240
that you could connect your phone to and

623
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,200
it was for people who worked on ranches

624
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,720
and farms

625
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,400
so that they could they could clip a

626
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,159
walkie-talkie onto their belt

627
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,080
and go out and work in the barn or ride

628
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,200
out on the range and still take their

629
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,480
phone calls

630
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,880
and uh 18t argued that by electrically

631
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,679
coupling devices to the bell system

632
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,200
that they were violating att's monopoly

633
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,360
and endangering america

634
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,559
and again their regulator told them that

635
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,559
that was not a

636
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,600
valid reason and they lost the ability

637
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,280
to block electoral

638
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,959
electrical coupling and this is where we

639
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,720
see the growth of everything from modems

640
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,159
to answering machines

641
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,240
and all of the other devices that

642
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,120
eventually plugged into the belt system

643
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,200
so interoperability can turn network

644
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,280
effects on their head

645
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,679
and interoperability was really key to

646
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,840
the growth of the tech monopolist today

647
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,360
so think about the iwork suite and its

648
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,439
history

649
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,360
before the iworks suite came about apple

650
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,000
was in really serious trouble

651
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,199
in enterprise networks if if you ran a

652
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,799
business

653
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,480
chances are most of the computers in

654
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,960
your network were pcs

655
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,559
but maybe the designer or an executive

656
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,840
who had the right to decide what kind of

657
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,960
computer they would use

658
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,678
was would be running a mac and the way

659
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,320
that that

660
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,159
uh microsoft punished you for running

661
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,200
that macintosh in the microsoft

662
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,000
environment

663
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,400
was by dragging their heels on updating

664
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,960
the microsoft office suite for the mac

665
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,760
and so max became this kind of cursed

666
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,520
zone

667
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,158
where someone were to send a word file

668
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,080
or an excel file to a mac

669
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,400
and that file was then opened and saved

670
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,320
again it would never be openable again

671
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,720
on any computer anywhere in the world it

672
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,600
would be irretrievably corrupted

673
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,440
and bill gates did not uh fix this

674
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,639
because steve jobs went to him and asked

675
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,799
him pretty please

676
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,840
to make a better microsoft office suite

677
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,440
for the mac

678
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,879
instead steve jobs got a bunch of

679
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,279
engineers to reverse engineer

680
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,559
the uh the file formats and then they

681
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,000
produced iwork

682
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,879
whose pages numbers and keynote are used

683
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,279
to read and

684
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,000
write office files perfectly and very

685
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,480
quickly

686
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,760
they were able to colonize the microsoft

687
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,520
office environment

688
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,559
running ads like the switch ads where

689
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:31,600
they said well you may have hesitated

690
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,440
to give up your windows pc because all

691
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,439
of your files are stuck in there

692
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,200
but what if i told you that you could

693
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,279
read and write all the files ever

694
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,880
created with a windows system

695
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,640
and you could do it from a mac by

696
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,159
running one piece of competitive

697
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,919
compatibility software

698
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,520
of software that was adversarially

699
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,640
interoperable with the microsoft

700
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,400
ecosystem

701
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,720
and that is what rescued the mac from

702
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,799
the scrap heap of history

703
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,600
and it wasn't just software it was also

704
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:00,960
hardware uh in the early 1990s

705
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,439
um lexmark was uh the or rather the late

706
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,799
1990s lexmark was the printer division

707
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,000
of ibm the

708
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,799
not very well reformed monopolist and um

709
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,640
lexmark used little microchips to stop

710
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,679
people from refilling their laser toner

711
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,919
cartridges

712
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,520
and a company called static controls a

713
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,120
little taiwanese company reverse

714
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,960
engineered that microchip

715
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,279
it only held a 12 byte program so it

716
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,440
wasn't hard and they made new chips that

717
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,600
would allow you to refill your cartridge

718
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,720
lexmark lost their lawsuit against

719
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,719
static controls

720
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,720
and so now static controls had this huge

721
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,520
installed user base of people who were

722
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,600
desperate

723
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,200
for cheap toner cartridges and instead

724
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,918
of having a network advantage

725
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,640
lexmark now had a network disadvantage

726
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,640
today

727
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,679
lexmark is a division of the company

728
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,039
that owns

729
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,000
uh static controls and it's not of

730
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,960
course hardware

731
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,880
also it's also network services when

732
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,559
facebook first got off the ground

733
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,559
mark zuckerberg had a really serious

734
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,320
problem which is that everyone who

735
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,240
wanted to use social media

736
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,399
already was on the dominant social media

737
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,840
platform a company called myspace

738
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,840
that was owned by the world's most

739
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,559
rapacious vicious billionaire

740
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,480
rupert murdoch and again zuck did not go

741
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,799
to rupert and say please allow your

742
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,240
users to talk to my users because

743
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,240
people want to use facebook but they

744
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,840
don't want to leave their friends behind

745
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,240
instead what they did was they made a

746
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,199
bot and you give that bot your login

747
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,600
credentials

748
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,520
and it would go to myspace and scrape

749
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,080
the waiting messages that were there for

750
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,760
you

751
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,120
and put them in your facebook inbox and

752
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,080
you could reply to them and it would

753
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,678
pilot them back

754
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,960
out to myspace now all of this

755
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,799
uh led to a very dynamic system

756
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,480
that completely changed the way that we

757
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,400
interacted with technology

758
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,679
but all of this has gone the way of the

759
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,600
dodo and

760
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,679
the reason for that is that as these

761
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,039
companies acquired new monopolies

762
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,919
they diverted their monopoly rents to uh

763
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,799
um

764
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,159
foreclosing on competitive compatibility

765
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,600
so you may remember the

766
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:02,720
urgent fight over software patents uh

767
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,399
the growth of software copyrights uh

768
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,000
the uh ongoing problem of

769
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,679
anti-circumvention rules that make it

770
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,679
illegal to break drm

771
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,200
most recently seen in the shutdown of

772
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,400
youtube dl

773
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,240
uh enforceable terms of service facebook

774
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,640
has just used its terms of service to

775
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,480
try and shut down ad observatory

776
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,000
an academic project that tracks

777
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,799
facebook's compliance with its own

778
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,360
policies

779
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,879
on political paid disinformation and

780
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,559
they've said that uh because this

781
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,600
service violates their terms of service

782
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,200
it's illegal

783
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,120
uh never mind that facebook had to

784
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,880
violate myspace's terms of service to

785
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,120
gain its ascendancy

786
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,440
and then new uh rights that were are

787
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,840
purchased with very expensive lawsuits

788
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,799
so

789
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,559
today we have the google oracle lawsuit

790
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,600
going through the supreme court in the

791
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,279
united states

792
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,199
that might create a new copyright over

793
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,840
apis

794
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,760
now um all of these uh things patents

795
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,520
copyrights anti-circumvention terms of

796
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,600
service novel copyrights

797
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,720
they trade under the name intellectual

798
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,439
property

799
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,039
and if you're familiar with without

800
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,720
phrase intellectual property you'll know

801
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,679
that free culture activists

802
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,039
hate this term um in fact when you ask

803
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,840
them what we should call these things

804
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,200
sorry there's my

805
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,959
software patent slide i knew i had one

806
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,320
in there somewhere when when you

807
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,840
when you call when you ask them what we

808
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,439
should call intellectual property they

809
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,399
say oh you should call it the author's

810
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,600
monopoly

811
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,439
because that's what they called it in

812
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,039
the days of the uh

813
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,559
uh the statute of anne that's what they

814
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,480
call it in the founding in the united

815
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,520
states authors monopolies

816
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,120
and authors get really pissy when you

817
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,720
say that they have a monopoly

818
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,399
and they do for good reason because

819
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,919
although formally the fact that i wrote

820
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,918
this speech and therefore i have the

821
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,159
monopoly over reading it to you

822
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,200
on my microphone means that i am a

823
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,440
monopolist

824
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,720
i don't have a market power monopoly

825
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,960
right i i can't uh

826
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,559
use this monopoly to extract monopoly

827
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,120
rents from the marketplace

828
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,799
uh writers who go to the the five

829
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,120
remaining publishers soon to be four of

830
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,639
bertelsmann buys out simon schuster

831
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,479
don't get to use the fact that they have

832
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,440
a monopoly to negotiate

833
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,039
uh crazy supermarket prices that go

834
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,640
beyond what what would happen in a

835
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,440
competitive market

836
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,039
unlike say the uh the monopolist

837
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,799
themselves the actual monopolists we

838
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,240
have who get to charge very high prices

839
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,679
for their services

840
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:19,039
and so um it's it's not a bad

841
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,720
point that an author's monopoly is not a

842
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,240
monopoly in the way that we talk about

843
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,080
it when we talk about monopolism in the

844
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,360
tech sector

845
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:30,399
but ip does have a very precise meaning

846
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,959
uh a meaning that is not uh has nothing

847
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:35,279
to do with intellectualism or property

848
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,360
ip in this sense of software patents

849
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,159
copyrights anti-circumvention terms of

850
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,120
service

851
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,840
uh api copyrights and so on it has the

852
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,399
precise meaning of any law or rule

853
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,918
that lets me decide who can criticize me

854
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,080
who can compete with me

855
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,360
and who and how my customers must behave

856
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,960
themselves

857
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,959
and when you fuse a market power

858
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,679
monopoly with an author's monopoly when

859
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,240
you have an

860
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,120
uh market power monopoly that has ipv

861
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,200
behind it

862
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,039
you get something far more durable than

863
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,520
either a regular monopoly

864
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,559
or a an author's monopoly a copyright

865
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,240
monopoly

866
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,799
you get a monopoly that the government

867
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,320
will defend rather than dismantling

868
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:16,240
uh so for example if you have a monopoly

869
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,480
that you can defend with a patent

870
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,799
right like today you have hp

871
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,480
monopolizing its ink cartridge market

872
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,080
and they have patents over the security

873
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,120
chips and their ink cartridges

874
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,760
the government will seize compatible ink

875
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,158
cartridges

876
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,240
at the border on your behalf for vi

877
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,159
because they violate your patents

878
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,440
and so instead of punishing you for

879
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,600
creating a monopoly

880
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,960
the government will reward you by doing

881
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,240
your enforcement work

882
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,840
for you and not only that but once you

883
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,480
have a monopoly that's backed by

884
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,678
some kinds of ip like anti-circumvention

885
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,919
the government will

886
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,799
punish people who report defects in your

887
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,600
products

888
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,799
so if you have a monopoly over printers

889
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,600
or if you have a

890
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:02,158
monopoly over phones and someone

891
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,760
finds a defect that allows third parties

892
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,279
to install their own ink or their own

893
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,760
app stores

894
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,559
the circumvention of your drm becomes a

895
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,080
crime

896
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,158
under article 6 of the european

897
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,000
copyright directive and under section

898
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,399
1201 of the digital millennium copyright

899
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
act

900
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,080
and under similar laws all around the

901
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,240
world and the government will both

902
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,519
find and potentially imprison the

903
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,039
security researchers

904
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,120
who point out that your products have a

905
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,039
defect in them

906
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,959
now i started this talk by saying that

907
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,799
early internet boosters were not blind

908
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,159
to the perils of technology

909
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,760
but some of them were a little after all

910
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,200
once all that money started sloshing

911
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,960
around then if you could convince

912
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,200
yourself that tech was an unforced

913
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,559
an unchecked force for good then you

914
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,080
could also convince yourself that

915
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,600
getting all of that money that the tech

916
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,559
industry was generating

917
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,480
would make you on the side of good the

918
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,320
myth of two guys in a garage who could

919
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,760
topple billion dollar giants and become

920
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,399
billionaires themselves

921
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,200
fired a lot of techies imaginations and

922
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,320
sidelined

923
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,279
a lot of their conscience but those days

924
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,158
are behind us

925
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,360
thanks to monopolies thanks to

926
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,519
monopolies

927
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,279
founders who want to start businesses

928
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,399
that compete with the monopolists

929
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:15,760
monopolists who have double-digit growth

930
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,158
every year and who realize tens if not

931
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
uh

932
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,360
hundreds of billions of dollars in

933
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,120
profit collectively

934
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,959
those founders when they go to a venture

935
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,639
capitalist or another funder

936
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,960
are told that the funders aren't

937
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,480
interested in funding these direct

938
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,480
competitors

939
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,679
funders call the lines of business that

940
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,080
big tech is in

941
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,919
the kill zone and they understand that

942
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,439
any attempt to fund a business that

943
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,279
operates in the kill zone

944
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,200
will result in your company being

945
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,840
crushed by the monopolistic power

946
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,480
of the entrenched company and so in

947
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,399
instead

948
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,399
if you are a technologist headed to

949
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,760
silicon valley you don't dream of

950
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,080
changing the world

951
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,440
you dream of like having a mini kitchen

952
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,000
with free kombucha

953
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,720
and maybe getting massages on wednesday

954
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,519
on the

955
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,120
on the behalf of the company and

956
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,880
liberated from the fear of losing

957
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,360
customers to competitors

958
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,399
tech has pivoted from uh liberating

959
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,879
customers

960
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,799
to manipulating locking in and abusing

961
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,039
their users

962
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,799
and the code that does that manipulation

963
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,960
that abuse and that lock-in

964
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,399
it's all written by technologists

965
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,679
technologists who discovered their

966
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,959
passion for the field

967
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,120
when they felt the thrill of

968
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,080
self-determination through writing code

969
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,719
and projecting it over

970
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,918
networks and this is a really important

971
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,440
fracture line

972
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,360
i think this is a way to understand

973
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,080
things like the googler walkout and tech

974
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,559
won't build it

975
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,080
no tech for ice the solidarity movements

976
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,720
against facial recognition and other

977
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,559
surveillance technologies that um

978
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,960
technologists are no longer uh

979
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,559
able to delude themselves with the

980
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,399
thrill of billions

981
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,760
into thinking that it's okay to do what

982
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,239
they're what they've been doing

983
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,080
and one by one in increasing numbers

984
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,799
they're starting to wake up to the fact

985
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,480
that it's time to do better it's time to

986
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,600
realize the liberatory power of

987
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,039
technology

988
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,959
and step back from the power of

989
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,480
technology to control us that

990
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,399
this will all be so great if we don't

991
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,039
screw it up and if we do screw it up

992
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,679
it's going to be

993
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,199
really really terrible and there are

994
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,440
precedents for this and unfortunately

995
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:16,638
the precedents are pretty incomplete

996
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,000
so robert oppenheimer very famously was

997
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,399
one of the few people in the world who

998
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,800
was both

999
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,000
brilliant enough at being a manager and

1000
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,720
brilliant enough of being a nuclear

1001
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,480
physicist

1002
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,239
that he could lead the creation of the

1003
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,040
first nuclear bomb and the manhattan

1004
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,598
project in los

1005
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,639
alamos in the united states and

1006
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,200
legendarily

1007
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,079
as that first nuclear bomb test went off

1008
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,879
he turned away

1009
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,040
from the mushroom cloud and said i am

1010
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,199
become death destroyer of worlds and

1011
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,480
embarked on a lifelong project

1012
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,439
to demilitarize the atom to to put back

1013
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,159
in the bottle

1014
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,040
the genie that he had made and and my

1015
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,599
hope

1016
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,359
is that we can arrive at a world in

1017
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,399
which our oppenheimers

1018
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:58,480
decide to put down their tools before

1019
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,160
they make their atom bombs instead of

1020
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,440
after that that we are at this

1021
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,839
crossroads now

1022
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,440
where not only are the harms so visible

1023
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:09,200
that they're undeniable

1024
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,839
but also the rewards for building

1025
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,240
the digital equivalent of these a-bombs

1026
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,599
have

1027
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:18,319
dwindled from a star in

1028
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,400
technologies hall of fame to a really

1029
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,800
well-funded pension plan

1030
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,400
and surely that is not enough to sell

1031
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,880
out for

1032
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,760
so many of you listening today have

1033
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,280
probably uh

1034
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,920
read my novel little brother in its

1035
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,000
sequel homeland i know that because

1036
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,599
i often hear from you especially at

1037
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,720
events like ccc and

1038
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,880
and uh defcon and uh shmukan and at

1039
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,160
uh thoughtcon and so on people come up

1040
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,960
to me and they say

1041
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,240
you know i read your book and i i

1042
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,960
understood

1043
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,560
both how powerful technology could be

1044
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,800
and how terrifying it would be

1045
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,920
if that power was not harnessed for the

1046
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,560
people and instead

1047
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,480
was harnessed to oppress people and it

1048
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,279
made me embark on my career as a

1049
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,680
technologist

1050
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,359
a security researcher a human rights

1051
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,598
activist a cyber lawyer

1052
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,440
and you know that's the best thing in my

1053
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,320
life really i mean you know apart from

1054
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,960
my kid

1055
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,640
and my family the fact that there are

1056
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,160
people out there who have devoted their

1057
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,598
lives to doing something better

1058
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,960
because of something i wrote that's

1059
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,320
that's really important to me and

1060
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,000
frankly you know if my kid has got a

1061
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,079
chance of growing up in a world

1062
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,200
that doesn't make orwell look like an

1063
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,960
optimist

1064
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,720
it's going to be in part because of that

1065
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,960
stuff but

1066
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,480
i've written a new little brother book i

1067
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,800
wrote this book that came out this year

1068
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,839
called

1069
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,480
attack surface and this is genuinely not

1070
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,920
an ad

1071
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,599
you don't have to read it and in fact if

1072
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,040
you're watching this you probably don't

1073
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,480
need to although you might enjoy it

1074
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,400
because this is aimed at a different

1075
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,839
kind of technologist

1076
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,280
this is a a story about the kind of

1077
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,599
technologist

1078
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,720
who spends their whole life kidding

1079
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,640
themselves

1080
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,759
that working on systems of control and

1081
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,520
oppression

1082
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,119
are not that big a deal because if they

1083
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,240
didn't do it someone else would do it

1084
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,280
there's an endless supply of

1085
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,759
oppenheimers

1086
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,240
and if i turn my back someone else will

1087
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:08,240
be there to to finish my work

1088
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:11,040
who come to a realization may be belated

1089
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,640
that they've spent their whole life

1090
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,680
building a dystopia that they don't want

1091
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,000
to live in

1092
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,839
and who redeem themselves who come back

1093
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,480
from the brink

1094
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:22,240
and the reason i wrote this story now is

1095
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,280
because i really wanted

1096
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,479
to reach the technologists who are

1097
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,680
waking up every day and saying i fell in

1098
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,880
love with this stuff because it

1099
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,640
liberated me

1100
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,119
and i spend my days figuring out how to

1101
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,000
take away the future of people who might

1102
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,440
be liberated by

1103
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,680
it themselves and that's an urgent

1104
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,480
message because author authors

1105
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,680
monopolies

1106
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,920
ip are available to everyone

1107
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,240
thanks to the internet of things thanks

1108
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,560
to our embedded systems i'm going to

1109
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,439
break here and editorialize very briefly

1110
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,920
uh this is the slide i'm most proud of

1111
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,079
uh

1112
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,920
not not for any kind of intellectual

1113
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,520
heft but i'm really bad at the [ __ ]

1114
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,280
and i think i did a really good job so i

1115
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,000
just want to if you're if you're looking

1116
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,760
away from your screen

1117
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,359
if you're like peeling vegetables or

1118
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,280
something spare a glance

1119
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,160
at this slide i'm very happy with this

1120
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:16,079
slide so the iot

1121
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,560
means that um every device in our world

1122
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,760
has access to an author's monopoly has

1123
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,200
ip in it

1124
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:26,640
and that governments will enforce the

1125
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,960
strictures that the designers and

1126
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,279
manufacturers these devices put into

1127
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,960
them by punishing people who try to use

1128
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,000
competitive compatibility

1129
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,119
to undo those strictures and not only

1130
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,400
that

1131
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:43,680
but iot devices are not

1132
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,640
merely smart as a convenience to invoke

1133
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,040
the law

1134
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,680
they're also smart as a way to enforce

1135
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,599
the manufacturer's desires as a way

1136
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:56,720
to control the the actions of users

1137
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:59,520
of competitors uh and of critics

1138
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,040
that these devices have a kind of

1139
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,759
unblinking eye

1140
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,200
that watches you whenever you use them

1141
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,480
and if it catches you trying to do

1142
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,078
something that might displease the

1143
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,320
manufacturer's shareholders

1144
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,760
it can stop you and it can rat you out

1145
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,280
to the authorities

1146
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,800
and so you know speaking in my

1147
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,640
professional capacity

1148
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,040
as a dystopian science fiction writer

1149
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,000
this scares the [ __ ] out of me

1150
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,560
now that is all a kind of grim way to

1151
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,240
end and so i'm gonna finish this off

1152
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,759
with a couple of words on what gives me

1153
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,439
hope and

1154
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,800
and this comes from my colleague james

1155
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,280
boyle

1156
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,079
at the duke center for the public domain

1157
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,480
and jamie

1158
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,000
when he talks about uh the computer

1159
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,720
liberation movement

1160
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,640
he compares it to the ecology movement

1161
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,279
and before the term ecology

1162
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,040
was coined we didn't have a movement we

1163
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,040
just had a bunch of issues

1164
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,480
some people cared about whales some

1165
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,640
people cared about owls

1166
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,920
some people cared about the ozone layer

1167
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,440
and maybe they thought that the people

1168
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,560
who cared about another issue were doing

1169
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,640
important work

1170
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,320
but it wasn't their work and they

1171
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,078
weren't really on the same side they

1172
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,720
weren't part of the same cause

1173
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,160
but the term ecology changed all of that

1174
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,640
the term ecology

1175
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,480
took a thousand issues and turned it

1176
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,480
into one movement

1177
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,680
one movement that everyone had each

1178
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,359
other's back on

1179
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,359
even if the reason you were in the

1180
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,720
movement was owls you were there to

1181
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,839
fight the corner of the people who cared

1182
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,200
about the ozone layer

1183
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,440
and you began to understand that these

1184
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,399
were all facets of the same

1185
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,800
problem well today monopolies have taken

1186
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,040
over

1187
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,319
and destroyed the lives of people in a

1188
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,759
million ways

1189
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,920
right whether you're a professional

1190
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,560
wrestling fan a beer drinker

1191
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,119
a whiskey drinker an eyeglass wearer a

1192
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,480
plain

1193
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,079
flyer in someone who relies on energy or

1194
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,400
financial services

1195
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,920
or whose money was stolen by a company

1196
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,400
whose auditors were one of the

1197
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,359
big four accounting firms whether you

1198
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,240
are someone who is

1199
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:54,640
upset because there's four uh movie

1200
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,879
studios left or three record labels

1201
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,480
or because there's only one movie

1202
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,240
theater left in the united states one

1203
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,520
movie theater chain of any size left in

1204
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,720
the united states

1205
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,400
or whether you're pissed off that you're

1206
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,319
not going to get the vaccine because in

1207
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,000
the u.s there's only one company that

1208
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:11,279
makes glass bottles

1209
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,440
of any size all of these people

1210
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,040
don't know it but they're in the same

1211
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,640
side they're on the same fight

1212
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,560
and that fight is the fight against

1213
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,680
monopolies

1214
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,520
now people talk about big tech as though

1215
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,040
they're super geniuses

1216
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,160
but when we rip off the mask we discover

1217
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,000
that these are not

1218
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,839
titans who built monopolies through

1219
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,920
their special genius they're just

1220
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:36,078
three sociopaths in a trench coat

1221
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,839
they're just the latest version

1222
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:41,040
of the kind of monopolist that we have

1223
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:43,599
been fighting since time immemorial

1224
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,000
since the rockefellers since the melons

1225
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:48,000
since every monopolistic family

1226
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,520
that tried to establish a dynasty that

1227
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,560
would allow them to rule as though they

1228
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,200
were kings

1229
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,480
was broken up and relegated to just

1230
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,439
having their names on a couple of

1231
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,960
buildings

1232
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,560
we know how to deal with these people

1233
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,520
and it's time that we dealt with them as

1234
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,520
for what they are which is just plain

1235
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,359
old-fashioned sociopaths

1236
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,680
and not as super geniuses who stand

1237
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:10,078
astride the world like colossi

1238
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,078
thank you

1239
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:18,240
thank you thank you i think i'm back now

1240
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,960
all right well thanks for this talk um

1241
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,118
we are

1242
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,520
basically out of time so we're moving

1243
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,400
the q a to the fireside chat which will

1244
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,359
happen

1245
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,640
in i think 20 minutes or so and then all

1246
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,920
the questions that have already been

1247
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,040
asked for this talk will also be

1248
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,160
answered then

1249
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,200
but corey um i think we had a short

1250
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,399
stream outage

1251
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:41,759
around minute five okay so if you

1252
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,440
know what you said at minute five um you

1253
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,880
can maybe try to

1254
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,160
try to read a picture i don't know what

1255
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,000
i said um history of networks apparently

1256
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,598
unfortunately it was not visible for us

1257
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,680
so i don't know myself but i think it

1258
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,960
was

1259
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,160
it might have been my story about the

1260
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:01,119
alt hierarchy that's probably it and

1261
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,480
and if you uh if you go to your favorite

1262
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,480
search engine whether it's like alta

1263
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,119
vista or ask jeeves or yahoo

1264
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,400
and type in alt dot uh interoperability

1265
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,760
dot adversarial

1266
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,000
you'll find an article i wrote for the

1267
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,400
electronic frontier foundation about

1268
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,440
the history of the old hierarchy so uh i

1269
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,520
think that's probably what got cut out

1270
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,480
okay wonderful thank you i think people

1271
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,160
know how

1272
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,240
lycos is also indexed yes they'll try to

1273
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:41,839
they'll try to figure it out

1274
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:41,839
all right well thank you very much

1275
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,839
