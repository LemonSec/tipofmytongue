[Applause]

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,640
it's simple

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,279
when ice gets above zero degrees it

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,840
melts

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,759
but is it really that simple if we are

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,000
not talking about a small ice cube but a

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,960
big sheet of ice covering an entire

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,240
continent

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,560
is that really the only factor and am i

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,640
right with my assessment

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,839
i'm looking forward to be enlightened by

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,079
professor ricardo

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,840
winkelmann erica winkelmann is a

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,800
professor of a climate science at

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,879
the university of potsdam and she's also

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,959
a researcher for climate impact

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,440
and city is the dynamic the ice dynamics

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,760
working group and code is the future lab

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,440
on earth resilience in the anthropocene

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,640
her research focuses on tipping elements

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,120
from the earth system

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,120
and uh today she'll be talking about the

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,680
green land and and arctic ice dynamics

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,239
and the future sea level rise that are

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,199
impacted

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,440
by them uh it appears like she's truly

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,080
an

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,600
expert on all things related to ice so

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,798
please give a warm hand of applause for

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,720

40
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,760
thanks and welcome today we're going to

41
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,640
take a little excursion to the far

42
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,120
north and the far south to our polar ice

43
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,319
sheets

44
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,800
on greenland and antarctica

45
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,319
as this year is coming to close i

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,840
thought we'd take a brief

47
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,720
moment to to reflect back um 2020 has

48
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,840
certainly been

49
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,840
an exceptional year for all of us and it

50
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,040
was supposed to be a super year

51
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,720
for nature and the environment as world

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,280
leaders put it at the beginning

53
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,400
of the year five years after the paris

54
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,720
climate accord

55
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,120
it's five years after the sustainable

56
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,840
development goals have been announced

57
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,120
however 2020 turned out to be the year

58
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,159
when we've had to face

59
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,440
several global crises including

60
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:29,040
the ongoing covet 19 pandemic and also

61
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,359
the ongoing climate crisis

62
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,040
what almost got lost in in the turmoil

63
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,120
is that this year also saw

64
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,959
several weather and climate extremes

65
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,840
which spanned the globe from pole to

66
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,560
pole

67
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,519
with temperatures reaching record highs

68
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,280
in the arctic and

69
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:48,319
antarctica with plus 38 degrees

70
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,000
in of celsius in the arctic and in

71
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,280
siberia that's the highest temperature

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,200
that was ever recorded

73
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,200
north of the arctic circle and it's

74
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,040
roughly 18 degrees warmer than the

75
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,839
average maximum daily temperature

76
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,400
in june when this was recorded and we

77
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,319
also saw plus 18 degrees

78
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,080
at the antarctic peninsula which is

79
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,280
again the highest temperature ever

80
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,840
recorded

81
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,640
in antarctica and this was followed by

82
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,120
widespread

83
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:18,079
melting on nearby glaciers

84
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,639
now if we're kind of zooming out and

85
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,720
taking a look at the bigger picture

86
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,400
we're also at a very significant point

87
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,000
in earth's history

88
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,320
here you see the global mean temperature

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,759
evolution since the last glacial maximum

90
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,400
so the last ice age

91
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,800
until today and whenever i look at this

92
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,599
graph

93
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,720
i see two things that still strike me to

94
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,639
this day

95
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,320
one is that the holocene the

96
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,080
interglacial the warm age

97
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,599
in which human civilizations have

98
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,520
developed and thrived

99
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,199
that has been characterized by very

100
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,159
stable climate conditions by a very

101
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,360
stable global mean temperature

102
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,759
and the other thing is that the

103
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,040
difference between an ice age here 20

104
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,919
000 years ago roughly and in a warm age

105
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,479
that's roughly

106
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,400
three to four degrees of global average

107
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,560
temperature change

108
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,159
and we're right now on the verge of

109
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,360
achieving the same temperature

110
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,919
difference

111
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,120
but at much much faster rates so here

112
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,840
you see

113
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,520
several future temperature projections

114
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,840
from the ipcc

115
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,840
and what you can see is that in all of

116
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,520
them the temperature increase

117
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,159
even the lowest one the temperature

118
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,960
increase is much faster than has ever

119
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,440
recorded before so i think it's safe to

120
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,039
say

121
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,520
that we have truly entered the

122
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,800
anthropocene and that humans have become

123
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,799
a geological force

124
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,000
so in the entropy humans have become the

125
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,880
single

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,320
most important driver of global change

127
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,800
affecting the entire earth system

128
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,880
including our ice sheets

129
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,840
but it was kind of the opposite in the

130
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,320
past

131
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,840
like no other forests on the planet ice

132
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,960
ages have actually shaped our

133
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,440
surroundings

134
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,039
and thereby determined our development

135
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,759
as human civilizations

136
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,639
for instance we owe our fertile soils to

137
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,280
the last age

138
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,639
ice age that also carved our current

139
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,039
landscape that we see

140
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,680
all around us leaving glaciers behind

141
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,080
rivers

142
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,240
and lakes so even though the ice sheets

143
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,440
on greenland antarctica might seem far

144
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,319
away sometimes

145
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,800
they're actually crucial also for us

146
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,759
here

147
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,479
today and today i want to leave you with

148
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,440
an impression

149
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,120
why they are so important and one reason

150
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,039
they are so important is because they're

151
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,160
an amazing climate archive

152
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,960
here you see an ice core taken from

153
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,600
yeah one of the deepest parts of an ice

154
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,758
sheet

155
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,360
and this is basically like counting

156
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,000
three rings you can go back

157
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,440
to the past and you can see what the

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,880
climate was like

159
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,080
in the deep past ranging several

160
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,120
hundreds of thousands

161
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,880
of years back and you can see the

162
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,680
conditions for instance in the co2

163
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,240
change

164
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,160
the temperature change over these really

165
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,160
long time scales

166
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,319
so that's one of the reasons why the ice

167
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,960
sheets are so important

168
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,319
another one is their so-called sea level

169
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,719
potential

170
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,360
green and antarctica are truly sleeping

171
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,440
giants

172
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,520
and to give you an idea of the sheer

173
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,759
size of these two ice sheets

174
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,599
and one way of doing that is to compute

175
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,080
their ice volume in the so-called sea

176
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,120
level

177
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,520
equivalent what this means is if we were

178
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,360
to melt down the greenland ice sheet

179
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,039
and distribute that melt water around

180
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,880
the entire globe

181
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,080
then this would lead to global sea level

182
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,599
rise of roughly

183
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,240
7 meters for the western arctic ice

184
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,639
sheet

185
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,919
it's about 5 meters and for east

186
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,360
antarctica

187
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,080
the 10 fold so more than 65 meters in

188
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,000
total

189
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,198
of sea level potential that are stored

190
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,280
in these two ice sheets

191
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,800
now over the past decades the ice sheets

192
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,878
have both been losing

193
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,960
mass and they've been losing mass and at

194
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,879
an accelerating pace

195
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,799
in fact we're currently on track with

196
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,759
the worst case climate change

197
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,360
scenario here you see the observations

198
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,599
in grey and you also see

199
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,960
several of the projections from the past

200
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,639
for the ice sheets

201
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,479
and as you can see we're tracking this

202
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,400
upper branch here so we're really

203
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,080
on track with the worst case climate

204
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,359
change scenario for the ice

205
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,080
sheets and what this means is even if we

206
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,919
were to stop global warming today

207
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,359
the ice sheets would still keep losing

208
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,960
mass because of the inertia and the

209
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,039
system so sea levels would

210
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,080
keep rising for decades or even

211
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,080
centuries to come

212
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,320
why is that well there are several

213
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,518
processes that we need to understand

214
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,760
in order to keep track of sea level

215
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,440
change and also to understand

216
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,679
the ice sheets evolution in the past and

217
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,800
in the future here you see sort of an

218
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,519
exemplary cut

219
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,479
through an ice sheet shelf system where

220
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,040
the ice sheet is

221
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,800
in contact with the atmosphere you have

222
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,880
the grounded part

223
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,800
and then in many places you also have

224
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,000
these extensions these floating

225
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,240
extensions

226
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,600
um the so-called ice shelves that

227
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,240
surround particularly

228
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,800
antarctica the separation between the

229
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,959
two

230
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:12,319
is the so-called grounding line

231
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,880
now generally ice sheets gain mass

232
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,680
through snowfall just on top of the the

233
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,320
ice sheet

234
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,519
which then is compressed into ice and

235
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,560
over time

236
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,680
due to the sheer gravity and the sheer

237
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,079
size of the ice sheets

238
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,800
it's basically pushing its own mass

239
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,279
towards

240
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,519
the ocean and that's one of the reasons

241
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,399
why there's a constant flow of ice so

242
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,680
ice is really

243
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,120
not only solid it's also fluid the ice

244
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,920
sheets can also lose mass

245
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,519
through surface melting but also through

246
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,040
melting at the undersides

247
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,360
of the floating ice shelves where

248
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,040
they're in contact with warmer ocean

249
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,600
waters and then there can of course also

250
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,079
be

251
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,519
ice shelf cabin so icebergs that break

252
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,519
off at the margins

253
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,680
of the ice sheet now what we see here

254
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,640
this left hand side that's a typical

255
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,880
situation for the greenland ice sheet

256
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,000
the gradient ice sheet is generally

257
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,279
grounded above

258
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,360
sea level um in most parts and it's

259
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,839
not only much smaller than antarctica

260
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,680
but it's also located further south

261
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,200
so further away from the pool and that

262
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,319
means it's generally warmer

263
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,680
in greenland leading to more surface

264
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,200
melt for the greenland

265
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,319
ice sheet whereas in antarctica

266
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,000
it's not only much colder there

267
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,440
but also the ice sheet is covered and

268
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,240
and surrounded by

269
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,440
floating ice shelves almost all around

270
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,880
the coastline

271
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,040
and that means that one of the most

272
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,320
important driving processes for maslow's

273
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,640
in antarctica

274
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,640
is this melting underneath the ice

275
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,399
shelves so the sub shelf melting

276
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,399
in contact with the warmer ocean waters

277
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,040
just to give you an impression of the

278
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,440
sheer ice thickness

279
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,240
i brought this picture here this is my

280
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,519
very first

281
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,839
impression of the antarctic coastline

282
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,920
the

283
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,600
and ice shelf margin this is close to

284
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,920
the german research station

285
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,959
noi maya 3 and i will never forget the

286
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,360
moment that i first

287
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,640
saw the ice shelf edge it was in the

288
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,120
middle of the night

289
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,760
but we were there in summer so we had 24

290
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,320
hours of

291
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,319
daylight and i woke up because it

292
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,480
suddenly got dark in our cabin

293
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,680
so i went up to the bridge to see what

294
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,640
was going on

295
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,040
and i saw myself in front of a wall like

296
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,120
really

297
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,360
cliff of ice and um knowing that

298
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,640
these ice shelves behave like the ice

299
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,560
cubes and the water glass so only

300
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:40,640
roughly 10 percent

301
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,760
are visible above the sea um sea level

302
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,839
this means that in this case we had

303
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,360
an ice shelf edge that was more than a

304
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,360
hundred meters thick

305
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,120
and that really impressed me i

306
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,079
immediately had to think of this german

307
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,200
expression

308
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,599
thus eevee guys the eternal eyes

309
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,360
and i really wondered if this is maybe

310
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,519
yeah the right expression because

311
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,480
it seemed like it was so static and

312
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,440
nothing

313
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,120
was moving however that's not true

314
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,000
because even in equilibrium

315
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,440
the ice is constantly moving so you're

316
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,800
just visualized by these

317
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,959
little snowflakes and you can see how

318
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,719
the ice is moving from the interior

319
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,119
towards the coastlines

320
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,000
and we have a wide range of velocities

321
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,320
at the surface

322
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,440
ranging from almost zero in the interior

323
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,320
of the ice sheet

324
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,240
to several kilometers per year and the

325
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,560
larger ice shelves and also in the

326
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,680
so-called ice streams the faster flowing

327
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,719
ice if i were able

328
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,439
to take a dive underneath

329
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,200
the ice shelves and i could actually

330
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,279
take a look at the grounding line

331
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,720
this would probably be what what i could

332
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,800
see um this is

333
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,880
the triple point basically where solid

334
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,800
earth the ice and water

335
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,560
all come together and this grounding

336
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,560
line plays a very important role

337
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,319
for antarctic ice dynamics and also for

338
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,319
the future fate of antarctica

339
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,600
so what makes the dynamics of the ice

340
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,040
sheets and shelves so particularly

341
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,839
difficult to understand and also

342
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,240
to project the future evolution is that

343
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,720
both ice sheets are subject to several

344
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,360
so-called positive so self-reinforcing

345
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,399
feedback

346
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,680
mechanisms here are just some

347
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,760
examples with some of the major ones

348
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,040
we we know very well one is the ice

349
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,040
albedo feedback

350
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,040
and another one is the so-called melts

351
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,279
elevation feedback

352
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,439
as i said in greenland we observe a lot

353
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,279
of surface melting if you've ever flown

354
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,519
across the grain and ice sheet

355
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,399
in summer you can really see these

356
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,720
rivers

357
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,360
forming and then even lakes forming at

358
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,560
the ice sheet surface

359
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,920
and over the recent decade greenland has

360
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,638
been subject to several

361
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,719
extreme melt events including

362
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,399
particularly the years 2010

363
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,160
2012 and also last year and the reason

364
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,079
there is this extreme melting at the

365
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,160
surface is due to a combination

366
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,760
of factors it has to do with the

367
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,160
duration of the summer

368
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,880
but also even here in europe we observed

369
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,000
very

370
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,959
warm and and dry summers and that's also

371
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,760
something

372
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:18,399
that was observed for greenland so that

373
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,639
for instance in the year 2019 in august

374
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,760
almost the entire ice sheet surface was

375
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,440
covered with melt water

376
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,399
now why is this surface melting so

377
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,160
important the reason is that there is

378
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,639
also a self-reinforcing feedback that

379
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,079
could be driven by surface melting

380
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,160
and we all know this mechanism from

381
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,560
mountain climbing if you climb down

382
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,079
from the peak of a mountain towards the

383
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,319
valley it gets warmer

384
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,199
around you and the same is true also for

385
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,839
the ice sheets

386
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,959
so if there's enough melting it could

387
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,839
actually lower

388
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,560
the surface to a region where the

389
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,399
temperatures

390
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,839
are higher the surface temperatures are

391
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,079
higher leading to more

392
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,040
melting which again lowers the surface

393
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,479
elevation

394
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,480
leading to higher temperatures leading

395
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,480
to more melting and so on and so on so

396
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,880
that this can

397
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:09,440
trigger these self-reinforcing dynamics

398
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,439
and whenever we have such a positive or

399
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,880
self-reinforcing feedback mechanism

400
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:18,000
we can also have a tipping point and

401
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,240
here is a depiction of a very simple

402
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,560
way of computing where the tipping point

403
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,120
might be for the green and ice sheet

404
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,000
where we've really done this with just

405
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,120
analytical work

406
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,079
so pen and paper trying to understand

407
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,800
where we go from a stable green ice

408
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,599
sheet

409
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,959
into a unstable regime which would then

410
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,360
lead to meltdown

411
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,000
of the entire ice sheet until basically

412
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,880
no ice

413
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,639
is left at the surface so this is

414
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,000
something that we can understand in

415
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,800
theory

416
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,920
but also something that we find in more

417
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,959
complex numerical ice sheet models

418
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,079
and they find that this warming

419
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,399
threshold

420
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,519
that leads to basically a decay of the

421
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,320
entire ice sheet

422
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,240
lies somewhere between 0.8 and 3.2

423
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,040
degrees of warming above pre-industrial

424
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,279
levels

425
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,719
and you can see that between these

426
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,439
temperatures somewhere there's

427
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,880
almost a step change from this is now

428
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,440
computed and sea level

429
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,199
rise so um up here this means that

430
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,160
greenland is ice free so we're going

431
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,959
from an intact

432
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,560
green ice sheet to an ice free greenland

433
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:26,399
ice sheet somewhere between

434
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,959
these temperatures what this looks like

435
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,959
can be visualized with numerical ice

436
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,959
sheet models and here you see that once

437
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,880
this threshold is exceeded

438
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,479
basically the ion dynamics lead to a

439
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,519
complete meltdown

440
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,720
of the ice sheet until there's almost no

441
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,800
ice left except

442
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,800
for in the highest region he's here in

443
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,279
the east where there are some small ice

444
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,399
caps

445
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:51,040
remaining now

446
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,759
something similar but also different is

447
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,319
going on

448
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,839
in antarctica because as i said earlier

449
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,600
antarctica

450
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,360
in antarctica it's much colder so we

451
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,680
have very little surface melt

452
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,759
at the moment but at the same time it's

453
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,799
surrounded by the floating ice shelves

454
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,120
and they play

455
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,760
the major role in driving healthy

456
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,159
changes in antarctica

457
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,439
and arctic mass loss has tripled over

458
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,000
the recent

459
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,919
years especially in the so-called

460
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,400
amundsen and bellinghausen sea regions

461
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,079
so

462
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,120
these are these regions here where you

463
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:26,639
see all these red parts so this is all

464
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:29,678
ice loss that's been detected here

465
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,520
and the reason for this is

466
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,200
due to the ice shelf ocean interactions

467
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,559
so here you now see the ocean

468
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,559
temperatures surrounding

469
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,480
antarctic ice shelves and you can see a

470
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,200
stark difference between

471
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,720
the temperatures here around the amazon

472
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,559
and bellings housing regions

473
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,640
and the temperatures for instance here

474
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,160
in the wettel sea or in the ross sea

475
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,000
um the temperature difference being

476
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,480
roughly two degrees so

477
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,760
there's really been a switch um from a

478
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,799
colder to warmer

479
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,679
cavity for instance here in the amundsen

480
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,120
sea region and that drives more

481
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,360
sub-shelf melting

482
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,479
which in turn leads to a decrease of the

483
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,439
so-called buttressing

484
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,240
effect what this means is well first of

485
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,160
all

486
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,799
the ice shelves do not contribute to

487
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,919
sea level rise directly at least not

488
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,840
significantly

489
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,280
the reason being that they are like ice

490
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,840
cubes in a water glass and

491
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,440
if if that melts down it also doesn't

492
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,520
raise the water level

493
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,760
in the glass so similar with the ice

494
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,600
shelves but at the same time they are

495
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,320
still attached to the grounded part

496
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,280
of the sheet so if the ice shelves melt

497
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,280
um ores

498
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,720
or their larger carving events in the

499
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,440
ice shelves that means

500
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,840
that the flow behind them from the

501
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,160
interior of the ice sheet into the ocean

502
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,918
accelerates it's almost like pulling a

503
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,600
plug

504
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,360
and this is um what is called the

505
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,039
so-called buttressing effects with back

506
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,280
stress at the grounding line

507
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,520
so if we have enhanced ice shelf melting

508
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,760
that means that this buttressing effect

509
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,840
this buffering effect is reduced and

510
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,600
therefore we have accelerated outflow

511
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,240
into the ocean

512
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,080
now the question is how does this impact

513
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,039
the ice sheet dynamics overall in

514
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,520
particular

515
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:14,320
the stability of the west and east

516
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,639
antarctic ice sheets

517
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,559
you may have come across some of these

518
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,280
headlines in recent years

519
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,440
my favorite one is still this one up

520
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,678
here from 2014

521
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,840
where the holy moment of global

522
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,000
warming was declared

523
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,840
and the reason for this were these

524
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,640
observations from the amundsen

525
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,320
um region in west antarctica so we're

526
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,120
now taking sort of a flight

527
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,879
into the amundsen sea region and what

528
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,039
was observed over the recent decades

529
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,919
is not only that the glaciers here have

530
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,080
accelerated

531
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,160
so everything that's shown in red is

532
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,320
accelerated ice flow

533
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,400
but at the same time the glaciers have

534
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,840
also retreated and the deep parallel is

535
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,480
behind

536
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,678
so you see this browning at the surface

537
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,919
now so all of this

538
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,840
changes where the the glaciers have

539
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,720
basically retreated

540
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,039
and with this comes another

541
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,200
self-reinforcing

542
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,879
feedback the so-called marine ice sheet

543
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,640
instability

544
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,080
for the marine ice sheet and stability

545
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,280
to occur

546
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,918
we need two conditions to hold one

547
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,918
as depicted here is that the ice sheet

548
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,520
is grounded below sea level which is

549
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,360
true for many parts of west

550
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,960
antarctica but also some parts of east

551
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,678
antarctica

552
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,480
and also we need to generally have a

553
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,440
retrograde

554
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,840
sloping bed so that means that the

555
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,039
bedrock elevation

556
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,000
decreases towards the interior of the

557
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,640
ice sheet

558
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,440
and when these two conditions hold then

559
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,640
we can show

560
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,840
in two dimensions mathematically even

561
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,960
prove mathematically

562
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,399
that the an instability occurs in this

563
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,600
kind of case

564
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,520
the reason is that we have an a feedback

565
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,719
between the grounding line retreat and

566
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,039
the ice locks across

567
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,960
the grounding line if the grounding line

568
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,320
retreats in a case where we have a

569
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,559
retrograde sloping bed

570
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,320
and the ice is grounded below sea level

571
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:07,440
that means that the ice thickness

572
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,240
towards the interior is larger and this

573
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,120
generally

574
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,640
also means that the ice flux across the

575
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,399
grounding line is larger

576
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,000
leading to further retreat of the

577
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,640
grounding line and so on and so on

578
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,440
so again we have a positive feedback

579
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,919
mechanism

580
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,600
that could drive self-sustained ice loss

581
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,880
from parts of the west and

582
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,240
east antarctic ice sheet and the concern

583
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,039
is now that this marine ice sheet

584
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,600
instability

585
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,559
is potentially underway in the amazon

586
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,158
basin here

587
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:39,840
in western antarctica now what's unclear

588
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,720
is how fast this change would actually

589
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,639
occur

590
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,080
so if we have actually triggered the

591
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,080
marine ice sheet instability

592
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,399
in this region and that means we have a

593
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,439
committed ice loss of roughly

594
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,679
one meter sea level equivalent

595
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,440
then the question is still how fast does

596
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,240
this occur and for this it really

597
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,640
matters

598
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,600
how much further global warming

599
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,080
continues

600
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,799
so and at which rate of the temperature

601
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,520
will change in the future

602
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,520
so this is um what's happening in part

603
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,280
of the western arctic ice sheet

604
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,280
we were also asking ourselves what could

605
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,879
something like this also happen for east

606
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,678
antarctica and how stable

607
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,960
are each of the different ice basins in

608
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,440
in antarctica

609
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,880
so we did something of a stability check

610
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,039
on the antarctic ice sheet

611
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,760
to assess the risk of long-term sea

612
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,158
level rise from these different regions

613
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,200
what you will see next is an animation

614
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,919
where we're

615
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,120
increasing the global mean temperature

616
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,240
but we're increasing it

617
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,479
very very slowly at a much slower rate

618
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,159
than the typical rate of change in the

619
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,080
ice sheet

620
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,760
to test for the stability of these

621
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,960
different parts and what we see

622
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:52,000
is that at roughly two degrees we

623
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,840
are losing a large part of the western

624
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,039
arctic ice sheet so there's the first

625
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,120
tipping point

626
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,200
around two degrees and then as the

627
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,399
temperature increases

628
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,520
also the surface elevation is lowered

629
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:09,039
and that leads to potentially then also

630
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,520
triggering these surface elevation and

631
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,640
melt elevation feedbacks in east

632
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,760
antarctica

633
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,960
so around 6 to 9 degrees there's another

634
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,879
another major threshold and after this

635
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,280
large parts of the eastern arctic ice

636
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,400
sheet

637
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,879
could also be committed to long-term sea

638
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,559
level

639
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,880
rise at about 10 degrees

640
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,399
the antarctic ice sheet could

641
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,799
potentially become

642
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,640
ice-free on the long term and this is

643
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,280
really important what we're seeing here

644
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,039
are not projections um but what we're

645
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,559
seeing here is a stability check so

646
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,640
we're not looking at something that's

647
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,240
happening within the next century or so

648
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,559
but rather we're interested in

649
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,159
understanding at which temperatures

650
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,200
the antarctic ice sheet could still

651
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,760
survive on the long term

652
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,400
we also wanted to see if some of these

653
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,000
changes

654
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,159
are reversible and what we find is

655
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,600
a so-called hysteresis behavior of the

656
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,640
antarctic ice sheet

657
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,199
that means as we're losing the ice

658
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,720
and we then cool the temperatures back

659
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,520
down

660
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,720
the icy does not regrow back to its

661
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,480
initial state

662
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,000
but it takes much much colder

663
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,240
temperatures to regrow

664
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,679
the same ice sheet volume that we are

665
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,880
currently having

666
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,559
at present day temperature levels

667
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,240
so there's a significant difference

668
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:32,000
between this retreat

669
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:35,919
and the regrowth path and this can be up

670
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,679
to 20 meters of sea level equivalent

671
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,279
in the difference between these two

672
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,480
paths

673
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,440
what this looks like originally you can

674
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,840
see here

675
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,960
so again we have the retreat and the

676
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,120
regrowth path

677
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,559
at two degrees of global warming and

678
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,320
four degrees of global warming

679
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,840
so these are the long-term effects at

680
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,240
these temperature levels

681
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,520
and you can see that for instance for um

682
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,919
for four degrees

683
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,679
large parts of east antarctica and also

684
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,480
of the western activities you do not

685
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,760
regrow at the same temperature level so

686
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,840
we clearly observe

687
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,120
this hysteresis behavior that's another

688
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,639
sign that

689
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,239
that the antarctic ice sheet is a

690
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:17,279
tipping element in the climate system

691
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,440
so both greenland and antarctica are

692
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,720
tipping elements in the climate system

693
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,360
there are a number more candidates for

694
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,240
tipping elements including some of the

695
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,600
larger

696
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,000
biosphere components for instance the

697
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,719
amazon rainforest the tropical coral

698
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,120
reefs

699
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,039
and also the boreal forests as well as

700
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,719
some of the large-scale circulations

701
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,640
um so for instance the atlantic

702
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,799
thermo-hairline circulation or what we

703
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,640
often term the gulf stream

704
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,840
and the indian summer monsoon are

705
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,919
tipping candidates

706
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:50,240
in the climate system now if we go back

707
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,159
to our temperature evolution since the

708
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,120
last spatial maximum

709
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,480
and we now insert what we know about the

710
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,158
tipping thresholds

711
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,799
of these different components in the

712
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,039
earth system then this is what we get

713
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,240
and we see that there are basically

714
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,960
three clusters

715
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,880
of tipping elements in comparison to the

716
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,400
global mean temperature here

717
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,640
and you see in these burning amber

718
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,279
diagrams that some of these tipping

719
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,240
elements

720
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:18,080
are at risk of switching into a

721
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,960
different state even within

722
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,000
the paris range of 1.5 to 2 degrees of

723
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,320
forming

724
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,200
and among these most vulnerable tipping

725
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,120
elements are

726
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,480
the western arctic ice sheet and the

727
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,039
greenland ice sheet

728
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,159
and in general the cryosphere elements

729
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,840
which

730
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,919
seem to react to global warming and

731
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,039
climate change much faster therefore

732
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,039
belong to the most

733
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:46,000
vulnerable parts of the earth system

734
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,520
so if there's one thing that i would

735
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,440
like you to take away

736
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,360
from this talk it is that ice matters

737
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,039
i've presented you with three reasons

738
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,080
why first of all

739
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,720
polar ice acts as a climate archive it

740
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,080
also

741
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,279
acts as an early warning system

742
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,120
secondly glaciers and ice sheets are

743
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,200
important contributors already

744
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,120
to currency leverage but they will

745
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,600
become even more important

746
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,320
in the future as the global mean

747
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,000
temperature

748
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,158
keeps rising and thirdly both greenland

749
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,399
and antarctica are tipping elements

750
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,080
in the earth system and one of the next

751
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,158
things we need to understand is how

752
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,600
these tipping elements interact with one

753
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,880
another because we have a very good

754
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,959
understanding by now

755
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,080
of the different mechanisms behind these

756
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,840
tipping elements

757
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,600
and of the individual temperature

758
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,678
thresholds but one of the

759
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,879
i think most important questions we need

760
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,799
to ask ourselves

761
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,200
is how the interaction of the tipping

762
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,000
elements changes the stability of the

763
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,600
earth system

764
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,360
as a whole and if there could be

765
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,399
something like domino effects

766
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,158
in the earth system and with this thank

767
00:27:50,399 --> 00:28:03,840
you so much for your attention and i'm

768
00:27:52,159 --> 00:28:03,840
very much looking forward to questions

769
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,840
hello

770
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,520
and we are now going to have a q a and

771
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,559
if you have any questions regarding this

772
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,200
awesome talk

773
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,879
then please post them to the signal

774
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,440
angels they are following

775
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,799
on twitter and the federalists if you're

776
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,520
using the hashtag hashtag rc31 because

777
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,480
this is

778
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,440
rc yeah one hall and you can also post

779
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,600
your questions to

780
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,200
the irc and i already have a first

781
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,199
question i don't know uh

782
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,240
ricardo if you can hear me but is there

783
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,960
anything that uh

784
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,679
this specific ssc community of nursing

785
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,880
hackers

786
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,159
can do more than anyone else uh to help

787
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,399
with this issue what

788
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,440
what do you think that we can do to help

789
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,918
this

790
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,600
yeah thank you so much um great question

791
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,559
let me start by saying i'm a nerd and

792
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,840
hacker myself

793
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:24,480
um i'm a developer or co-developer

794
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,279
of the parallel ice sheet model that's

795
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,120
one of the

796
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,640
the ice sheet models for greenland and

797
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,039
antarctica that's being

798
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,480
used around the globe and with many

799
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:36,080
different applications

800
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,240
so yeah as a fellow nerd and hacker

801
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,199
i can say there's lots we can do in

802
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,159
particular

803
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,320
towards understanding even better the

804
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,039
different dynamics of the green and the

805
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,760
antarctic

806
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,520
ice sheet but also beyond that for the

807
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,080
earth system as a whole

808
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,000
i think we're now at a point where we

809
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,158
understand the individual components

810
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,240
of the earth system better and better we

811
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,960
also have better and better observations

812
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,000
satellite observations but also

813
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,600
observations at the ground to

814
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,200
further understand the different

815
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,600
processes but what we need

816
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,720
now is to combine this with our

817
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,000
knowledge and

818
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,760
in the modeling community and also with

819
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,159
some of the approaches from

820
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,600
big data machine learning and so on to

821
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,919
really put this together

822
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,639
and all the different puzzle pieces to

823
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,960
understand

824
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,840
what this means for the earth system as

825
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,760
a whole

826
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,959
and what i mean by that is we now

827
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,760
understand that there are several

828
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,159
individual

829
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,360
tipping points in the earth system and

830
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,360
we also know that

831
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,479
as global warming continues we're at

832
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,279
higher risks of

833
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,039
transgressing individual tipping points

834
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,919
but what we still need to understand

835
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,960
is what does this mean for the overall

836
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,320
stability

837
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,320
of our planet earth

838
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,120
thank you for this extended answer to

839
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,320
this question

840
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,199
uh i have another one and i would like

841
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,879
uh to know um you showed a slide where

842
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,679
you showed the browning of the eye

843
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,720
surface

844
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:07,840
and then explained that this speeds up

845
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,679
the process of melting as well like

846
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,879
done by deer but can we just paint it

847
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,880
white or

848
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,960
with a reflective paint on it has this

849
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,440
been simulated is this of interest to

850
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,320
you scientists yeah very good question

851
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,080
so basically

852
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,320
um what you're addressing here is the

853
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,519
question of the so-called ice albedo

854
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,360
feedback we all know this um that um as

855
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,960
we're wearing black clothes and summer

856
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,959
it's warmer than when we're wearing

857
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,360
white clothes and the same is basically

858
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,880
true

859
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,639
for our planet as well um so the ice

860
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,960
sheets and also the sea ice

861
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,720
in the arctic and antarctica they

862
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,399
contribute considerably

863
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,440
to um a net cooling still off the planet

864
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,639
so if we didn't have these ice

865
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,240
landscapes

866
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,559
that would mean that the planet would

867
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,360
warm even faster and even further

868
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,360
than it already is today so currently

869
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,719
the ice albedo feedback is still

870
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,199
helping us with keeping the temperatures

871
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,039
um

872
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,080
at lower levels than they would be

873
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:08,559
without um the ice landscapes

874
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,720
um and yeah therefore it is definitely

875
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:13,120
of interest to further understand

876
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,880
what what would this mean for for

877
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,600
instance the global mean temperature but

878
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,640
also

879
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,519
regional changes if we were to lose our

880
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,679
ice cover

881
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,760
completely and also the reverse question

882
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,600
of course if we were to whiten

883
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,600
parts of the planet then how would this

884
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,879
affect the temperature

885
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,918
one thing that we found out is that if

886
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:37,120
we were to lose uh the ice

887
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:39,200
sheets and and the sea ice in terms of

888
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,239
the ice albedo feedback alone

889
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,000
um entirely then this could already lead

890
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,720
to additional global warming of roughly

891
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
0.2 degrees

892
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,399
celsius now that may not seem very much

893
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,679
but it certainly is important in the

894
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,840
grand scheme of things

895
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,480
as we're thinking of for instance the

896
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,039
paris range of 1.25 to 2 degrees

897
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,000
of warming every 10th of a degree

898
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,080
matters

899
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,440
so yeah very interesting question and

900
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,760
this is something that

901
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,200
has been done with numerical acid moles

902
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,840
just to understand

903
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,880
what kind of an effect these kind of

904
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,918
what-if

905
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,559
scenarios would have um also in terms of

906
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,559
the albedo

907
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,519
very interesting so should we now

908
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,360
started to develop drones who can spray

909
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,640
paint

910
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,959
that's a good question i don't think

911
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,720
that's the solution i think we have a

912
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,039
much better solution and

913
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,640
that is we know that we need to to

914
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:37,679
mitigate climate change

915
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,840
and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and

916
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,159
that is one that would work for sure

917
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,600
whereas these questions of well should

918
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,080
we spray paint

919
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,799
all of our buildings um at the at the

920
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,279
top

921
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,799
white that is something that cannot be

922
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,840
done at such a large

923
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:56,559
scale as we would need it in order to

924
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,799
reverse global warming and another thing

925
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,918
to keep in mind is that

926
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,279
even if we were able to reduce the

927
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,039
global signal

928
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,320
this still doesn't mean that we could

929
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,440
also reverse the

930
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:12,399
the regional scale changes

931
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,960
we're already experiencing a large

932
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,520
increase

933
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,000
in extreme weather and climate events

934
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,759
and and that is certainly something

935
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,280
that i haven't seen so far that this

936
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,879
could also be reversed

937
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,760
just by reversing the global mean

938
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,598
temperature change as a whole

939
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,960
answer i have another question i think

940
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,119
that's quite interesting

941
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,119
um how old is the oldest ice in

942
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,679
antarctica are you aware of that and

943
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,200
how long would it take a minimum to lose

944
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,320
that entirely

945
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,158
yeah very good question um so the oldest

946
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,879
ice there's actually an ongoing search

947
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,280
for the oldest eyes in antarctica so to

948
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,319
say

949
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,280
um we know that antarctica was ice-free

950
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,560
for the last time

951
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,919
roughly 34 million years ago so when

952
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,960
we're talking about these

953
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,359
scenarios that eventually antarctica

954
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,760
could

955
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,319
become ice-free with of course very

956
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,520
strong global warming scenarios of

957
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,599
about 10 degrees of global warming

958
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,400
then we need to keep in mind that this

959
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:13,920
was the case for the last time about 34

960
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,079
million years ago now as we're speaking

961
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,839
there is an ongoing

962
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,839
project an international collaboration

963
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,320
to find and and

964
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:24,000
also drill for the oldest eyes so that

965
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,720
we can really understand

966
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,800
our earth's history better and better

967
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,598
and so this is a very exciting

968
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,359
project because as i said the ice cores

969
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,240
are kind of like tree rings and we can

970
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,400
count back

971
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,520
in time and really understand what our

972
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,320
global climate was

973
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,440
like several hundreds of thousands of

974
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,240
years ago

975
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,320
and so yeah with with that being said um

976
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,640
i think it's important to keep in mind

977
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,359
that um this is something that humans

978
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,839
certainly have

979
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,880
never experienced and that's therefore

980
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:56,560
unprecedented

981
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,680
in our world for this a

982
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,320
very elaborate answer to this question i

983
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,520
know it is

984
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,760
not the uh core of your research

985
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,800
but someone from the internet asked if

986
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,079
it's possible

987
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,800
for old viruses and old bacteria from

988
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,960
back when antarctica was like like

989
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,359
beginning to freeze over or

990
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,119
from like millions of years ago is it

991
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,960
possible for them to thaw out again that

992
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,400
is that a danger for us

993
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,560
oh that's also a very interesting

994
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,880
question so i'm not no expert on this

995
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,359
but

996
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,920
i could imagine that at the temperatures

997
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,799
that we

998
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,520
have in antarctica so especially in the

999
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,000
core

1000
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,119
ice body there um we have temperatures

1001
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,960
that go down to

1002
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,880
well i think the coldest temperature was

1003
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,599
something like minus 90 degrees

1004
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,400
celsius that was recorded there but in

1005
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,400
any case it's very cold there so

1006
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,400
there might be some bacteria that can

1007
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,320
survive these conditions and

1008
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:54,880
i've read about bacteria like that but

1009
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,760
i wouldn't know that there are many um

1010
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,079
bacterial

1011
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,640
species or specimen that that could

1012
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,880
survive uh these kinds of conditions so

1013
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,160
um to be honest i i would have to read

1014
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,520
up on that that's a very interesting

1015
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,000
question

1016
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,280
so yeah thank you for this answer um i

1017
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
remember that you

1018
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,119
watched that you showed an animation and

1019
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,560
a graph

1020
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,480
for a simulated ice decline to find the

1021
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,279
tipping points in antarctica

1022
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,480
and on the x-axis of that i couldn't see

1023
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,119
a time scale

1024
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,880
and now someone asked on the internet

1025
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,040
what are the time scales between

1026
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,000
reaching a tipping point and most of the

1027
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,240
ice being

1028
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,040
melted is that years decades centuries

1029
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,000
millennia what's kind of the scale there

1030
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,279
yeah very important point um so it's

1031
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
important to note that

1032
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,760
we're here um showing this over the

1033
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,400
global mean temperature change

1034
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,320
and the reason for this is that the way

1035
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,359
these kinds of hysteresis experiments

1036
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,359
are run is that

1037
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,640
you have a very slow temperature

1038
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,598
increase um

1039
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,759
so slow in fact that it's much slower

1040
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,800
than the sort of internal

1041
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,119
time scales of the ice itself and in

1042
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,079
in this case for instance we had a

1043
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,200
temperature increase

1044
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:09,760
of um 10 to the minus 4 degrees

1045
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,879
per year um and the reason for this is

1046
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,440
because this is the way

1047
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,599
you're approaching and the actual

1048
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,160
hysteresis curve that we were interested

1049
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,960
in

1050
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,279
so this should not be mistaken for um

1051
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,680
for

1052
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,359
sea level projections um of any sort so

1053
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,520
what we find here

1054
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,359
are the actual so to say tipping points

1055
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,160
the actual critical thresholds

1056
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,960
um that parts of the antarctic ice you

1057
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,640
cannot

1058
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,720
survive nonetheless of course we're also

1059
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,920
working towards sea level projections

1060
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,319
and trying to understand

1061
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,160
what kind of sea level change we can

1062
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,839
expect from the ice sheets

1063
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,000
over the next decades to centuries to

1064
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:49,599
millennia

1065
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,640
and one important thing there is that

1066
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,560
most of the i most of the ice laws

1067
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,480
that could be triggered now would

1068
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,359
actually happen after the end of this

1069
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,960
century

1070
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,799
so very often when we see these sea

1071
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,480
level curves we're looking until the

1072
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,720
year

1073
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:08,000
2100 so for the next decades

1074
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,839
how does the sea level respond to

1075
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,160
changes in temperature because but

1076
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,960
because we have so much inertia

1077
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,359
in the system that means that even if

1078
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,400
the

1079
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:19,040
temperatures were that the global

1080
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,520
warming

1081
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,400
signal was stopped right now and we

1082
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,640
would still see

1083
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,640
continued sea level rise for several

1084
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,040
decades to centuries

1085
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,759
and that is something important to keep

1086
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,440
in mind so

1087
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,440
i think we really need to start thinking

1088
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,560
of sea level rise in terms of

1089
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,359
commitment rather than these

1090
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,960
short-term predictions that being said

1091
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,520
another important

1092
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,040
question and factor is the rate of sea

1093
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,759
level change because this is actually

1094
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,480
what we need

1095
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,240
to adapt to as civilizations when we

1096
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,160
think of building dams

1097
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,759
there are two questions we need to

1098
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,118
answer one is

1099
00:39:53,760 --> 00:40:00,560
the magnitude of of celebrities

1100
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,119
and also an upper scale and upper limit

1101
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,680
to that

1102
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,520
and the other question is the rate at

1103
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,240
which this changes

1104
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,640
and what we find is that on the long

1105
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,839
term

1106
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,640
there is something like 2.3 meters

1107
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,279
per degree of sea level change so this

1108
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,520
is

1109
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,160
um sort of a number to keep in mind when

1110
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,720
we think of these sea level projections

1111
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,078
and yeah i think it's really important

1112
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,879
to consider

1113
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,359
longer time scales than the one till the

1114
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,990
year 2100 when we talk about sea level

1115
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,920
rise

1116
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:34,879

1117
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,680
thank you for this answer is very

1118
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,200
interesting

1119
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,960
and we are out of time now so

1120
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,359
thanks for all the questions and thank

1121
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,359
you ricardo for this amazing talk

1122
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,200
the next talk on this stage will be

1123
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,240
about the related topic and measuring

1124
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,560
co2

1125
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,279
indoors but also in the atmosphere in

1126
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,359
general

1127
00:40:51,280 --> 00:41:07,839
but before that we have a harold news

1128
00:40:53,359 --> 00:41:07,839
show for you prepared so enjoy

1129
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,839
wow

1130
