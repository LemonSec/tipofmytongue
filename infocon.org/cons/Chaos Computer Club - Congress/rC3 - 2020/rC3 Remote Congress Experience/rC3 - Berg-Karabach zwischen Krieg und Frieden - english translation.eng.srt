00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:10,520
[Music]

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,520
[Applause]

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,359
okay

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,680
second trial sign is working

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,480
we're talking about nagorno-karabakh

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,359
between

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,359
war and peace

8
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,000
it's the mountainous black garden it's

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,440
what it's often called

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,559
in the caucasian region

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,040
and we have a conflict that's escalated

12
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,079
between

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:46,079
amina and azerbaijan

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:50,320
as many of you may have heard of

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,559
but the conflict goes back way farther

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,559
um

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,959
giving you a talk about the background

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,080
in the next 20 minutes

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,799
the talk is in german and there is

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,479
interpretation into english which you

21
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,600

25
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,600
sharing a screen

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,280

27
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,840

thank you for listening to me

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,959
thank you for the introduction um

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,120
today i want to talk to you about the

35
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,160
nagorno-karabakh

36
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,520
conflict um

37
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,920
as you said it's a region

38
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,879
of the internet that isn't very present

39
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,359
on international

40
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,160
agendas and hadn't been well known up

41
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,440
until this

42
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,480
year it's in southern in the southern

43
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,599
caucasian mountain region and it's

44
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,799
between

45
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,480
armenia and azerbaijan which are the

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,680
main conflicting parties

47
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,518
in this whole thing

48
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:02,840
and they are fighting about which region

49
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:05,840
um which country the region belongs to

50
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,840
um

51
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:22,000
why is there a conflict basically both

52
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,280
parties the region has um

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,319
a high meaning for

54
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,080
culture and identity

55
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:35,440
yeah but there's also a

56
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,000
very prominent ethnical level to that

57
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,000
conflict

58
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:50,480
appears in the media it's more about

59
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,560
a fight about the region rather than a

60
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,200
fight in the region

61
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,959
you may have heard that in september to

62
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,200
november

63
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:06,640
there had been military

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,640
incidents that escalated towards a war

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,560
which took about 5

66
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,918
000 lives but you have to be

67
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,680
careful with the numbers i would like to

68
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,680
bring some visibility and some

69
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:29,840
transparency into that

70
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,840
conflict and the last 26 years

71
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,240
in recent years the risk of conflict has

72
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,759
heightened because

73
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,600
of increasing militarization and the

74
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:47,680
eu has a partnership treaty with

75
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,680
armenia and connections to azerbaijan

76
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,080
because of energy

77
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,080
supply

78
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,639
i think it could have been more present

79
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,440
in the media for myself

80
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,360
because the media representation only

81
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,680
touches the surface

82
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,440
which is of course because the conflict

83
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,919
is very

84
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,919
complex

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,880
i split my presentation into three parts

86
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,638
at the beginning we will look at the

87
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:34,320
players that are involved stakeholders

88
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,120
in the conflict we'll talk about the

89
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,840
positions

90
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:42,320
of both parties but also how

91
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:45,119
nagorno-karabakh is positioned as a de

92
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,159
facto state

93
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,080
i'll come back to that later

94
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,680
and of course we'll talk about the

95
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,159
international stakeholders such as

96
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,960
russia

97
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,319
and turkey as well and in international

98
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,680
organizations

99
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,680
who are involved

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,840
in the second part i would like to

101
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,840
present the

102
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
economic

103
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,039
and how they impact the conflict and the

104
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,880
last part will be about the peace

105
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:26,560
negotiations

106
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,919
in the night from the 9th to the 10th

107
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,960
november this year

108
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,960
a peace treaty was

109
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,400
but signed still very far away from

110
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,160
peace

111
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,679
so what uh the obstacles

112
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,840
we're going to look at the obstacles

113
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,840
towards peace

114
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,560
like how the region is split between the

115
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,599
two countries

116
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:10,160
and fighting over it i brought you a map

117
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,680
what you're seeing here is southern

118
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,880
caucasus

119
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,880
which includes armenia azerbaijan

120
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:30,479
and russia is also closed

121
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:33,520
in 1991 when the ussr collapsed

122
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,080
international structures were affected

123
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,758
as well

124
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,758
and of course um nagorno-karabakh was

125
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:44,560
affected as well because knee states

126
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:47,120
were created near borders to adorn

127
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,639
not only armenia and azerbaijan became

128
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,800
independent but also

129
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:56,240
other um former ussr countries

130
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,440
um so the yellow

131
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:03,120
region which you see on the left side

132
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:06,240
that is the region that was given to

133
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:11,120
armenia back then and

134
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,120
the white territory was given to

135
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,800
azerbaijan that includes the yellow

136
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,160
white

137
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,000
striped region and the blue um the

138
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,599
region bordered in blue

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,960
so that was all azerbaijan

140
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,520
at that point so that was what we

141
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,638
started with that was before the war

142
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,039
started

143
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:37,039
this war lasted for three years until

144
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,039
1997.

145
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,800
um a little older but nothing

146
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,800
nothing much has changed since

147
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,800
since then um

148
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,839
armenia took some of the

149
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
regions

150
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:23,839
[Music]

151
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,839
was also um held by the military

152
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:31,200
and we had about 20 000 to 30

153
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,399
000 casualties which is of course

154
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,920
a very vague number but

155
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,720
you have to be careful with numbers and

156
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,279
still um historical evaluation has to be

157
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,680
done

158
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:47,120
before we know the exact numbers and

159
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,120
also people were displaced

160
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,120
from the azerbaijani

161
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:11,279
agreements in 1994 that also

162
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,279
um attributed the region to azerbaijan

163
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,640
and then we also have the

164
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,760
um ceasefire line

165
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,760
which is very important

166
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,839
what was agreed on in the ceasefire

167
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,599
agreements

168
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,000
hasn't changed much

169
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,040
the positions haven't changed and also

170
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,399
the interests haven't changed

171
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:47,760
so this is all still applicable to

172
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:50,160
today's conflict

173
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,959
the region has declared independence but

174
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,560
it is

175
00:10:50,959 --> 00:11:00,000
under armenian regulation

176
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,000
and um is part of the armenian

177
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:10,720
we haven't really elaborated on

178
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,720
why the conflict has arisen once again

179
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,600
you could say that the conflict just

180
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,800
hasn't been resolved

181
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:26,240
because no solution that both sides

182
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,240
would be satisfied with have been found

183
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,839
of course

184
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:49,839
they are very very different politically

185
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,959
but also institutionally

186
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:56,000
and culturally on the left you

187
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:59,439
see president aliyev from

188
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,399
azerbaijan who's been president since

189
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,440
2003

190
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,959
and on the right you see the armenian

191
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,480
prem prime minister pacinian

192
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,638
who is has been prime minister since

193
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,839
2008

194
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:20,399
comparing the two political systems they

195
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:24,399
both um they are presidential systems

196
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:29,040
and we've had four changes of power

197
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:32,720
in armenia since 1994

198
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:36,240
we had corruption conflicts

199
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,040
when looking at azerbaijan in contrast

200
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,040
jan is

201
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,319
lies within the hands of the president

202
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,839
the parliament doesn't really have much

203
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,399
power

204
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:02,800
and influence um in 2020

205
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,440
we had a new opposition candidate in the

206
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,439
parliament

207
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,639
so in 2017 this family rule was

208
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,639
increased

209
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:53,359
this goes back a long time to 1969

210
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,440
and in that respect azerbaijan is

211
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,399
different armenia has progressed much

212
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,240
more

213
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:03,920
also domestic problems in

214
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:07,040
azerbaijan media freedom freedom of the

215
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,560
judiciary a lot to be wished for so

216
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,160
reporters with the borders

217
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,239
have placed azerbaijan on rank 168 of

218
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,560
180

219
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,480
states in terms of press freedom so

220
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,638
that's not very good

221
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,639
and armenian comparison is on rank 60.

222
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,040
a large percentage of the media are

223
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,880
state-owned

224
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:34,079
and in foreign policy armenia

225
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,760
is trying to gain

226
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:39,680
recognition from europe and other areas

227
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,199
they have joined the eurasian economic

228
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,160
union

229
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,359
but still armenia is very much

230
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,160
interested in close

231
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,279
relations with the european union and a

232
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,680
partnership

233
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:56,839
agreement was signed agreeing on

234
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,839
economic cooperation and strengthening

235
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
that

236
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,720
a foreign policy that appeals to

237
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,519
democratic rights

238
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,519
i would regard

239
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,479
more as a problem and azerbaijan is not

240
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,920
really responding to criticism

241
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,959
on any problems

242
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:30,079
it has such as human rights journalists

243
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:32,319
rights and they say we don't have to be

244
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,199
criticized we are an important economic

245
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,560
factor

246
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,560
in this region which is true

247
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,439
and domestically what is done

248
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,959
is that criticisms are

249
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,639
associated in a very dramatic in

250
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,119
a way that is very typical of autocratic

251
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,680
regimes criticism is associated

252
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,720
with other problems such as territorial

253
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,120
conflicts

254
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,320
the unsolved one that we are talking

255
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,759
about

256
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,560
or they are just blaming on the armenian

257
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,000
diaspora

258
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,479
abroad causing frictions

259
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,360
so let's look back on the map and

260
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,880
western media

261
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,399
like to talk about nagono karabakh as

262
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,880
in a region of azerbaijan which is

263
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,079
occupied by armenia that is all quite

264
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,040
a grey area and in terms of

265
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,800
international law

266
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,560
that is it's true it is a part of

267
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,880
azerbaijan but in the last 20 years a

268
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,479
lot has changed

269
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,959
it's true that armenia occupied these

270
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,839
areas

271
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,839
in contravention of international law

272
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,800
even then through its referendum made

273
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,600
very clear that they didn't want to be

274
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:53,279
part of azerbaijan anymore

275
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,480
so we have two principles here that are

276
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,800
kind of in conflict

277
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,320
on the one hand there is the principle

278
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,399
of territorial integrity

279
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,639
integrity and on the other there is

280
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,919
self-determination

281
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,160
which is the right of every people so um

282
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,079
for them to be able to say we would no

283
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,880
longer be part of azerbaijan that is a

284
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,399
right

285
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,120
so these are the problems that are in

286
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:19,839
conflict here and de facto you could say

287
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,839
that nagono karabakh is

288
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,160
but realistically this region is

289
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,840
financed through

290
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,799
subsidies from armenia and the armenian

291
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,600
diaspora

292
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,360
and they have made huge steps in the

293
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,120
last few years in terms of their

294
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,479
economic and political

295
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,039
development but by law if you look at

296
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,799
international law that is not the case

297
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:53,760
so the question of course is what is

298
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:55,679
really and this unresolved status

299
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,960
which is very hard to understand and i

300
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,840
hope i haven't been

301
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,840
talking too widely here that doesn't

302
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,360
only lead to a very precarious security

303
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,120
situation

304
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,520
along the contact line the ceasefire

305
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,879
line which is a very militarized area

306
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,600
you have snipers there we used to have

307
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,919
them there

308
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,799
facing each other from both sides and

309
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,960
that of course

310
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:22,480
makes it harder for international actors

311
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,360
and for it makes it harder to organize

312
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,440
help

313
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:30,240
internationally for both states this is

314
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:34,080
an undivisible region

315
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,480
indivisible and it's very hard to find

316
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,320
any kind of compromise but it would take

317
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,240
a compromise from both sides

318
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,559
and of course the issue of instability

319
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,600
on both sides is that

320
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,639
so any kind of peace process has very

321
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,439
little chance of surviving politically

322
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,280
which is what we see at the moment the

323
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,320
outcome of the war has created a

324
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,200
political crisis

325
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,240
in armenia the opposition is demanding

326
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,480
the resignation

327
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,799
of the government and new elections so

328
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,240
this is a very difficult

329
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,080
situation and if

330
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,559
you think that this isn't complicated

331
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,960
enough let's go back one step

332
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,120
because what i've just explained is the

333
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,679
conflict between armenia and azerbaijan

334
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,520
about the region of nigeria what we

335
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,919
haven't looked at yet is the involvement

336
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,389
of international actors

337
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,280
so a level higher if you want um

338
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:30,000
[Music]

339
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,000
so russia

340
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,639
established itself as an independent

341
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:39,840
broker

342
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,840
or negotiator and uh

343
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,559
we should say that russia would have

344
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,440
preferred to be the only negotiator

345
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,280
their relationship

346
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,200
to both these states is very complex on

347
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,399
the one hand they have strategic

348
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,520
relationships with

349
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,000
armenia and traditionally they have been

350
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,000
allies

351
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,559
military stability in the region but

352
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,158
they do support armenia militarily as

353
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,799
well and they're not exerting any

354
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,280
pressure

355
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,320
on armenia to withdraw from the regions

356
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,520
they've occupied

357
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,080
um so on the one hand

358
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,158
russia is strengthening the armenian

359
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,320
position but on the other hand they are

360
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,760
supplying arms to azerbaijan so it's a

361
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,639
very ambivalent role that they're

362
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,440
playing

363
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,280
and on the rhetorical level they are

364
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,720
supporting the territorial integrity of

365
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,360
azerbaijan

366
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,360
which is which means that the support

367
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,440
the fact that the opinion that it is

368
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,120
part of

369
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:00,880
armenian sovereignty is uh not really

370
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,120
there and russia

371
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,120
maybe

372
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,520
as long as the stationing of russian

373
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,879
peace

374
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,679
troops in the region would be involved

375
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,039
they don't don't want to lose influence

376
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,320
on the region's complete underreaching

377
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,559
completely but

378
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,240
they're not really getting involved in

379
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,840
not applying any pressure there hasn't

380
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,120
been a peace agreement

381
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,240
in these 26 years that is a long time

382
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,760
it's not that there haven't been any

383
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,480
suggestions or proposals

384
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,400
and various communications have been

385
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,039
tried

386
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,000
all these have then kind of stopped

387
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,200
being used

388
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,559
and broken off in time and russia

389
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,559
doesn't want to

390
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,678
spoil its relationship with azerbaijan

391
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,639
completely

392
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,640
so on the one hand

393
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,320
they have the aspiration to be

394
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,639
a dominant force in the region but they

395
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,760
don't want to get involved too much

396
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,610
um so

397
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,879
um

398
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:11,600
[Music]

399
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,520
weren't able to guarantee any more than

400
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,039
the continuation of the ceasefire

401
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,240
agreement so far

402
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,520
so we have no war situation we haven't

403
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,760
had any full-blown war

404
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,720
in the last few years but no real peace

405
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,760
either

406
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,640
there have always been conflicts on the

407
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,158
ceasefire line that have escalated and

408
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,240
now it gets even more complicated

409
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,080
because since 2016

410
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,280
we have to deal with the involvement of

411
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,280
turkey as well the

412
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,918
ceasefire line let's go back to the

413
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,918
earlier map

414
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,159
earlier but in 2016 that changed

415
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,200
next to any smaller clashes nothing much

416
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,200
happened

417
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,039
[Music]

418
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,840
we're not going to take back the

419
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,840
occupied regions by force

420
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,158
and i think it's the number of

421
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,000
casualties that

422
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,520
arose which brought it back onto the

423
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,480
agenda

424
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,360
what also was completely new is that

425
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,640
turkey's

426
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,520
involvement in conflict caused a very

427
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,000
new geopolitical situation

428
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,600
[Music]

429
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,120
so turkey wants to get involved in the

430
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,439
region which

431
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,239
is connected to azerbaijan's new foreign

432
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,640
policy

433
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,640
they want to establish ties with turkey

434
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,039
with erdogan

435
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,679
and what does this cooperation look like

436
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,760
in

437
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,760
what sense does turkey get involved and

438
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,200
how do they support azerbaijan were they

439
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,200
supply arms

440
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:12,080
they are conducting military exercises

441
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,000
on azerbaijani territory and through

442
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,760
turkish support of course there is an

443
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,279
enormous change in the position of

444
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,840
azerbaijan

445
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,679
in in 2018 and 2019 things were

446
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:26,240
relatively quiet

447
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,240
the issues could be resolved osce

448
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,480
called for more cooperation and peace

449
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,360
negotiations the ceasefire was back in

450
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,400
place

451
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:37,199
but now we get to the year 2020 and

452
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,200
things the tide is turning again with

453
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,039
the clashes from the 12th to the 16th of

454
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,320
july

455
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,960
with an artery bombardment

456
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,399
17 people died and the political

457
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,679
repercussions were strong there were

458
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,600
demonstrations in parkour the

459
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,400
azerbaijani capital and

460
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,399
calling for war

461
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,120
both sides blamed each other for

462
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,840
starting the conflict

463
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,000
and azerbaijan was strengthened through

464
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:10,559
rising world market prices

465
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,600
on fuel falling prices

466
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,600
got them into a crisis

467
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
the

468
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,840
and approached the armenian border which

469
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,918
was kind of shocking but not really

470
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,678
surprising

471
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:57,840
um because the relations between the two

472
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:57,840
states never really improved

473
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,039
without protection against the advancing

474
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,760
troops

475
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,520
and within the first week a lot of

476
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,559
damage was done

477
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:17,200
and the 11th of august 11th

478
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,200
the 8th of november was a turning point

479
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,320
when a historically important place was

480
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,919
taken

481
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,559
and the bloody clashes went on for six

482
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,919
weeks now

483
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,918
but that was actually

484
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,039
the point when well perhaps not armenia

485
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:38,640
that much but

486
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,480
at least noticed that no within the next

487
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,600
few days

488
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,039
there will be no ceasefire agreement

489
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:50,320
because the capital will be

490
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,320
occupied within a few days

491
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,000
and finally in the november on the 9th

492
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,679
of the 9th to the 10th of november

493
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,279
an agreement was negotiated and signed

494
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,520
with involvement by putin and at the

495
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:07,520
time i handed in my concept paper

496
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,520
that ceasefire

497
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,880
went into regions that were settled by

498
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,760
armenian

499
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,200
people what was the reaction on your

500
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,279
international side

501
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,200
not much there were calls

502
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,679
for peace negotiations or ceasefire

503
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,240
negotiations

504
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,760
and turkey physically and militarily was

505
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,869
involved

506
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,869
[Music]

507
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,158
this is a map of the region after the

508
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,559
war

509
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,520
but i'll show you that again later it's

510
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,520
a bit too much now

511
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:16,000
we're getting ahead to closing time

512
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,639
let's look at the economic performance

513
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,159
of

514
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:24,080
the two states when looking at the

515
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:27,279
war and how it went how did economic

516
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:30,799

518
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,960
when looking at statistics that the

519
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,720
economic development

520
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,919
of armenia this is the um gross domestic

product

522
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:47,039
went up in both

523
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:50,480
states there was a crisis

524
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,879
and um of course uh the crisis in 2008

525
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,399
had an

526
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,440
impact and

527
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:00,639
in 2014 there were also um

528
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:05,130
there was a great slump because of

529
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:08,000
um price levels

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,840

532
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,840
impact

533
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:22,639
because um both states are

534
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:25,679
taking um well are exporting

535
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,080
resources from the caspian sea let's

536
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,480
look

537
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:32,799
at let's overlay both

538
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,840
curves and you can see that the

539
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,360
dimensions

540
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,360
are very diverse

541
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,840
much more dependent on russia they don't

542
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,880
have

543
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:48,240
um as much

544
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,679
resources as azerbaijan so they are very

545
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,000
much dependent

546
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:58,399
azerbaijan has pipelines

547
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,760
example the uh southern gas corridor

548
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:05,039
i don't know i don't know which the eu

549
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:08,720
is trying to use as a new um

550
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:12,720
energy supply and this also fuels

551
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,360
your europe's stake in

552
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,480
the conflict so let's look at the

553
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,719
military

554
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:24,480
expenses in comparison to the

555
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,480
gross domestic products

556
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,200
when looking at the gdp

557
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:40,799
they have very high relative

558
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,799
military costs

559
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,840
is even ahead of azerbaijan there in

560
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:51,840
2019

561
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,840
when looking at the nato conflict

562
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:59,279
the member states can't agree on

563
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,678
two percent and here we have like five

564
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,960
or

565
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:05,679
four or six percent still

566
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,799
militarily they're not very well

567
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,960
equipped

568
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:14,700
why because um there are

569
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,760
exports russia is exporting

00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,799
[Music]

571
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:22,080
weapons to both states but

572
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:24,960
in 2014 azerbaijan

573
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,158
tried to diversify their sources they

574
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,960
negotiated with

575
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,840
israel and was equipped by israel

576
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,840
whereas

577
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
armenia

578
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,559
because international stakeholders such

579
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,600
as turkey

580
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:54,240
israel and other states but

581
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:57,039
also european states are supporting

582
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,039
azerbaijan

583
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:07,039
that has increased the safety

um conflicts

585
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:15,840
of troubles so i tried to do an

586
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:15,840
intermediary conclusion

587
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,880
is likely to recover faster and better

588
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,879
from the war and

589
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,519
i haven't considered the pandemics and

590
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:37,679
the military costs

591
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:42,799
so i think that they will both

592
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,799
be very much impacted thus

593
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,840
looking at war crimes

594
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,240
and azerbaijan are accusing each other

595
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,279
of reaching

596
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,279
international law

597
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:15,120
in international law

598
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:18,240
you can't do everything in war

599
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,199
so for example you can't um bomb

600
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,880
civilian

601
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,919
institutions or infrastructure

602
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:29,120
naturally um

603
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:32,159
there are regulations on how to treat

604
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,158
prisoners of war

605
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:43,199
international in organizations and ngos

606
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:45,439
have difficulty reaching the region

607
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,640
both countries making are making it

608
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,279
difficult for them

609
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,279
to help

610
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,000
because it's just been one and a half

611
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,640
months

612
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,440
so also because of the pandemic

613
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,640
international

614
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,519
help is only very slowly

615
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,519
reaching the region

616
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:12,719
so it's relatively certain that

617
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:16,879
azerbaijan has used a type of landmines

618
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:19,918
cluster bombs and also

619
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,879
the exchange of prisoners of war you are

620
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,839
seeing

621
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,799
very shocking pictures on the web at the

622
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,759
moment

623
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,040
of um prisoners being abused and of

624
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,000
course the states

625
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,719

626
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,239
abusing

627
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:38,879
and torturing prisoners of war

628
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,879
there are

629
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:46,720
reports of beheadings

630
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:49,279
so a lot is still uncertain

631
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,279
and hasn't

632
00:34:53,599 --> 00:35:00,160
it's also uncertain how many people are

633
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,160
currently prisoners of war

634
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,880
authorities are talking about a few

635
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,640
dozen

636
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,400
and other organizations are talking

637
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,359
about several hundred

638
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,580
prisoners so you have to be careful with

639
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,000
the numbers

important

692
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,919
war

693
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:14,480
and yet the celebrations in azerbaijan

694
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:17,680
are typical for authoritarian regimes

695
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,119
so let's come to our conclusion i hope

696
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,359
that i haven't lost

697
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:26,400
too many um spectators

698
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:29,598
i'll be quick so i'll

699
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:33,520
just um quickly sum it up

700
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:35,839
it's a complicated conflict

701
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,240
what are the problems that are resulting

702
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,240
from that

703
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,480
and why am i even talking about it

704
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:49,949
[Music]

705
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:59,680
the conflict shows how

706
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,680
foreign policies are being negotiated

707
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,078
their stakeholders having their own

708
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,079
interests

709
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:13,040
russia um did a very half-assed job

710
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,680
it was somewhere between stabilization

711
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,799
and control of the region

712
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,799
whereas turkey

713
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:28,500
[Music]

714
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,240
exactly sensitive about politico

715
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:53,839
russia hasn't been very active although

716
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:56,720
personally i believe they would have had

717
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,720
the potential

718
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,760
but they at least managed not to

719
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,118
create any further conflicts with the

720
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,599
parties

721
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,599
involved

722
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,480
i'm pretty sure that russia will

723
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:19,040
not accept turkey's influence or

724
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,480
is annoyed about turkey's influence

725
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:25,279
because turkey is

726
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:28,640
still trying to gain influence

727
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:33,520
and they claim that they had deployed

728
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:35,520
um peace troops whereas um

729
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,520
while russian peace troops are deployed

730
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,720
at the same time putin wouldn't

731
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:44,960
accept that so

732
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,959
with the political instabilities

733
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,240
we've talked about

734
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:02,800
and also it's very difficult to

735
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:05,200
see what is even happening

736
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,319
because the stakes are pretty

737
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,480
complicated and

738
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:13,759
diverse the statistical economic

739
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:17,839
statistics are also

740
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,839
an important facet

741
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:24,960
[Music]

742
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,040
because these statistics do not really

743
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,880
tell you who is actually benefiting from

744
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,800
any economic growth

745
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,040
i've seen a statistic recently that

746
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,119
poverty rates in azerbaijan

747
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,880
are supposed to be about five percent

748
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,839
which i

749
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,800
think as is regarded somewhat mysterious

750
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:46,400
and the eu

751
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,880
lastly has to be viewed very critically

752
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,880
because

753
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:55,440
as usual they claim to be following the

754
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,560
principles of the rule of law

755
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:03,680
and armenia in the course of

756
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,680
this partnership of course has committed

757
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,359
close to the european union and was

758
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:09,359
ready to do that but in this

759
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,640
at the same time some member states are

760
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,880
actually contributing

761
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,520
to the militarization of that region

762
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:19,119
arms exports are a huge problem

763
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:22,960
and the worst in my view is the

764
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,560
inactivity that we see

765
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,319
the fact that nothing's been done

766
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,920
although it has to be said

767
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:29,759
that the eu doesn't really have any

768
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,880
levers

769
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,640
to pull in this region which tells you

770
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,839
once again that the eu is not a really

771
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,680
strong actor in foreign policy

772
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,520
there are other options other than just

773
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,799
ignoring this conflict

774
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,960
i'm not an expert myself but

775
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,440
i believe that in particular in

776
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,760
particular the people on the ground

777
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,760
would be

778
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,520
if grateful conflict would reach the

779
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,880
political agenda or they are grateful

780
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,040
that it has

781
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,000
but at the end of the day if this only

782
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,920
leads

783
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,480
to autocratic regimes only expanding

784
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,079
their sphere of influence and becoming

785
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,800
more active

786
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,920
but as we've seen with turkey and syria

787
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,960
and so on

788
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,240
that is not desirable so that's it for

789
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,079
me

790
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,078
thank you for your attention

791
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,919
we have a few questions from the

792
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:39,440
audience

793
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,880
there is much interest about your

794
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,520
background

795
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,040
and your motivation to get involved in

796
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,560
this conflict

797
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:52,240
well that's a good question

798
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:54,400
it's been during my studies that i

799
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:58,240
became very much aware of

800
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:00,960
this my bachelor thesis was about kosovo

801
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,200
which of course is another case of a de

802
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,079
facto independent state

803
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,000
with international recognition i think

804
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,440
kosovo has

805
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,040
about 100 states that have

806
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,040
diplomatically recognized them

807
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,140
isn't that lucky it's not as simple for

808
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,640
them

809
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:23,759
[Music]

810
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,759
and wow

811
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:29,359
it's sad to see much more could have

812
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,240
been done to protect the people on the

813
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:33,920
ground

814
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:37,759
from such conflict yeah

815
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:40,770
and another question

816
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,000
is about the drone program

817
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:45,440
[Music]

818
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,560
you've shown that the gross domestic

819
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,839
product

820
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:53,200
really broke down and the question was

821
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:54,480
how does azerbaijan finance its drone

822
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,520
program

823
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,839
if you have information on that at all

824
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,359
which drone program are you talking

825
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:05,359
about the

826
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:07,040
purchase of military equipment

827
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:09,839
yes these are military drones aren't

828
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:13,279
they orbiter

829
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:16,640
is something that you read about

830
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:21,280
yeah true well firstly i am not

831
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,279
an arms expert in any way but

832
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,119
that's always a foreign policy issue

833
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,960
what you purchase and what you do not

834
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:30,079
purchase

835
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:33,520
and if you are in a region that is

836
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:35,599
quite unstable

837
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,680
not just between armenia and azerbaijan

838
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,319
but also in the south you have iran and

839
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:43,200
you have the

840
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:43,200
near east the thinking

841
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:00,240
and you don't know with such autocratic

842
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,160
regimes i think it's

843
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,319
difficult to say i don't specifically

844
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:07,598
know where these drones came from

845
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:09,759
but i believe that there was a lot of

846
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,920
funds being diverted because the whole

847
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,640
economic sector

848
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,079
in azerbaijan they have a certain civil

849
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,759
servant oligarchy

850
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:21,119
and the state and the economy are

851
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,119
working hand in hand really

852
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,280
the question really was about if during

853
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,720
your research

854
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:32,480
you saw any other financial sources

855
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:34,640
being used because in your graphics

856
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,000
it was quite explicit that money is

857
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,078
getting less

858
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,520
so the question was where did the money

859
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,400
for rather expensive

860
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,880
arms come from and maybe you could have

861
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,440
seen something

862
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,319
yes of course but i would only have to

863
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,559
speculate

864
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:54,640
and could you find out from where these

865
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:57,920
drones were controlled because

866
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,960
azerbaijan allegedly does not have the

867
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,160
resources

868
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:07,839
to actually carry out such operations

869
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,839
that is a good question

870
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,839
no sorry i could only speculate i'm not

871
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:16,720
going to

872
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:17,920
cause any start any false rumors i don't

873
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,040
know

874
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,559
yeah okay thank you to that

875
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,640
up to that point and then there are

876
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:27,839
several exclaves

877
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,200
and one question is about the effects of

878
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:32,000
the exclave

879
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,240
of nakichewan do you know anything about

880
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,240
that

881
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,300
how it looks in that region

882
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:40,300
[Music]

883
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,000
is anything happening in these in that

884
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,680
exclave

885
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,720
how do the people in that region react

886
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:54,399
respond are there any

887
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:56,000
tendencies to occupy these so i'm just

888
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,760
asking very naively because i'm not

889
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,200
informed that

890
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:04,240
is the question and the other exclave a

891
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,240
smaller one called

892
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:10,720
i don't know how it's pronounced again

893
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,160
the question is

894
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:16,480
how if you have any information about

895
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,319
is it disputed what is going to happen

896
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,599
in your view

897
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,960
yeah from the armenian side i do not see

898
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,720
any tendency

899
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:28,559
to continue operating

900
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,640
militarily that is something i can

901
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:33,760
definitely say

902
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:36,160
regarding the exclave specifically i

903
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,839
can't say i have no information i would

904
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:42,160
have to look again

905
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:45,520
okay yeah thank you another question

906
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:50,240
about georgia do you know anything about

907
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:55,280
their position in this conflict how they

908
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:55,279
acting um yes yeah

909
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,599
[Music]

910
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:03,440
georgia

911
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:05,040
i would have to get deep into that

912
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,960
that would take us a bit too far all

913
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:11,599
right i understand that

914
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,599
so that is difficult at this point okay

915
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:30,799
is that the fact is that a factor that

916
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,119
is leading the responses from any other

917
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,119
states

918
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,919
no no no no i don't believe no

919
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,839
i don't believe

920
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,200
they could have acted much stronger in

921
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,599
sanctioned turkey

922
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,799
for getting involved in this conflict i

923
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,720
hope that answers the questions

924
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:06,640
otherwise i haven't really understood it

925
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,640
yes thank you um

926
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,480
were talking about nakichiwan shortly

927
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,920
and then we have a

928
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:17,040
further clarification in that question

929
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,040
the accord

930
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,000
does it include a corridor and are there

931
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,879
any

932
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,319
changes there or a previous accord does

933
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,559
include that which record are you

934
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:32,079
talking about

935
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:33,280
i really haven't looked at the exclaves

936
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,800
i don't know

937
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:40,319
i've only taken a very broad look and

938
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:43,520
the latching corridor is agreed on

939
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,520
but i don't know about any other

940
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,839
corridors

941
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:29,460
[Music]

942
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:47,839
ah

943
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,160
you
