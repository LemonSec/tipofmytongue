live from the rcp hi

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,600
my name is

[Music]

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,279
i work as a consultant for global health

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,320
at the frankfurt ngo medical

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,599
international

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,040
and i will be talking about how politics

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,920
and pharma companies prevent fair access

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,399
to covet

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:41,440
vaccinations let me

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,559
quickly talk about medical international

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,360
medical was founded in 1968

16
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,680
in frankfurt with the aim to provide

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,760
medical emergency services

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,640
and aid during catastrophes and you can

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,000
see some pictures already

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:02,160
in the mid 1970s medical shifts

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,080
its focus onto politics going away from

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,080
exporting drugs and putting a spot

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,880
to how drug pricing works

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,479
and the role the pharma industry plays

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,640
in that process

26
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:21,840
since then medical advocates for

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:25,439
changing unhealthy living situations

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,280
and today supports project partners in

29
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,158
more than 40 countries

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,159
worldwide

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,360
sporting effort replaced by long-term

32
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,039
support of local project partners

33
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,240
supported by campaign efforts that

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,000
initially were very critical of the

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,960
pharma industry unless we arrived at the

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,960
topic of this talk

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
nairobi

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,160
on the first picture you can see

39
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,920
ethiopian workers that work

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,480
as domestic workers in nairobi and

41
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,839
who have been sitting on the streets or

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,679
living on the street since the major

43
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,720
explosion and waiting for the return

44
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,319
home

45
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,640
all the while being very exposed to the

46
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,079
virus

47
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,119
you can see an impression of

48
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,160
nairobi slum the kenyan

49
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,800
capital many there

50
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,560
are this is also a picture from nairobi

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,840
r2.2

52
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,959
get good quality masks

53
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,640
this is an image from moria the refugee

54
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,599
camp on the greek islands

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,599
on lesbos

56
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,800
not just since the fire they were

57
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,000
very exposed to the virus because the

58
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,440
health care provided isn't sufficient

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,959
and they definitely won't be among the

60
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,959
first to receive the vaccination

61
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,760
this last image shows the palestinian

62
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:23,359
refugee camp in beirut

63
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,840
no one is saved from covet 19 until

64
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,400
everyone is safe from it this is an

65
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,840
insight that we probably all share

66
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,000
including german federal president

67
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,920
steinmeier

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,239
who emphasized it during his speech

69
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,399
before the world health organization wha

70
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,879
even anyone who defeats covet within

71
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,560
their own national borders

72
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,840
will be jailed within them if it's not

73
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,840
defeated everywhere

74
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:56,879
the newly appointed eu council president

75
00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:00,159
also says that the vaccination is our

76
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,159
universal property like

77
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,519
and stresses the universal right to

78
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,439
health

79
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,239
that means the deliverance from the

80
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:12,400
virus necessitates a global effort

81
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,959
and no one will honestly oppose that

82
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,959
there's just one

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,320
already secured more than half of the

84
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,880
vaccine that had yet to be produced the

85
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,479
rich

86
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,960
nations have already reserved

87
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,280
more than 5 billion doses of the

88
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,239
successful vaccine candidates

89
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,840
while only a small percentage of them is

90
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,840
available for the poorer countries

91
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,560
you can see this here if you take a look

92
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,159
at the map

93
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,960
if you look at europe

94
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,520
you see europe and the usa and other

95
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,280
industrial nations

96
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,400
they will be among the first to have

97
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,479
access to the vaccine

98
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,359
yeah now continues

99
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,000
and the poorest countries many among

100
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,120
them

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,680
from africa will probably among the last

102
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,080
to gain

103
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,080
access

104
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,919
if you look at the policy making

105
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,080
decisions

106
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:46,719
quickly becomes obvious that the

107
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,719
industrialized nations still stick to a

108
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,280
near liberal policy

109
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,280
that puts the right to profits

110
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,080
ahead of the human right especially the

111
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,758
fair access to the vaccine

112
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,479
that means this order of inequality is

113
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,880
being defended with all available force

114
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,639
which

115
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,639
you can take somewhat literally

116
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,440
this struggle for access to the upcoming

117
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,639
vaccines

118
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,680
shows you how the crisis is supposed to

119
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,639
be solved

120
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,479
i.e by taking advantage of the poor that

121
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,960
side effects will be deadly and will

122
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,400
lead to a sharp increase in

123
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,120
economical and social inequalities

124
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,080
and increase in poverty and certain

125
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,759
diseases

126
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,479
that cannot be treated sufficiently

127
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,000
anymore like hiv aids malaria and many

128
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:49,039
others

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,039
that means there will be a

130
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,440
divide in north and south even though

131
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,759
this

132
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,120
is supposed to be abolished if you

133
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,400
listen to

134
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,759
sunday's speeches there are no

135
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,960
there's no of alternatives a short while

136
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,599
ago the governments of

137
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,599
india and south africa have petitioned

138
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,319
so the world trade organization not the

139
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,039
who

140
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,039
or an exception to the trips agreement

141
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,880
agreement regulates or governs patents

142
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,960
and trade related aspects of

143
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,960
international property

144
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,960
the two governments argued

145
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,800
a comprehensive suspension of patent

146
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,000
regulations until the global population

147
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,360
has reached immunity

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,199
against the virus this

149
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,000
chips treaty which is still

150
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,000
controversial

151
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,360
it concluded in 95 at the initiative of

152
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,559
industrialized nations and international

153
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,000
companies

154
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,080
interestingly also pfizer which was one

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,479
of the manufacturers of the covet 19

156
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,479
vaccine

157
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,318
but there's also other companies that

158
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,440
are better known in the

159
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:18,800
world of chaos like ibm hp

160
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,440
and microsoft and

161
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,039
especially microsoft is important

162
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,400
because

163
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,560
for something that i want to explain

164
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,638
later

165
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,039
one of the companies with which the bill

166
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,799
and melinda gates foundation

167
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,799
generates its capital

168
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,320
which is also very important in the

169
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,200
realm of the

170
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,479
global health the explicit goal of the

171
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,640
trips agreement

172
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:50,800
was to um

173
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,800
to secure the patents against public

174
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
interests

175
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,000
the global concern that the global south

176
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,600
was

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,600
already uttering back then

178
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
provides

179
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,839
imports and thus bypassing patent

180
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,760
protection

181
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,480
the waiver that was proposed by south

182
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,480
africa in india

183
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
um

184
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,959
and it's clear that we have an

185
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,680
exceptional situation now

186
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,479
since it's obviously a global crisis

187
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,839
regarding

188
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,839
the help and then

189
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,429
[Music]

190
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,079
supply with affordable medical products

191
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,880
and that's

192
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,880
the production

193
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,439
that have the same ingredients but not

194
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,720
the same brand name

195
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,519
and are thus a lot cheaper than the

196
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,839
original

197
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,839
drugs

198
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,200
in the interest of um poorer countries

199
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,518
it's a great idea that the two countries

200
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,519
had

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,440
even the federal government so the

202
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,479
german government

203
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,160
we should be excited let me quote again

204
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,519
no one is safe from the virus until

205
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,640
everyone is safe

206
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,880
but it's not working at all the us the

207
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,040
eu

208
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,040
the

209
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:01,119
they all rejected the proposal outright

210
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,120
almost 100

211
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,120
has to agree or it has to decide on all

212
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,920
persons by a consensus

213
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,560
a few countries can just block the will

214
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,800
of the majority

215
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,399
there are 164 countries within that um

216
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,319
organization so 100 is actually

217
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,920
overwhelming

218
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,720
an interesting thing i want to note is

219
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,719
how the vaccine

220
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,839
was developed is

221
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,120
against this exception at the world

222
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,120
trade organization

223
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,000
that without the pharma industry there

224
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,920
will not be any development

225
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,360
of new vaccines but if you look at this

226
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,800
overview

227
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,639
you don't need to look at it in detail

228
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,839
it's enough to look at how much of

229
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:11,839
it is blue and yellow you can

230
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:15,680
see that the majority of the funds

231
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,680
for the vaccine development

232
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,330
given by the public or through

233
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,639
government funds

234
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:24,959
[Music]

235
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,720
but also alternative foundations like

236
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,719
garvey and the gates foundation

237
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:39,839
a much smaller percentage was provided

238
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,839
by the pharma industry itself

239
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,839
so the funds

240
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,199
here you can see the development of the

241
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,720
stock price

242
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,440
after the announcement of the

243
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,440
vaccination

244
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,920
so fair to uh

245
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,519
regarding the discussion at the world

246
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,599
trade organization

247
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:35,839
that the universal right to help

248
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:35,839
is um subordinated

249
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:52,639
this choice if you look at

250
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:56,079
the hiv and aids crisis of the

251
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:59,279
80s which is definitely

252
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,279
still happening today

253
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:09,199
more than half a million people um

254
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:13,440
die as a result of hiv and aids

255
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:15,359
as a result of the patent regulation

256
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,800
which the chips agreement is just an

257
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,800
example of

258
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:23,439
every price reduction of hiv and aids

259
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,439
medications

260
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,680
had to be wrangled from them by a global

261
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,760
fight for the

262
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,959
and tens of thousands had to die because

263
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,240
of the high

264
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:39,439
drug prices from eighth alone this is

265
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,440
the reason for the title

266
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,839
nevertheless this explanation

267
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,599
that there will not be scientific

268
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,600
research without the pharma industry

269
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,480
it's still stuck in the heads of many

270
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,839
even though it's just not true

271
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,839
the government

272
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,839
those are mostly public funds

273
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,090
[Music]

274
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,199
for the future vaccine in in public

275
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,199
interest

276
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,959
it should be obvious that

277
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,000
the prices at which the vaccines are

278
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,759
sold should be

279
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,600
public knowledge so

280
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:03,040
politics unfortunately i did not

281
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:06,079
learn from the experiences of the hiv

282
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,079
aids crisis

283
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,560
but they stuck to the logics which i

284
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,440
just

285
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,439
elaborated on

286
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,179
um

287
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,179
[Music]

288
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,680
for example say that incentives for

289
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:31,599
innovation are

290
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:34,800
provided by patents and

291
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,040
also the eu said

292
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,040
that

293
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,560
leads to inhibitions but

294
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:04,639
the negotiations at the wto

295
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,639
are still ongoing and

296
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,079
and accept the proposal by south africa

297
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,079
and india

298
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,960
as an intermediate conclusion we could

299
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,640
say

300
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:36,400
that the industrial nations governments

301
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:40,480
still are not ready to

302
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:43,520
work on their systems and adapt them

303
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,840
now um we're getting from the

304
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,840
wto to the who

305
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:57,280
with um support from the who

306
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:01,840
made a proposal at the very beginning of

307
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,840
the pandemic

308
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,399
knew about the danger of the patent

309
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,400
regime

310
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,919
towards a fair distribution of the

311
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,919
vaccine

312
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:19,440
so that is why

313
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:22,080
with costa rica's initiative they

314
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,280
founded a technology corporate 19

315
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,439
technology access

316
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,440
pool short c-tap

317
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,840
know-how data and software

318
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,880
and it's a very good approach to have

319
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,919
this knowledge open to everyone so that

320
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,640
everyone

321
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:07,600
can develop them further

322
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,960
this is not a revolutionary approach

323
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,039
because we've already

324
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:16,240
had it in in the hiv aids crisis with

325
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,240
very good results

326
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:25,440
it helped create processes

327
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:29,760
that made it possible for prices

328
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:33,919
for drugs for hiv and aids

329
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:37,919
to be made fairer

330
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,919
so how did this go on

331
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,799
mostly countries from the global south

332
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,600
only belgium the netherlands and

333
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,799
portugal

334
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,799
joined from the european countries

335
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,000
almost all the big pharmaceutical

336
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,420
industry

337
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,539
having countries didn't

338
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,539
[Music]

339
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,960
and also pharmaceutical companies

340
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:22,400
were quick to react pfizer for example

341
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:27,360
called the proposition that the proposal

342
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:32,080
dangerous and pointless

343
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:35,840
because instead it was suggested that

344
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:39,918
pharmaceutical companies could industry

345
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:42,639
make voluntary contributions

346
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,440
and almost all the pharmaceutical

347
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,320
companies

348
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,320
agreed to that

349
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,480
because they said it worked so well in

350
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,760
the aids

351
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,760
and hiv crisis

352
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:03,840
patterns impact how a

353
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,840
pandemic or an epidemic

354
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,199
this isn't revolutionary because it is

355
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,799
still

356
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,799
in the patent debate

357
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:31,840
still the industrial nations

358
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,840
chose a different path

359
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,640
they reacted differently to the crisis

360
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,480
it is clear then becomes it always

361
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,439
only becomes the clearer that they stick

362
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,640
to their old

363
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,679
principles and that they

364
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:57,280
actively prevent development

365
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,280
of course they have their own interests

366
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,400
they know that politically they will

367
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,600
have to find a way

368
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,200
and that is the internet why they do

369
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:19,520
exactly what has been so typical of the

370
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:22,640
industrial nations policies so far

371
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:26,480
public private partnerships

372
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:29,520
are the prime principle

373
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,520
that is applied here

374
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,559
there was an initiative called act

375
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:46,320
that was in the context of the kobach's

376
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:49,360
initiative where vaccination initiatives

377
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,918
work together with the who

378
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,360
and other organizations such as the bill

379
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,679
and melinda gates

380
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:01,120
foundation which in recent years

381
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:05,919
has become one of the most important

382
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,280
private funders of the who so i hope

383
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,880
that you

384
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,918
know um how this all works together but

385
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,320
we'll repeat it

386
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,320
again the trips agreement

387
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:23,840
that led to the crisis in life saving

388
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,840
medications

389
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,880
it led to a huge growth and process um

390
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,120
profits

391
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,120
and that money is now being used

392
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,960
to finance vaccinations

393
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:05,840
[Music]

394
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,840
uh

395
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,960
it's

396
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,840
to be eliminated

397
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,840
to provide funds

398
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,799
[Music]

399
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,799
that is clear but

400
00:24:52,880 --> 00:25:01,039
it is not stressed enough that

401
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,039
vaccinations should be a

402
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,640
are still stuck in their role of

403
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,799
waiting for help that is provided

404
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,640
voluntarily and not

405
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,639
in a legal within a legal framework

406
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:33,039
we see and that patents

407
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:36,240
medication more expensive

408
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:39,840
and that is why we chose the slogan

409
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,960
patterns are expensive but unfair

410
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,279
and this unfairness it's not just about

411
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,159
the vaccine

412
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,919
here you can see a demonstration of

413
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,799
textile workers

414
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,799
in pakistan

415
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,840
from a pakistani union

416
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:05,440
and they have huge

417
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,720
economic difficulties because

418
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,120
they're deliveries

419
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,120
we're not

420
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:25,440
this is not just a question of vaccines

421
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,200
but also other capitalistic impacts on

422
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,640
production

423
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:34,240
are the impacts of the pandemic

424
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:38,559
this is a more optimistic picture

425
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:42,000
this is those are cuban

426
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:46,639
health workers who went to south africa

427
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:52,559
to support the local health in

428
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,559
health industry so the solution would be

429
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:12,480
essentially that we eliminate

430
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,080
patterns on vaccinations and medication

431
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,679
this is a

432
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:20,720
small film from our organization

433
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,760
describing the problem which i also just

434
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,559
described in

435
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,559
the talk

436
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,640
and the solution

437
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,000
that vaccinations must be public

438
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,600
property

439
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,640
and um it calls to sign our

440
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:44,480
petitions so let's get

441
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:48,320
to the conclusion

442
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:54,720
a global health policy can only

443
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:54,720
work if we apply humanitarian principles

444
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:03,200
if we globalize patents

445
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,200
who do the patents belong

446
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,829
[Music]

447
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,080
and just as well as he wouldn't patent

448
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,039
the sun

449
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,080
he wouldn't patent his vaccine and this

450
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,440
is how

451
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,158
polio was eliminated or almost

452
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,159
eliminated

453
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,799
so we need something else than the

454
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,960
models proposed by

455
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,960
the

456
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,559
as

457
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,279
adjust the prices for medication

458
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,600
so that innovations are made available

459
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:24,720
to anyone

460
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,719
and questioning this principle

461
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,200
only

462
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,000
the whole system and that isn't going to

463
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,720
happen on its own

464
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,600
so this is why we created a global

465
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,039
initiative

466
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,039
to make

467
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,889
[Music]

468
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,799
we are taking first

469
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,059
[Music]

470
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:11,520
the prices for drugs and medications are

471
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,520
and

472
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,559
we can only hope that those who get the

473
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,000
vaccination

474
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:23,600
first will feel like um

475
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,399
we feel when we were clothing unfairly

476
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,439
produced

477
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,439
in the global south

478
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:35,440
i'm very grateful to have been able to

479
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,639
talk about this in this format in this

480
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,440
congress

481
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,440
thank you for the presentation

482
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,240
we have some questions from the internet

483
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,199
and i'll start right

484
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,559
develop

485
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:10,879
[Music]

486
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,879
so that they're affordable

487
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,559
this question about financing is

488
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:20,480
something that is posters a lot but

489
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:21,440
the assumption is that without obama

490
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,240
industry there

491
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,120
is not going to be any development or r

492
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,480
d

493
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:32,679
but in our point of view

494
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,080
this has been um calculated

495
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,480
[Music]

496
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,439
there are many organizations that stress

497
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:43,039
that it's definitely

498
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,320
they can be financed from the public

499
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,399
funds

500
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,600
with public money because we would save

501
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:51,279
so much money

502
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:54,240
in the long run and

503
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:57,919
already it's it's already true that many

504
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,919
of the funds come from public money

505
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,000
and you will get a good result if you

506
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,559
would just switch to financing where

507
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,519
it's all

508
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:10,960
public and we're we're not demanding to

509
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,519
um disappropriate the or disenfranchise

510
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,840
the

511
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,840
drug industry

512
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,279
they will definitely earn a lot of money

513
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,640
still from um the production and the

514
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:28,080
distribution of funds

515
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:31,519
but we also support a claim to um

516
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:34,720
cap drug prices thanks

517
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:37,919
if um governments are providing funds

518
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,159
shouldn't it be public good yeah

519
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,480
this is basically the gist of it or the

520
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:46,159
core of the question

521
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:49,200
at the moment we have the situation that

522
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:51,919
the risks are

523
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,200
being shouldered by the public by all of

524
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,840
us

525
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,840
where is the drug industry

526
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,559
and the profits are being privatized

527
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,639
the absurd thing about it is

528
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,799
that there are a lot of contracts

529
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,480
including

530
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,879
the german republic and the pharma

531
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,440
industry

532
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,960
and it they don't involve the final

533
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,360
price for the drug that is being

534
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,360
developed

535
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:33,679
the terms are not clear and they're not

536
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,679
being met

537
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,919
at the same time you can see a deficit

538
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,840
of democratic

539
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:47,840
um involvement here yeah another

540
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,840
um question that fits this

541
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,639
poor countries even have the possibility

542
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:58,000
to create those vaccine themselves

543
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:01,039
not automatically it's clear that

544
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,320
on the african continent where i'm

545
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:06,240
rather knowledgeable since

546
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,239
i'm responsible for that region within

547
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,000
my organization for many years

548
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,839
there is definitely a shortage of

549
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,239
production capacity

550
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,520
and definitely the production is very

551
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:19,520
complex

552
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:22,800
and you can't just tell a textile

553
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,839
manufacturing factory to

554
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,440
just switch over to drug production

555
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,199
and we would have to have started that

556
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,399
earlier but

557
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,040
it's definitely true that we also need

558
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,719
to think

559
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,599
longer term just even after covet

560
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,799
the problem doesn't go away but for

561
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,720
example in

562
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,839
many asian countries like india or

563
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,638
bangladesh

564
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:50,078
there are many factories that are

565
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,720
already producing drugs

566
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,720
for the west

567
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,520
but it's also true that this production

568
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,560
has been weakened by the

569
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,440
patent regulation regime and it would

570
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,960
already be

571
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,280
possible for many of the poorer

572
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,520
countries to produce the drugs that they

573
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,520
need

574
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,280
follow-up questions

575
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,960
how

576
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:26,080
[Music]

577
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,160
just for your example regarding the

578
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,640
corona vaccine

579
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,640
interesting

580
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,599
so look at the look at the news in

581
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,598
germany

582
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,640
it's already true that biontech is not

583
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,118
able to produce the vaccine as quickly

584
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:54,480
as would be needed right now

585
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:59,200
and it's already being considered to um

586
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,200
offshore that or to put to the

587
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,200
even in this new capitalist um or

588
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:13,839
neoliberals regime we're already

589
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,839
thinking about licensing and franchising

590
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:25,680
the recipe for the vaccine is

591
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,680
being passed on to them

592
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:31,520
this is a problem that threatens the

593
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,040
whole of humanity and that needs to be

594
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,960
solved

595
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,640
and now that it's there is a problem in

596
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,000
germany we're starting to think about

597
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,440
this even though we denied their

598
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,760
claims beforehand and

599
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,920
the core of the problem at the moment is

600
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,920
that there's a lack of political will

601
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,839
easy to get funding

602
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,799
that affects the industrialized world

603
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,960
but not for the the rest of the world

604
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:09,440
the next question how many companies

605
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,280
are part of their trips agreement and

606
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,280
how many profits did they make from that

607
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:23,440
not like it's just companies that

608
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:26,000
sponsored the trips agreement

609
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,320
with the wto are the ones that are

610
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,320
involved

611
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:37,839
the regulations extend to all companies

612
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,440
smaller companies that build a kind of

613
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:51,839
um

614
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,839
interest group

615
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,359
propel the protection of the ip

616
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,839
the pros for the companies

617
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,880
another comment from the chat somebody's

618
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,760
asking

619
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,040
if companies i think it's about

620
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,599
licensing

621
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,599
patents

622
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,319
wouldn't it also be a possibility

623
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,200
something about patents that's

624
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,480
definitely

625
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,480
a possible solution

626
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,560
actually the the same thing that the who

627
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,480
is

628
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,599
proposing they're not uh announcing

629
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,200
socialism

630
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:04,560
but they actually made a very wise um

631
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,640
proposal to get

632
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,078
the vaccine in the safest and quickest

633
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,319
way possible to all

634
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,320
people

635
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:20,560
it's also true that these these licenses

636
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:24,160
are not given out voluntarily

637
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,160
it just didn't happen at all

638
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,839
considering for example hiv and aids

639
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,839
medication

640
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,040
there's always some licensing fee that

641
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,560
has to be

642
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,599
paid to all the involved companies

643
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,200
and then it's produced somewhere

644
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,880
but else of the companies don't want

645
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,879
that

646
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,960
astrazeneca was doing it that's why

647
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,040
there's already a lot of vaccines that

648
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,400
are being produced in india

649
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,640
but the others are trying to oppose that

650
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,640
and

651
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,400
in the trips agreement but there's also

652
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,919
the possibility

653
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,400
to um declare a global emergency

654
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,920
or a global medical emergency with wh o

655
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,440
and then

656
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,040
there are certain public safety

657
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,920
regulations that your laws that you

658
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:33,440
could employ

659
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:39,839
for to have extra options

660
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,839
and if you take all that into account

661
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,000
made a very conscious decision to put

662
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:53,839
the profits of the company ahead of the

663
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,839
public safety

664
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,319
not just because of corona but generally

665
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,119
that have been afforded to the very

666
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,359
poorest of countries

667
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,480
in the past and they fought for that

668
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:28,078
over years

669
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,079
and they paid a very high price for that

670
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,359
you have to take that title literally

671
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,520
patents kill

672
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:37,200
many ten thousand probably hundreds of

673
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,040
thousands of people have died

674
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,640
because they didn't have access or

675
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,240
affordable access to necessary

medication

677
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,959
but the danger for this very poor

678
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,280
country is very real

679
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,400
for them it's just not possible to get

680
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,130
access to

681
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,520

[Music]

683
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,040
i mean what are they gonna do steal it

684
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,760
from the production line or uh

685
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,560
and then just distribute it but even

686
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:12,000
that wouldn't be possible really

687
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:15,040
if countries said

688
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,359
we need to produce drugs

689
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,560
it's just in the public interest and

690
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:22,160
critical to the

691
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,160
to the health of our populace

692
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:30,000
they were punished by

693
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,740
uh cancelling their development fund

694
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,800

we could see that for example in mexico

698
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,839
when the government

699
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,720
tried to ban certain highly refined

700
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,760
sugars imported from the usa

701
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,759
because they had a spike in type 2

702
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,240
diabetes

703
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,119
and then the us employed the trade

704
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,118
agreement nafta

705
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,680
using that treaty the american sugar

706
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:13,839
industry

707
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,839
sued the mexican government

708
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,680
a risk to the public safety with the way

709
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,118
that these

710
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,078
treaties are set up there's always the

711
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,839
question of

712
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,000
human rights on the table when you do

713
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:40,799
these trade agreements

714
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,880
and the profits always get priority

715
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,000
so we're running out of time

716
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,560
