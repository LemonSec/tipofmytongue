fantastic accessibility devices

29
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,600
um i'm going to talk about two things

30
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,600
computer but also

31
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,940
[Music]

32
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,120
or you could use physical styluses um

33
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,599
that's something that i do a lot

34
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,600
actually yeah

35
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:19,839
and if i can hold it um

36
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,279
they're like 12 grams

37
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,040
to use them so very nice on the left

38
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,279
there you can see the android speech

39
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,279

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,839
um

42
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,120
and then sometime this year i just was

43
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,120
using speeches yeah

44
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,839

[Music]

47
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,160
there's like a twitter website and

48
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,519
there's no number on it

49
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,519
it's kind of normal

50
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,160
problem in the design

51
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,839
exposes only

52
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
um

53
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,839
sometime this year they did upgrade

54
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,839
which is

55
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,839
but the server issues

56
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,079
uh um

57
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,440
i just want to really briefly show you

58
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,079
as well that this same feature of like

59
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,880
being able to

60
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,880
jesus um

[Music]

62
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,560
you know the thing to press next page or

63
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,560
something like that

64
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,839
is

65
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
is

66
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,480
you know as you can see from the chart

67
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,480
on the bottom there they're there

68
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,959
even though i would like to because i've

69
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,959
over used my hands

70
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,000
um when i'm using voicemail

71
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,680
my voice and as you can see from the

72
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,959
graph sometimes i lose it for like

73
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,920
a week or two at a time same thing with

74
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,920
any accessibility interface

75
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,480
um

76
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,680
you can read them in sunlight they last

77
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,439
forever battery wise um

78
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,959
unfortunately it's hard to add like

79
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,120
other mechanisms to them they don't have

80
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,119
mic

81
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:13,839
but for android-based devices

82
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,169
[Music]

83
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,839
my speech recognition engine called

84
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,839
silvius and it does do servers

85
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,600
one win for it i guess and it uh it is

86
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,800
published in the

87
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,600
play store did a lot of the

88
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,639
implementation

89
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:55,839
very complicated to make an

90
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:55,839
accessibility app um

91
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,758
here's the voice next page and here um

92
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,440
basically there's a connection inside

93
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,240
the voice next page the server is up and

94
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,160
running and so on i just

95
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:22,800
um see that's their server click

96
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,800
and then write

97
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,599
everything i'm saying

98
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:40,719
next page exercise next page

99
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,719
does it previous page

100
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:48,959
center center center

stop listening

103
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,519
so that's the demo of the voice next

104
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,519
page

105
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,919
two years ago and i use it a lot

106
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,120
yeah you can go ahead and download it if

107
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,000
you guys want you can just get a

108
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,879
download menu

109
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,679
the other one is called is highest next

110
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,679
page

111
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,919
i got this idea from a research paper

112
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,919
this year

113
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
um

114
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,439
um this actually doesn't need any

115
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,480
networking it's

116
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,600
backwards models from google

117
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,280
development so it's not on the play

118
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,159
store yet because it's a kind of

119
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,639
software from google

120
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,440
working and you know please contact me

121
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,600
if you want to try it

122
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:52,960
um yeah so just give me back me

123
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,959
get that demo up here and

124
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,280
so i'm going to use the the main problem

125
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,720
with this is

126
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,720
the problem with this

127
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,400
a one device version if i'm actually

128
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,360
going to use it for anything so here's

129
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,160
how this works

130
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,240
this device i point at me at my eyes the

131
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,880
other device i put where yeah

132
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,880
um exists

133
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,840
um

134
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
um

135
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:16,159
is um

136
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,159
very simple to use so i'm a big fan

137
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,320
okay so that's enough about android

138
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,840
devices let's talk very briefly about

139
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,840
the desktop computer

140
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,840
which is fine if you're just like using

141
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,840
basic things

142
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
complicated

143
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,960
up

144
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
um

145
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,960
lots

146
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,679
how you originally used dragon to work

147
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,840
on a linux machine for example

148
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,840
it runs on windows

149
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
um

150
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,959
architecture where there's client server

151
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,840
so it makes it easy to build

um

210
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,480
one thing about speech recognition very

211
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,480
into the microphone so

212
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:28,738

[Music]

214
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,000

215
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,639
about having low latency you just say

216
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:51,840
something

217
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:51,840

[Music]

220
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
um

221
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
is

222
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,840
is

223
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,840
with

224
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,678
the first thing everyone uses is the

225
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,039
nato phonetic alphabet to spell letters

226
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,880
for example

227
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,879
alpha bravo charlie um

228
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,840
sometimes the speech system doesn't

229
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,840
understand you whenever

230
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:56,439
[Music]

231
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,960
so there's a bit of lingua franca i

232
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,320
guess you can kind of guess what other

233
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,640
people are using but at the same time

234
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,840
there's

235
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,519
a lot of customization um

236
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:24,120
because because people change words they

237
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:27,160
add um

238
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,159
[Music]

239
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,039

[Music]

245
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,839

246
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:21,839
right on this community app

247
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,839

252
