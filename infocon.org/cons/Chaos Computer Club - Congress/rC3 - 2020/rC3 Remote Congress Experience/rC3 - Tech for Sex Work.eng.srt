2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,560
still the wrong language

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,520
um i'm gonna talk in english um sorry so

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,038
i'm gonna talk about

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,840
tech for sex work um it's a little bit

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,439
like

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,519
we all know the internet was made for

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,400
porn

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,198
i guess but if the internet was made for

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,399
porn

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,440
why is it so hostile towards sex workers

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,800
and usually in the beginning of a talk

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,718
there's like an introduction

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,718
um often like an introduction from like

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,200
someone else or at least like the person

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,440
who's

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,640
giving like a little bit of explanation

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,800
who they are

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,559
and that is a little bit complicated in

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,199
that case because i need like a little

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,800
bit of

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,718
um explanation to the introduction so

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,078
if you happen to know me for whatever

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,480
reason

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,680
please look very carefully into this

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,440
split stingzy

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,610
because forget whatever you know about

[Music]

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,280
we first gonna talk about the sex work

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,720
persona

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,280
what is a sex work persona

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,200
well i found a lot of good gifts that's

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,600
pretty small it should be a bit bigger

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,520
but i hope you do understand or see

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,759
sailor moon transforming into sailor

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,798
moon i have no clue what sailor moon's

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,759
i don't know legal name is but yeah

39
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,159
and we're going to talk a little bit

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,479
about persona before um

41
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,280
what is a persona persona is kind of

42
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,840
like a

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,799
person you become for like some some

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,560
time or like

45
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,680
for some some thought um

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,119
and it is mainly some kind of privacy

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,280
thing just like oh yeah sometimes you're

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,439
like a different person um so it's like

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,600
kind of like your privacy protection

50
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,520
um but it's also like a way to create

51
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,079
your own boundaries what to do like in

52
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,280
what persona

53
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:02,479
and persona is a very

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,560
um but kind of comes out of acting as

55
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,399
actors usually take on personas and like

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,239
roles for some

57
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,160
time and i'm pretty happy to give this

58
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,000
talk at the c base because i learned a

59
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,920
lot of acting in the sea base

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,760
so the persona is also some kind of

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,519
method acting

62
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,519
or connected to method acting because it

63
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,160
is kind of like find the persona in

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,879
yourself that you're gonna portray and

65
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,720
that is why sex workers usually work on

66
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,319
a different name so they kind of

67
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,239
mask themselves um that leads to

68
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,238
like easily to the question about like

69
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,560
well if like

70
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,680
a sex worker is like someone else like

71
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,959
isn't it like some kind of

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,959
authenticity issue and shouldn't you

73
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,120
always be like your authentic self and

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,239
like always the same person and like

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:53,760
very connected to who you are to your

76
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,760
inner self that idea is

77
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:01,200
in some in some connections useful

78
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,840
but in the context of yeah of sex work

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,679
but also in general i'd say authenticity

80
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,280
works as like some idea but

81
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:13,040
all together it is kind of [ __ ]

82
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,319
why is that we all do have clashing

83
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,040
personas

84
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,119
we all are different people at different

85
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,920
times

86
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,120
in the context of sex work um and a lot

87
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,958
of people i guess will

88
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,040
look because or watch the talk because

89
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,440
well sex and sex sells

90
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,040
um you're like a very different person

91
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,720
if you are having sex with someone

92
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,040
or if you're having like lunch with your

93
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,200
grandma and if you don't agree with it

94
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,079
then i'd say something is strange with

95
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,679
you

96
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,480
or maybe you are i don't know the

97
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,680
grandpa to your grandma

98
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,959
but otherwise you're just like a

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,560
different persona and so the

100
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,319
authenticity

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,519
thing does get like a hit there because

102
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,319
we are different people like in

103
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,519
different

104
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,280
um yeah different connections so we do

105
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,120
have like clashing personas

106
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,560
what does it mean to have like clashing

107
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,000
personas

108
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,000
for sex workers usually it means like

109
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,680
well you have at least like two names

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,280
and if you have like two names you

111
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,560
usually also do have two

112
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,560
phones which is like the next slide um

113
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,319
and it creates like a lot of question

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,239
about like well when are you like what

115
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,079
persona how do you deal with that

116
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,680
in the context of the internet how do

117
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,079
you deal with like online dating that

118
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,280
isn't

119
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,320
work um like what persona do you use for

120
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,919
that and

121
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,159
how do you deal with stuff like image

122
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,520
reverse search so if you have like your

123
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,360
own images somewhere

124
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,960
how do you deal with them like how are

125
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,560
you not found in the other

126
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,359
persona and that's kind of like just

127
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,880
clashing clashing apart

128
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,800
um what if is what is if your

129
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,080
day job or like if you have a second job

130
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,320
or like a different

131
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,198
background that is kind of public too

132
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,840
which is yeah just clashing personas

133
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,840
um and to demonstrate that or what i

134
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,679
mean with caching personas i have like a

135
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,960
short clip that i

136
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,000
try to wait to go through

137
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,359
um yeah just a 20 second clip

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,479
watch it i love you miles

139
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,960
yeah i know dad you gotta say i love you

140
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,840
back

141
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,840
dad are you serious

142
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,880
dad i love you that's a copy

143
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,400
so in this clip there are like a lot of

144
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,320
things that are

145
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,239
worth mentioning like the abuse of

146
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,680
police force by his dad because he's

147
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,199
just using like the police car

148
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,800
um to embarrass his son in front of the

149
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,000
whole school um

150
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,520
but that's not really the point what i

151
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,360
want to talk about like the embarrassing

152
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,560
part because on the one hand

153
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,919
miles the kid wants to be like a good

154
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,520
kid to his dad

155
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,039
so he does want to say like oh yeah i

156
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,479
love you but he's also like really

157
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,280
embarrassed because he's in front of the

158
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,039
school

159
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,359
and in school he's just a different

160
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,240
persona so that is what i mean if i'm

161
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,360
talking about clashing personas you are

162
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,800
just different people

163
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,479
like we are different people like

164
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,039
different settings and sometimes these

165
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,400
settings

166
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:07,280
clash in my talk here today

167
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:11,679
two of my personas clash so

168
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:14,400
who am i well on the one hand

169
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,960
i have no clue i do not know who i am it

170
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,960
depends a lot on the context

171
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,799
but still try to give like some kind of

172
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,520
context well on the one hand

173
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,039
i'm a former politician and activist um

174
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,560
i was like a board member for the pirate

175
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,759
party back when the pirate party was

176
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,560
still a thing

177
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,039
i did a lot of like of privacy activism

178
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,600
um

179
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,199
years ago and to some degree i'm still

180
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,440
activist because i'm giving this talk

181
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,360
and talk now about sex workers rights

182
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,880
um and on the other hand well i'm a sex

183
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,440
worker but how do

184
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,639
like sex work and politics go together

185
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,319
because that's like well

186
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,080
no that doesn't really work um so

187
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,639
while i'm like kind of like outing

188
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,479
myself here in like these two personas

189
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,639
i do want to make sure you that you do

190
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,199
understand this that these are different

191
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,319
personas and we aren't always the same

192
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,160
the same person um

193
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,840
so on the one hand well i'm garunagar

194
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,080
that's like my legal name

195
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,359
that is my politician or former

196
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,719
politician also like

197
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,360
mainly my activist um name um also it's

198
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,919
rifle

199
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,800
and well then i'm dennis deep um the sex

200
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,280
worker

201
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,639
who does sex work and

202
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,400
in this context that i'm like giving

203
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,319
this talk it's like well i know the sea

204
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,679
was basically a scare and like a lot of

205
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,199
net activism and stuff but i'm also

206
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,919
talking about sex work and that's like

207
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,919
well

208
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,000
the other identity so what identity is

209
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:40,318
like real here and what it's like

210
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,000
properly and it isn't really easy to say

211
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,639
and on that saying why am i outing

212
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,560
myself here like why do i do that

213
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,400
on the one hand um i'm quite aware of

214
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,039
like my privileges in this context

215
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,280
they're like well

216
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,039
i'm a man so i do have a lot of

217
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,000
privilege over like woman and most sex

218
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,440
workers are women um

219
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,039
but also i don't really have much of a

220
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,440
family i don't really have children

221
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,639
i don't have anyone else to pull down

222
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,879
there like i don't have

223
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,759
like i don't um like to a lot of sex

224
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,759
workers it's very hard to out themselves

225
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,440
as it will create a lot of stigma not

226
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,440
only to them but also to their family

227
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,520
and yeah i'm like on a rather lucky side

228
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,560
that i don't really have one

229
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,359
um and on a

230
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,160
short side note there will be people at

231
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,440
least i've had

232
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,879
like plenty of them to tell me that well

233
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,280
like if you have like two personas

234
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,440
that's like kind of i don't know

235
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,120
bad for you and like some kind of hobby

236
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,599
psychologist telling you like yeah

237
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,240
don't do that that's evil or something

238
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,479
um

239
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,519
and sorry but i do know what's good for

240
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,959
me and not you

241
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,480
so don't um so let's start into the

242
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,880
actual talk

243
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,399
we start with what is sex and

244
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,519
i'm like a little bit disappointed that

245
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,480
we don't really have like a proper

246
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,680
audience and

247
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,080
well we can't have that um but i'd love

248
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,599
to

249
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,680
have the audience stand up just like

250
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,120
okay what is sex and

251
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,519
answer like well is kissing sex if so

252
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,320
sit down and kind of like push pressure

253
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,680
on people

254
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,000
because we don't really want to talk

255
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,439
about it and part of why sex work is so

256
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,200
stigmatized is because we don't talk

257
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,800
about sex work but we generally don't

258
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,640
talk about sex

259
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:25,120
um and is kissing sex

260
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:29,279
to you um is sexting sex like

261
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:32,399
sending nudes and stuff is that sex

262
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,920
is masturbation sex and they have heard

263
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,320
through all of them like different

264
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,760
parts and then well penetration that's

265
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,040
kind of like the obvious things like oh

266
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,160
yeah everyone agrees that at least

267
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,000
penetration is sex but

268
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,519
even there well i know people who say

269
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,240
that [ __ ] aren't sex

270
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,920
because i don't know they don't count

271
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,160
and the answer to that is well sex is

272
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,560
whatever makes you feel

273
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,760
sex like whatever gives you the feeling

274
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,319
of having sex of

275
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,399
being sexually engaged with someone

276
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,760
consensually if it isn't consensually it

277
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,959
is not sex

278
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,040
um so there's two points basically um

279
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,399
everyone involved has consented into it

280
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,959
and the other one is just the feeling

281
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,880
that you

282
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,439
have sex um then we come to what is sex

283
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,760
work

284
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,279
and sex work is basically whatever you

285
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,439
do for the

286
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,399
sex feeling for that sexual pleasure

287
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,160
that you can give

288
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:27,440
for money um but it is also

289
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,640
to a huge degree care work um and care

290
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,240
work well that's basically

291
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:35,600
what a lot of teachers do um

292
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,079
what yeah all kind of child care is

293
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,240
to take care of people that's usually an

294
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,439
unpaid work

295
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,880
and usually something that women do and

296
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,360
when that gets paid as a sex work

297
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,000
that often creates a lot of issues which

298
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,200
is

299
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,200
yeah pretty awful

300
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,440
and also sex work is to a huge degree

301
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,640
fiction

302
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,839
recreate to a lot of um degree um

303
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,240
environment for people um to live their

304
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,079
sexual pleasures whatever that might be

305
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,000
and the fiction part will create like

306
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,519
issues against like yeah if sex work is

307
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
fiction isn't that like kind of evil and

308
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,279
aren't we like

309
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,200
playing our clients and stuff um and no

310
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,120
everyone knows that what fiction is and

311
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,320
like how sex work is fiction no one

312
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,120
believes that our

313
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,839
often quite fake name uh fake sounding

314
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,040
names

315
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,040
are real and every child knows that

316
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,800
bob the builder is fiction so i'm pretty

317
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,880
sure our clients can

318
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,479
can see the line that's like well we do

319
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,519
create like a fictional world for them

320
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,240
for some time and

321
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,880
after that that's done as well so let's

322
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,120
go to

323
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,240
prostitution what is prostitution isn't

324
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,560
it kind of like the same

325
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:51,040
as sex work and yeah it kind of is um

326
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,119
but it is often called that it's like

327
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,760
the oldest profession in the world

328
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,040
it is something that we a sex worker

329
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,079
often say kind of to

330
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,279
justify ourselves um

331
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:06,239
but actually that's not true

332
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,560
prostitution and the way we use the word

333
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,160
was created like 100 years ago like 120

334
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,199
years ago

335
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,439
it is basically police regulation of sex

336
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,560
in that case and sex of a woman because

337
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,880
well gay sex

338
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,079
or lesbian sex was no sex at all back at

339
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,160
that time

340
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,479
and gay sex was forbidden anyway so

341
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,920
prostitution is basically to or like the

342
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,079
prostitution as we use

343
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:33,120
the word today was mainly created

344
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,209
around 1900 when stronger

345
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,440
laws came into place and

346
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,760
[Music]

347
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,880
yeah and a lot of people are like um a

348
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,600
lot of women were

349
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,120
checked by the police um if they are

350
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,399
like sex workers

351
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,959
and they had to undergo a lot of very

352
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,519
humiliating processes by being checked

353
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,399
by police doctors and stuff

354
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,680
and that is the early yeah the early

355
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,560
development of like

356
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,599
the uh prohibition movement that we have

357
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,279
these days

358
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,680
so back in around 1900 like the first

359
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,439
wave or like the first feminist groups

360
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,120
were fighting against sex workers and

361
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,480
prostitution because they felt

362
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,519
attacked that they might also undergo

363
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,600
the police mistreatment that

364
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,959
a lot of women had to deal with also

365
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,720
prostitutes or

366
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:26,959
sex workers and that is why

367
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,240
yeah why so many feminists are like why

368
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,319
there's like a tradition of like

369
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,880
feminism kind of fighting against sex

370
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,399
work

371
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,399
some feminism not all

372
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,639
and yeah so

373
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,560
which is kind of interesting that this

374
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,160
kind of anti-behavior

375
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,800
um focus on the prostitution or like on

376
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,279
the woman

377
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,040
doing it and like not on the evil police

378
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,079
regulation and like on the evil police

379
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,839
laws

380
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:58,880
um but what did it look like

381
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,680
um yeah once upon a time like

382
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,480
what was or what is traditionally seen

383
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,760
as sex work

384
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,120
and well they're like brothers that's

385
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
kind of like what everyone kind of

386
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,360
believes

387
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,199
and well there's like street sex work we

388
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,440
all have seen like well most people

389
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,040
have seen at least some movies some some

390
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,040
sex workers at the street

391
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,120
um and they're like agencies and that's

392
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,599
kind of like the traditional way

393
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,320
um so that you do have like some people

394
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,880
setting

395
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,920
yeah setting dates up that is a little

396
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,199
bit

397
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,839
glitchy towards towards

398
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,439
pimping which is like well that's like

399
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,600
always evil but

400
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,959
it is it's a little bit like more

401
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,839
complicated as well

402
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,518
a lot of sex workers do need agencies um

403
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,560
to set up clients and like to find

404
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,040
clients and we

405
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:47,040
as yeah workers we do need clients

406
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,839
and what does sex work today well we

407
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,199
still have like brothers and street work

408
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,360
nothing changed there well we do have

409
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,439
like a lot of strip clubs not that much

410
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,800
currently but generally we do have like

411
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,959
a lot of escort websites

412
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,680
so so um a lot of sex work

413
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,719
at least connecting is happening online

414
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,959
these days

415
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,880
we do have like phone sex um we do have

416
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,199
sex thing that can be

417
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,399
yeah can be paid we have a lot of

418
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,359
camming so

419
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,720
um and well we do have porn um the

420
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,320
difference between coming and pawn is

421
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,839
basically that caming is like an

422
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,680
usually one-on-one interaction and

423
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,560
that's like happening live and porn is

424
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,399
more like the

425
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:29,199
properly performed sexual act that is

426
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,920
made or like that is like produced way

427
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,839
way more

428
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:37,680
um yeah way more

429
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,680
professionally um

430
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,480
what is a little bit um interesting or

431
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,320
like

432
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,600
in on that level is like why isn't like

433
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,480
erotic literature

434
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,279
seen as sex work and generally that's

435
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,399
kind of like well

436
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,000
if like phone sex or sex work why isn't

437
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,000
like i don't know writing

438
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,839
novels or stuff um sex work and the

439
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,600
point is or like the reason is mainly

440
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,440
like across historically one

441
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,800
because like well you had like a lot of

442
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,040
sex workers and with

443
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,279
technology evolving they weren't there

444
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,959
and um literature was always around and

445
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,320
pondered which i was like always around

446
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,319
so that's a little bit like

447
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,160
it is a little bit blurry but that's

448
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,040
where we do see

449
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,160
see um a change and why did it change

450
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,800
like why did

451
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,120
sex work become a tech thing why do i

452
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,680
talk about tech in context of like sex

453
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,680
work

454
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,199
um sex isn't really something that

455
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,680
happened with like of tech but

456
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,599
rather i don't know human to human

457
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,160
there's like not that much technology

458
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,320
um involved but on the one hand well

459
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,040
everything kind of moves online so

460
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,560
yeah sure sex work does too but on the

461
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,959
other hand we also have like new

462
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,599
legal challenges that kind of push sex

463
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,518
work

464
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,880
um into different spaces um

465
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,120
so for the first we're gonna talk about

466
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,160
decriminalization that is kind of what

467
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,920
most sex workers want um that we do not

468
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,480
have like any criminal law

469
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,680
um about us like well we're just like

470
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,720
professionals

471
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,520
um offering a service so why can't we

472
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,280
just have that

473
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,199
and in most countries that's not the

474
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,199
case it is the case in

475
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,319
a couple of states in australia and in

476
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,839
new zealand

477
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,839
and nearly in japan on that level we do

478
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,760
see that decriminalization alone

479
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:25,119
isn't helping as in japan only

480
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,839
vaginal sex is seen as

481
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,239
prostitution and every sexual practice

482
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,320
that

483
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:35,360
isn't yeah happening vaginal

484
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,360
it isn't yeah it isn't seen as sex work

485
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,039
and therefore they're like no criminal

486
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,760
rules applied

487
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,039
and yet japan is incredible stigmatized

488
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,039
country

489
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:49,039
on sex work and

490
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,480
why we do want decriminalization and we

491
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,200
don't want any more criminalizations

492
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,360
because

493
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,400
we want more rights we want rights for

494
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,719
ourselves we want to

495
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,679
kind of unionize and fight for our

496
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,520
rights and

497
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:04,559
no more wrong laws can help us

498
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,960
it's like our point then let's talk

499
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,960
about

500
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,799
legalization and that's often kind of

501
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,840
seen as the same but it isn't

502
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:16,000
um so when i don't know a lot of

503
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:18,240
drug people drug people sounds awful um

504
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,039
but like when we like when people are

505
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,200
arguing for

506
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,879
legalizing drugs that's like often

507
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,799
legalization just like well

508
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,919
they want like a specific rule where we

509
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,960
can or where

510
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,720
people can can consume drugs legally but

511
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,960
like in a safe environment

512
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,000
on sex work we do not want to have this

513
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,360
kind of regulated

514
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,360
environment as legalization as we do

515
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,159
have it in a couple of countries

516
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,120
for example germany we do have usually

517
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,280
registration

518
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,879
so what we have is we have this kind of

519
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,678
i'm not sure if we can actually see that

520
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,520
maybe we

521
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,120
should have talked about that um so we

522
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,960
do get like some kind of paper

523
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:59,760
that we have to register at an

524
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,440
governmental office and so that's like a

525
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,240
database where all our

526
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,440
data is in to check whether we are like

527
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,080
legal to work

528
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,720
and if you don't have that that paper

529
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,960
and if you do

530
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,559
work as a sex worker and get checked you

531
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,120
do have to pay a fine

532
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,600
um which is if you're like an escort or

533
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,760
something

534
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,600
like not that bad like well you can

535
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,080
still do that if you do work in some

536
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,480
kind of studio like some kind of brothel

537
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,760
the brothel will be shut down if anyone

538
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,360
will ever find out

539
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,679
that someone worked in it without

540
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,639
registration so for a lot of people who

541
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,039
do work on a

542
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,320
in brothels or studios that is like a

543
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,039
very important thing to

544
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,320
to have this registration which we don't

545
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,559
want to have because

546
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,799
who knows how long that database is safe

547
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,639
and we all know that databases

548
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,400
aren't that safe at least not the

549
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,320
governmental ones

550
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,080
but legalization also means that we have

551
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,520
a lot of other restrictions

552
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,199
for example like in germany we talk

553
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,960
about spielberg zuck

554
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,039
which is kind of like a restricted area

555
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,679
in which sex work can't happen

556
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,360
and what people often understand like oh

557
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,039
yeah like street sex work can't happen

558
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,320
and it's like yeah maybe like the area

559
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,520
around schools or something

560
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,280
they shouldn't have any any sex work um

561
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,639
but it doesn't mean like every kind of

562
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,158
sex work it doesn't mean that there

563
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,520
can't be like any brothel um inner

564
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:20,880
abuser which is in germany um statewide

565
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,879
organized so um berlin doesn't have it

566
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,120
but a lot of states do have it

567
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,559
um with like very confusing rules it's

568
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,678
like hard to follow to understand

569
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,120
okay where can i work and can i not work

570
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,720
and it does include like all kind of

571
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,320
hotels or something so

572
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,760
if i have like a client who's like

573
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,200
requesting me to like a hotel and i'm

574
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,000
going there i kind of have to check

575
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,799
beforehand

576
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,360
if that hotel is in a second like why

577
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,679
the [ __ ]

578
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,120
would that ever matter to anyone but

579
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,400
this is also part of like

580
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,799
legalization process

581
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,840
and it does include regulation of sex

582
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,240
practices

583
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,360
um it does include to say like what kind

584
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,520
of sex practices are

585
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,399
allowed and what do we have to use as in

586
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,400
germany we

587
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,720
we are legally bound to always use

588
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,919
condoms for all kind of sex and

589
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:09,600
um well as my clients are mostly

590
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,480
men so be like well so in all the

591
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,280
unpaid sex it's like totally fine to um

592
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,440
to have sex without condom or something

593
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,480
on the power on the on the point that i

594
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,240
get paid

595
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,840
um i can't do that i can't even give

596
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,080
like a [ __ ] without a condom which is

597
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:28,959
kind of like

598
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:30,960
weird um and that is the legalization

599
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,320
approach that we do have in in germany

600
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,559
as well um

601
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,799
then we do have like the criminalization

602
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,720
approach that is like a rather easy one

603
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,520
everything is criminal and everything is

604
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,120
evil

605
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,440
sex workers forbidden it is basically

606
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,479
yeah police pimps organized crimes

607
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,400
um as bad as it can get um and to

608
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,919
justify that's like how it looks because

609
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,400
yeah you just get jailed

610
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,919
um there's like nothing really to do and

611
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,120
then we have the swedish model

612
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:02,799
the swedish model is a mean one

613
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,600
it claims to be there for sex workers it

614
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,280
claims to

615
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,399
help sex workers out of the scene um

616
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:13,678
it is the so-called sex by law

617
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,559
so sex work itself is legal but it is

618
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,720
illegal to buy sex

619
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,000
which means the sex worker itself

620
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,159
doesn't do anything wrong but

621
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,240
every client is doing wrong when they

622
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,799
request

623
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,240
sex um so it's like a cro client

624
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,480
communisation

625
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,320
and whoever takes money from a sex

626
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,440
worker becomes a pimp

627
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,080
that includes landlords so if my

628
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,280
landlord

629
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,000
knows if i'd be in sweden

630
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,879
and my landlord knows that i'm a sex

631
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,320
worker

632
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:49,440
and i'm gonna use the money that i earn

633
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,039
with sex for paying my rent my landlord

634
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,120
becomes a pimp

635
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,879
and on the one hand it's kind of funny

636
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,678
because well who does really like

637
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,600
landlords

638
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,600
but on the other hand it's like well

639
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,280
that also means that sex workers can't

640
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,480
out themselves ever anywhere because

641
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,280
otherwise they won't get any

642
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,320
any flat ever because well no one wants

643
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,960
to become a pimp

644
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,200
and want to be prosecuted as a pimp so

645
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,640
that creates like a huge stigma on that

646
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,720
level

647
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,919
and the swedish model all together well

648
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,080
it says that um

649
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,960
it wants to protect sex workers from

650
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,360
clients and

651
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,360
i don't know evil environment and stuff

652
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,799
it actually increases violence because

653
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,320
you don't have any safe

654
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,760
work environment you don't have any kind

655
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,600
of brothers or something because no one

656
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,600
can earn money with it

657
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,360
or no one can legally earn money with it

658
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,360
and therefore a lot of it

659
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:42,479
pushes further into a criminal

660
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:44,320
environment as in northern ireland where

661
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,840
the swedish model was introduced like a

662
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,639
couple of years ago the queen's

663
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,720
university

664
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,440
which is based in belfast and northern

665
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,679
ireland had like a huge study on it

666
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,559
before the swedish model was introduced

667
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,400
there

668
00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:01,678
on how big the the general

669
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,440
sex business scene was and

670
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,720
two years later after it was introduced

671
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,400
it had like the same

672
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:11,279
um research again and it found out that

673
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,279
it didn't change like the it was still

674
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,240
around the same number of people working

675
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,720
in the sex work

676
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,600
but the violence increased by like 26

677
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,120
percent

678
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:24,240
so the swedish model does not abolish

679
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,559
um sex work which it claims to do

680
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,559
but it just increases a lot of sex a lot

681
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,678
of violence so

682
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,918
um yeah to

683
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,799
show that that's a bit like how i

684
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,840
imagine the

685
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,279
swedish model is that well

686
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,039
she is like really good she has like

687
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,679
everything she can but everyone like

688
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,440
well she is

689
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:48,480
pretty uh practically in a prison um but

690
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,520
yeah everything around her is uh

691
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,640
oh she can't connect anyone because

692
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:57,918
you can't um

693
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,960
the internet is made for porn but where

694
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:04,159
is it really like where do we find pawn

695
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,720
if we want to look it up um and well we

696
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,880
all know

697
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,640
once there was a lot of porn on tumblr

698
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,960
but that's gone

699
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,880
are they like any pawn apps no they

700
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,200
aren't why aren't there any pawn apps

701
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,000
why does it not exist what is about

702
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,600
social media

703
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,120
there isn't really much porn on social

704
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,559
media why is that

705
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,559
and the internet kind of moved there so

706
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,600
where is the pawn if the internet was

707
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,600
once made for it

708
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,679
and well it kind of disappeared mainly

709
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,640
because of the terms of services of

710
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,640
all kinds of services

711
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,120
and yeah in terms of services it's just

712
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,720
a lot of reading

713
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,000
we do do that because we have to figure

714
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,919
out like where to work and

715
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,679
well we do have like stuff like female

716
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,159
nipple band on

717
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,720
instagram like oh why are like male

718
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,600
nipples

719
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,360
allowed but female nipples nothing close

720
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,678
up what's the difference between them

721
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,479
where the fact is that coming from we do

722
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,840
have like a lot of

723
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,080
real name policy and as i kind of

724
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,080
explained earlier what is a real name

725
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,158
isn't like a lot depending on like who

726
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,240
we are in what context

727
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,360
why is dennis not my real name it is my

728
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,360
real name it is like

729
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,360
how i'm interacting with a lot of people

730
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,840
why is it like not real because like not

731
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,639
legal what the [ __ ] since when does the

732
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,600
internet

733
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,480
require like author authorization like

734
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,639
that that's

735
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,840
awful and well a lot of services just

736
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,039
have like a new

737
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,439
new nudity um uh

738
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,879
restriction and then kind of like the

739
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,360
next ideas like oh yeah if you want to

740
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,880
have

741
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,799
um pawn just have it like on your own

742
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,120
website and then we do have

743
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,559
the issue of youth protection and a lot

744
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,479
of like

745
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,000
people understand that we do want to

746
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,640
want to protect youth

747
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,279
um from whatever might be harmful and if

748
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,200
porn is

749
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,880
considered harmful to youth then we do

750
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,080
want to protect them from it

751
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,960
however to have it on like your own

752
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,520
website

753
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,080
the legal requirements in germany say

754
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,200
that

755
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,320
you have to have the idea of everyone

756
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,320
who's watching

757
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:09,039
whatever might be considered harmful to

758
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,200
young people that means that if you want

759
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,960
to have porn on your own website

760
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,200
um you have to have some kind of

761
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,159
checking mechanism for everyone who's

762
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,520
watching that

763
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,000
so you can't just have it on your

764
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,320
website you do need like a lot of

765
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,200
technology to figure out no one is

766
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,240
accessing it

767
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,200
without without you knowing who it is

768
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,320
um and on porn which most people don't

769
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,080
really want to talk about

770
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:36,399
that's that's quite an issue um

771
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,158
we do have in germany um some stuff like

772
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,959
imprint so we do need to have like

773
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,240
our address on the on our own website

774
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,440
there are like ways around them they're

775
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,080
like services

776
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,960
um that provide you with an imprint that

777
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,918
does not have

778
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,640
your legal um your legal address on it

779
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,679
but of

780
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,720
some kind of service um which a lot of

781
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,919
sex workers use

782
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,840
because well we usually don't work at

783
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,120
our own home and we usually don't want

784
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,840
our clients to come

785
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,439
to our home because that's yeah we are

786
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,080
someone different like at home and at

787
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,000
work

788
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,678
um that is why we do have all that work

789
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,600
persona and stuff

790
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,520
um and well there's like dominate domain

791
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,840
registration and stuff so

792
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,360
um at least like in the registry um

793
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,399
usually there's like your

794
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,559
your address and stuff as well um

795
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,678
the dynamic the german domain

796
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,840
registration

797
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,799
um doesn't publish it anymore but or

798
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,039
like

799
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,760
you do need to prove that you have

800
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,000
reasonable reason to access it but

801
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,520
yeah it is still an issue and then

802
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,240
talking about the internet as a lot of

803
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,639
people will

804
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,960
come i'm pretty sure of it as we talked

805
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,840
about um social media what is with the

806
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,039
fatty words

807
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:48,080
can't we all just use mastodon and stuff

808
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:50,600
and yes we kind of could

809
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,720
um and there's like an instant as

810
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,399
twitter.at

811
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,559
which is yeah just like a sex work

812
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:01,520
twitter or masteredon instant

813
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,480
but the issue with the federers is well

814
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,279
we usually

815
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,679
use social media to attract clients and

816
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,720
find

817
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:11,520
clients and seriously

818
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,360
how many of you actually use the master

819
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,799
donor like the federal verse like on a

820
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:20,559
on a real basis not just for like some

821
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,039
tech pawn and my experience well the

822
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,100
federal

823
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,279
is rather empty sadly

824
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,918
[Music]

825
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,679
and let's talk about algorithms that's a

826
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:34,240
thing that a lot of people talk about

827
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:37,039
lately why do we talk about it

828
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,039
or what is important for for sex work in

829
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,720
the context of algorithm

830
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,279
one of them is spam filters because sex

831
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,760
work

832
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,000
and sex altogether is like so little

833
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,360
talked about it is like a really good

834
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,559
way to scan people and

835
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,559
we all have seen a lot of scam emails

836
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,559
concerning somewhat sex and what

837
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,158
happened over the years

838
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,918
or over some time and some machine

839
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,720
learning is that

840
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:07,440
every email that contains words like sex

841
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,360
or [ __ ] or whatever

842
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,480
it's not going to get through your spam

843
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,199
filter

844
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,159
and that's the reason why the booster

845
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,120
ban saxabyte

846
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,159
like kind of the german uh service

847
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,399
workers union

848
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,440
does have like a different domain for

849
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,120
our emails as

850
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:28,000
well both sexabyte de contains

851
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,639
the letters s e and x after each other

852
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,559
and

853
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,240
a lot of spam filters will just like

854
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,960
fill that out completely so we do need

855
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,240
like a different

856
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,919
domain for our emails because

857
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,880
these are things you can't talk about

858
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:44,960
that's just not getting through

859
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,520
and we do have stuff like shadow banning

860
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,880
so shadow banning is like not limited to

861
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,799
sex workers

862
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,000
a lot of people do get shadow band on

863
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,240
the internet or like on

864
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,240
all kind of platforms for using like too

865
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,720
many hashtags or something

866
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,640
but it is quite interestingly how many

867
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,080
sex workers are shadow band

868
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:07,519
and shadow banning is

869
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,960
like you can't um like your profile

870
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,720
doesn't disappear you don't really

871
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,559
notice that you're a shadow band at

872
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,640
some point um or it's like rather

873
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,879
accidentally that you may notice

874
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,080
um because you just can't be searched

875
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,159
anymore like if you

876
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,199
if you look for shadow band accounts and

877
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,039
if you search it

878
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,200
on it like instagram or twitter or

879
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,440
something um it does not show up

880
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,799
um so you can still tweet and stuff but

881
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,640
it in like all kind of

882
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:34,158
of um yeah of uh text or something it

883
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,880
just doesn't come up

884
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,480
um and on algorithm i also do have the

885
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,080
rather recent question

886
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:46,000
um like my talk in the uh

887
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:49,439
yeah in the uh recommendation

888
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,240
is like together with inside exams

889
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,120
that i know like drug dealing uh and

890
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,159
nazis in

891
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,918
games and why is that

892
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,799
i mean i'm basically talking about like

893
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:04,080
workers rights who the fact decided

894
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:06,879
that the only place to put my talk is

895
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,519
nazis drugs and exams which is a pretty

896
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,559
awful

897
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,240
porn site

898
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,918
and i do not believe that anyone did it

899
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,320
like intentionally i do believe that's

900
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,159
like

901
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,240
some kind of algorithm bias i'm not sure

902
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,399
of that if anyone does have

903
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,679
well know where the recommendations came

904
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,678
from please let me know

905
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,320
let's talk about payment sex work is

906
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,519
basically getting paid for sex

907
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,000
so how do we get paid and usually it's

908
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,600
like well

909
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,840
cash cash is pretty awesome that's kind

910
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,439
of like anonymous and we can use it

911
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:43,840
um easily so let's use use cash but

912
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:46,080
online how do you use cash online

913
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,360
and the easy way and the most common way

914
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,720
is paypal

915
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,479
so like oh yeah that's kind of like the

916
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,240
easiest way to pay some weight and yeah

917
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,799
no that's like not anonymous but

918
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,240
you can still use it and paypal has a

919
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:59,039
very strict no

920
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,799
sex work um terms of service so it does

921
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,840
close all kind of accounts

922
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,480
to sex workers very regularly and it

923
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,639
freezes all

924
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,159
assets for like month and month that you

925
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,360
have to fight for to get back to your

926
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,200
own money that you have

927
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,519
because paypal just says like yeah no we

928
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,399
don't do that that's out of our

929
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,440
terms of service and we don't care um so

930
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,439
that's kind of like

931
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,200
yeah that would be pretty awesome but it

932
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,640
doesn't really work at least

933
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,880
yeah you need like new accounts

934
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,000
regularly and it's just paying on the s

935
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,200
and why is that why

936
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,200
why can't we just use it um

937
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,559
it's like oh yeah we do have like ibunz

938
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,440
and zipper

939
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,918
and um so can't we just like transfer

940
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,080
money

941
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,840
the i don't know at least in german kind

942
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,399
of traditional way

943
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,199
and yes we can um since we do have the

944
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,199
ibm numbers

945
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,479
you can use a different name

946
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,080
for the bank account holder and it will

947
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,519
still arrive but it's still a thing to

948
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,279
give out your iron

949
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,480
um and it only works within germany like

950
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,360
if you do have like a bank account

951
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,760
outside of germany

952
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,199
and transferring money your name will be

953
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,960
um

954
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,519
visible to whoever paid you um which is

955
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,839
yeah quite an issue um what's with

956
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,960
credit cards can't we use credit cards

957
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,239
um and the idea is kind of like yeah why

958
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,000
not and the point is

959
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,399
very similar to people they just don't

960
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,960
want us um we are kind of like i don't

961
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,319
know

962
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,399
the ugly people on the internet or

963
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,200
something they don't want us

964
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,440
um and what will come up very obviously

965
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,118
is

966
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,879
cryptocurrencies why can't we use

967
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,679
cryptocurrencies well we can

968
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,399
um the question is more like well on the

969
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,320
one hand show

970
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,078
we as sex workers need to figure out how

971
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,919
to use them but also

972
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,839
how do our clients use them and most of

973
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,879
our clients are like rather odd and

974
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,440
not that tax heavy so cryptocurrencies

975
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:47,440
aren't really an issue maybe one day

976
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,200
they will be

977
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,359
but so far they aren't really helpful

978
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,839
for us and i'm not aware of any sex

979
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,359
worker

980
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,159
regularly getting paid in

981
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,839
cryptocurrencies um

982
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,280
and to some degree it's also a great

983
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,680
question about if we really

984
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,640
want to trust into cryptocurrencies but

985
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,839
there's a talk for

986
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,879
another time and what happens

987
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,839
as payment online usually is we get gift

988
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,520
cards

989
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:15,040
that's our payment and that's

990
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,680
i don't know i'm not really sure what to

991
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,720
say to that but i basically get paid

992
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,319
online in amazon gift cards so i

993
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:26,480
often have like more money on my amazon

994
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,400
account than on my bank account and i

995
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,960
can't withdraw it because it's amazon

996
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,119
and

997
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,720
you have to buy stuff on amazon and i

998
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,200
don't want to buy stuff on amazon but

999
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,319
that's the only way to get paid

1000
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,640
and that's just frustration

1001
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,520
however it gets worse they're like new

1002
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,799
legal challenges

1003
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:48,240
or rather new legends legal challenges

1004
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,560
so i don't know

1005
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,319
first we're going to talk about sister

1006
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,078
foster sister foster is already in place

1007
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,200
so it's actually not new it's

1008
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,040
already two years old it is an amendment

1009
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:04,160
to the section 230.

1010
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:07,759
um section 230 in the u.s criminal law

1011
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:10,720
provides immunity for website publishers

1012
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,359
from third-party content that is the

1013
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,759
main

1014
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,078
reason like section 230 not sister fossa

1015
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,520
um section 230 is the main reason or

1016
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,920
consider the main reason

1017
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,440
why the internet took off that big and

1018
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,280
why the web

1019
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,599
2.0 is yeah or got a big thing because

1020
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,599
whoever is like hosting a website isn't

1021
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,079
reliable for the third party content

1022
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,800
and sister foster changed that it

1023
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,760
created an

1024
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,560
exception for um everything that assists

1025
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,079
facilitate

1026
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,560
or support sex trafficking and

1027
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,119
no one wants sex trafficking i'm not

1028
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,279
aware

1029
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,480
ever of anyone being like in favor of

1030
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,839
sex trafficking

1031
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,720
however it is um the question of sex

1032
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,240
trafficking

1033
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,319
is a little bit similar to what we had

1034
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,959
in germany like in 2009 when a lot of

1035
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,160
people

1036
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,280
um or some people um were very much in

1037
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,118
favor of like some kind of um stop signs

1038
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,320
on the internet for everything that's

1039
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,200
evil

1040
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,240
and that's basically some censorship

1041
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,879
infrastructure

1042
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,479
for back then child pornography or child

1043
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,960
abuse material because

1044
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,240
pornography is consensual and child

1045
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,240
abuse isn't consensual

1046
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,200
and so sister foster killed backpage

1047
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,119
um and craigslist in 2018. um craigslist

1048
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,480
was still there but it isn't available

1049
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,680
to sex workers anymore

1050
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,599
and backpage was a very commonly used

1051
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:39,919
website where you could run cheap ads

1052
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,480
um and we also a lot of people had like

1053
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,400
a very good community on backpage

1054
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,640
um to kind of just talk to each other

1055
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,599
and like figure out how to do stuff

1056
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,200
um and then we have earn it earn it is

1057
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,480
still in

1058
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,640
debate it isn't uh yeah it isn't

1059
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,400
signed into law or anything yet it is

1060
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,879
also um

1061
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:06,400
go an amendment to the section 230

1062
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,480
um and

1063
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,800
so far section 230 provides some

1064
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,680
liability from civil lawsuit related to

1065
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,000
the content

1066
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:19,598
of users so similar to

1067
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,640
to the original section 2030 like

1068
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:27,280
if you as a internet platform

1069
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:30,400
um had content by users that was like

1070
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,920
their content and they had to be

1071
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,839
yeah taking care of it and we had

1072
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,400
already the exception of sister foster

1073
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,078
that well

1074
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,400
it can't have anything with to do with

1075
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:44,079
sex trafficking

1076
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:47,760
but now what comes new to that is that

1077
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:51,440
lawsuits against service providers

1078
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,000
can be possible if they fail to deal

1079
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,599
with

1080
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,839
child sexual abuse material which is

1081
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,640
commonly known as child porn though porn

1082
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,680
is

1083
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,040
consensual so it is a child's sexual

1084
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,078
abuse material

1085
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,480
um and what that means is

1086
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,000
well the idea of it is kind of good so

1087
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,240
again no one wants to

1088
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,480
to see material of like abused children

1089
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,399
but what it does or what it probably

1090
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,440
will do is that a lot of sex work

1091
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,599
content

1092
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,480
and a lot of porn will be removed from

1093
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,160
the internet

1094
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:28,000
as maybe it could be who like how sure

1095
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,040
is it that no one will understand it

1096
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,680
as a child porn and maybe that will

1097
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,480
lead to like some lawsuits so probably

1098
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:40,960
easier to delete it

1099
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,960
and what comes to earn it as well is

1100
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,560
the lawsuits against service providers

1101
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,200
will um

1102
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,680
be possible if the service provider

1103
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,000
allows

1104
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,040
end-to-end encryption that is a point

1105
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,880
where a lot of

1106
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,880
civil society organizations

1107
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,320
got wind off and like was like yeah no

1108
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,920
that's like we can't

1109
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,839
we can't go into crypto wars again

1110
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,359
that's like not no way

1111
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:06,640
but there we are um and it is happening

1112
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,799
over

1113
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:13,839
yeah sex work stuff um

1114
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:17,200
then we have um ccr um

1115
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:21,279
it is short for a stop internet sexual

1116
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:24,879
explosion act and that is a rather

1117
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:28,319
new idea by two

1118
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,800
senators in the united states um

1119
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:32,960
is that sure they do want to deal with

1120
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,720
like a

1121
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:39,839
sexual sexual exploitation

1122
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,839
on film

1123
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:46,160
and it does so by making the age of

1124
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,599
consent for filming porn

1125
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:52,879
to be based on states instead of the

1126
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:56,480
federal laws and

1127
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,480
that doesn't sound that bad in the first

1128
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,319
but you know that in the u.s you still

1129
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,119
have child marriages

1130
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:04,079
you still have children being married

1131
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,119
and if that

1132
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,400
will get enacted and if that will be

1133
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:12,079
signed into law

1134
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,920
um pawn off children will actually

1135
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,800
become legal in the united states

1136
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,119
while try to work against it it kind of

1137
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,400
does

1138
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:23,920
the opposite and also

1139
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,000
what is part of it it has a mandatory

1140
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,839
registration for all porn performers

1141
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,200
so a little bit as what we have in

1142
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:32,880
germany already with our

1143
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,640
our paper as sex workers

1144
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,160
that is proposed in the united states

1145
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,240
for all porn performers

1146
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,078
um so the government does have like a

1147
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,720
registry of everyone who's ever done

1148
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,960
porn

1149
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,480
um and can check if they're like legal

1150
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,040
and everything is fine

1151
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,000
um and cecilia came out of these

1152
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,599
so-called

1153
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,720
war on porn what is the war on porn

1154
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,359
well we do talk about a lot about stuff

1155
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,118
and places like pornhub only fans or

1156
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,279
exams are that

1157
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,640
recently a lot in like media and like

1158
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,560
often seen as like

1159
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:08,879
evil um evil pawn platforms

1160
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,000
um and don't get me wrong the platforms

1161
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,400
are quite evil

1162
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,200
um i'm not aware of like any sex worker

1163
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,119
like being

1164
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,118
generally in favor of these platforms

1165
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,640
these platforms basically see sex

1166
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,560
workers as

1167
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,640
um click workers a little bit like i

1168
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:28,160
don't know what what amazon is doing

1169
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,040
pretty awfully with um yeah with all

1170
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,319
kind of

1171
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,000
technical talk um is happening there too

1172
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,400
so like oh yeah like

1173
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,760
they basically want content and we're

1174
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,880
gonna create it for them and they're

1175
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,240
gonna sell it

1176
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,119
and what happened um i guess most of you

1177
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,839
have heard about it

1178
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:47,760
in the beginning of december is that

1179
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:50,400
there was like a huge

1180
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,599
debate after an article by nicholas

1181
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,520
kristof

1182
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,200
in the new york times claiming that

1183
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,000
pornhub was like really evil and didn't

1184
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,230
deal with

1185
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,839
any kind of abuse material

1186
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:04,880
[Music]

1187
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:07,279
and that led to pornhub

1188
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,960
changing a policy that sex workers were

1189
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,920
asking for for years

1190
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,640
that you only could upload content to

1191
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,079
pornhub

1192
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:18,240
or all of mindgeeks websites

1193
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,839
if you are registered and if there's

1194
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,040
like some kind of id check

1195
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:26,160
because what a lot of porn people

1196
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,200
really hate on these platforms not so

1197
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,118
much on only fence but

1198
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,399
particularly like on pawnhub and xsumsta

1199
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,160
and basically all of mindgeek's porn

1200
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,960
porn sites is that you do have like a

1201
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:40,399
lot of illegal

1202
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,200
illegal uploads there it is a little bit

1203
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,960
like

1204
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,279
i don't know 10 years ago when a lot of

1205
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,240
people use like movie 2k

1206
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,400
or something to watch movies and the

1207
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,959
content industry was

1208
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,599
heavily arguing against it and that

1209
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,440
debate

1210
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,960
at some point kind of vanished because

1211
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,560
netflix came up and

1212
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,400
well torrenting didn't disappear and

1213
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,279
pirate bay is still there so you still

1214
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,119
can use it

1215
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:10,560
but most to most people netflix just got

1216
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:13,760
easier and more comfortable than using

1217
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:16,000
some kind of i don't know ad based shady

1218
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,200
website

1219
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,960
and that didn't happen with pawn yet so

1220
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,399
yeah it is a little bit the same with

1221
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,200
the exception that well

1222
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,480
the big movie companies in hollywood do

1223
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,200
have money to run

1224
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,319
big campaigns the pawn companies that

1225
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,040
have money are

1226
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:34,800
these and the people who create stuff

1227
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,000
for them

1228
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,599
left out to dry um

1229
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,440
but where's the war on porn actually

1230
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:44,720
coming from um

1231
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:47,839
it is called the so-called exodus cry

1232
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:51,200
which is like a strong religious

1233
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:52,400
um yeah strong religious christian

1234
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,078
fundamentalist

1235
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,079
group that created um earlier this year

1236
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,520
actually this year i think it's already

1237
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,880
some time ago i'm not sure

1238
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,000
um the hashtag trafficking hub to attack

1239
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,040
pornhub

1240
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,079
and nicholas kristoff who

1241
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:13,520
wrote the huge

1242
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,839
huge debated piece for the new york

1243
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,920
times

1244
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:21,839
basically took all the arguments from

1245
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,839
this christian fundamentalist group

1246
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,440
and while they try to say they're like

1247
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,800
against sex trafficking what they are is

1248
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,000
against all kind of sex work they're

1249
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,240
generally against porn

1250
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,560
and they're also very um very much

1251
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,879
against all kind of lgbt rights

1252
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,839
and they will always claim that no we as

1253
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,160
an organization

1254
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:41,759
we do not have a stand on lgbt rights we

1255
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,359
don't care about them

1256
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,839
but pretty much all of their members are

1257
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:48,880
very strong

1258
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:49,839
so that's where the war on pog porn

1259
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,319
comes from it's

1260
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,440
christian fundamentalists trying to

1261
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:56,079
center the internet

1262
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,480
and everything that has to do with sex

1263
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,760
because sex is evil

1264
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,640
so what do we do um

1265
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,160
[Music]

1266
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,640
more the question like why am i giving

1267
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,078
the talk for the one hand yeah i guess a

1268
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,680
lot of people will find it interesting

1269
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,760
to have some kind of insight

1270
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,279
in what tech for sex work means but it

1271
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,960
also the point like why i

1272
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:19,119
outed myself is we need help um

1273
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,200
on the one hand well we need to fight

1274
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,520
stigma we need to

1275
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,279
to be okay with sex workers being or

1276
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,160
doing their job

1277
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,160
but above that

1278
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,960
we need society generally to stop

1279
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,520
patronizing us

1280
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,400
we need to decide on our own what is

1281
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,160
good for us

1282
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,839
and what is not good for us and we need

1283
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,520
rights um

1284
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:46,799
to stop the the wrongs

1285
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:49,599
we need support from

1286
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,640
everyone who is in favor of us doing our

1287
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:55,200
jobs

1288
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,240
and i believe a lot of people who are

1289
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,040
watching this

1290
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,759
talk are watching porn maybe they're

1291
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,400
like not

1292
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,200
booking sex workers anymore because they

1293
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,760
did

1294
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,118
have a ditch a bit with porn coming

1295
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,599
around

1296
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,599
but porn is a part of sex work and if

1297
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:15,119
you want to

1298
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:17,200
have that option to book sex workers but

1299
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,599
also just to watch porn to enjoy that in

1300
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,000
a

1301
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,359
hopeful illegal way then you do have to

1302
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,680
to support us

1303
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:25,839
and you can do that by giving us money

1304
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,240
um like not me personally or like

1305
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:29,520
well for sure if you do want to book me

1306
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,118
you do have to pay me

1307
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,920
um but in the last year well we do have

1308
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,119
like the

1309
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,200
curvature situation um and the

1310
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,880
best the buffer ban saxabyte which is

1311
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,520
kind of the german

1312
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,000
sex workers union created an emergency

1313
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:49,040
fund for sex workers that are not liable

1314
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,480
um to any other emergency funds which

1315
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,240
are quite a lot for example me who was

1316
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,520
legally still a student and because i'm

1317
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,919
a student i can't

1318
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,800
um have any kind of of help from the

1319
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,880
government because

1320
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,400
basically i'm a student i can't even uh

1321
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,480
yeah apply for like

1322
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:09,440
a fundamental um support or hard sphere

1323
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,720
um but that isn't enough we also need

1324
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:14,160
the sex workers union

1325
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:18,558
best itself to be stronger to

1326
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,558
for to work for for better rights

1327
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,879
and similar organizations at the broofsa

1328
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,880
band also like on the european level

1329
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:28,559
that's the ic rse

1330
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:30,079

1331
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:34,160
collection of a lot of sex worker

1332
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:36,319
organizations um around in europe

1333
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,598
and that's like a collective the hacking

1334
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:41,119
hustling collective

1335
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:43,520
um in the united states that is

1336
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,119
working a lot on this topic on like the

1337
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,400
intersection of sex work

1338
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:51,920
um and hacking and tech tag

1339
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:54,079
and one very important part is the nswp

1340
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,480
that's the network of sex work projects

1341
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:59,520

of states

1411
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:40,079
say that it's like oh yeah like in an

1412
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,599
environment like 300 meters

1413
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,359
around like every school in like every

1414
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,559
kindergarten and stuff and whenever

1415
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,200

something

1417
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,200
the area where you can work does change

1418
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:52,240
or like if some closes or thing

1419
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,118
you do have like more place again um and

1420
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,879
basically it's like

1421
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,880
no one really cares about it and we just

1422
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,960
try to not get caught

1423
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,559
okay so there's a job for you open

1424
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,520
street map hackers out there

00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,760
yes please do something about it write

1426
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,839
an

1427
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,119
algorithm that puts a circle of 300

1428
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:10,558
meters around every school

1429
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:13,760
and uh maybe that helps so that was uh

1430
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,160
tech and uh sex work definitely the next

1431
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,079
one

1432
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:19,200
is is the new aim of the shuffle a big

1433
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,839
watch in the

1434
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:25,118
bank transfer not a big repression for

1435
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:26,960
political groups like hydra in germany

1436
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,160
they need donation for the works okay i

1437
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:32,880
don't know what the

1438
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:34,879
new aim of shuffle is me neither uh

1439
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,960
guess what they are what i thought they

1440
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,119
might be referring to as

1441
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,319
the debate um that happened in germany

1442
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:43,680
uh quite a lot about

1443
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:46,160
um ngos being able to um

1444
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,359
to run as a non-profit which for the

1445
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,799
wolves foreboding for example

1446
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:50,880
was never the case because it is

1447
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,040
basically there for their members

1448
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,240
um and for sex workers and therefore was

1449
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,839
never legal for

1450
00:52:54,240 --> 00:53:00,959
um as an ngo or like a non-government

1451
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:02,078
uh no non uh um non-profit um and

1452
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,160
therefore if you do

1453
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,119
spend money to the best which i very

1454
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,118
much um

1455
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,160
encourage you to do um you do not get

1456
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:11,680
any kind of um

1457
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:13,440
tax relief because yeah it's there for

1458
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,399
sex workers and sex workers are another

1459
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,599
donation

1460
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,290
okay yeah okay one last

1461
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:25,860
is it's an in german the question

1462
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:25,860
[Music]

1463
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:29,839
is

1464
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,880
so in english yeah how important would

1465
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,920
be

1466
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:51,119
a a cash like digital app

1467
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:53,680
to transfer money i'm

1468
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,640
not aware of anything concerning tech

1469
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,980
and sex work

1470
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,920
that i'd say is more

1471
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:00,640
[Music]

1472
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,559
you or like more needed than that um

1473
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:05,200
they're like a lot of things that could

1474
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:05,839
turn bad rather like on the legal side

1475
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,399
um

1476
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:09,119
and like turn down like more platforms

1477
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,880
and stuff

1478
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,720
but on the development side i'd say

1479
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,440
there's like nothing more important than

1480
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,558
than creating something that we can

1481
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,960
online

1482
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,599
kind of anonymous use money and well

1483
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,359
yeah

1484
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:27,040
bitcoin isn't really doing it and paypal

1485
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:29,680
doesn't want to do it yeah sure okay um

1486
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,640
yeah so that was uh i have a question

1487
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,359
okay there's one more

1488
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:35,520
from the uh i'm not sure online because

1489
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:39,279
i took a mick quote

1490
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:42,400
okay yeah you talked about uh

1491
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,599
the usa and sweden how about germany are

1492
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:47,040
you aware about

1493
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:49,200
people like mr lauterbach who want to

1494
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:52,640
use the

1495
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:56,640
pandemic or health

1496
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:58,879
reason to prohibit sex work forever

1497
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,799
well there's like a debate or rather was

1498
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,640
a debate about the swedish model in

1499
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:05,759
germany it is a little bit pushed back

1500
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:08,480
so currently we are not that

1501
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,280
much on a threat anymore um there will

1502
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,720
be like a

1503
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:16,079
um uh evolution um

1504
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:20,000
um or like revision on the german law

1505
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:22,559
um in 20 end of 2021 i believe

1506
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,920
i think it was like implemented in 2017

1507
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,760
so like five years later

1508
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,280
um it was like meant to kind of like be

1509
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:30,240
replaced or like

1510
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,480
be said and there will come up some

1511
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,279
political debate um where to continue

1512
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,839
with the

1513
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,280
rather recent or like 2017 german

1514
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:41,839
prostitution law

1515
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:44,319
uh or prostitution protection law um

1516
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:46,400
but yeah um so far like currently it's a

1517
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:48,720
little bit

1518
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,680
like it is not as urgent it is still an

1519
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,680
issue um

1520
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,440
and we still need to to be very much

1521
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,520
aware of what's going on there

1522
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,280
um but i believe at least i can compare

1523
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,520
to a lot of other european countries

1524
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,799
germany is a little bit on the safe side

1525
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,920
currently

1526
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:06,559
um but yeah lauterbach was quite

1527
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,240
annoying with like his super spreader

1528
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,720
claim for sex workers which

1529
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:14,078
does not have any kind of proper data um

1530
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:16,000
to support that but he did

1531
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,280
if we do want to have more questions or

1532
