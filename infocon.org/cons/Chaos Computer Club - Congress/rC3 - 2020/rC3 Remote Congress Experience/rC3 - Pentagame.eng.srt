bitcoin and welcome

5
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,439
um

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,840
workshop and yet is

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
foreign

8
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,920
so last

9
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,000
this is pet the game here and these are

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,119
my slides perfect thank you very much

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,320
for having me last time i held a similar

12
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,840
presentation on congress which we had in

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,559
leipzig and it was also scheduled in

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,560
english

15
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,400
i actually asked is there anybody here

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,079
who doesn't speak english and there was

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,000
nobody there so

18
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,119
i remember i decided to stick with

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,680
english even though

20
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,720
most of the members of the audience

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,400
actually were

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,079
capable of understanding it in german

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,680
but my slides are in english so beg your

24
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,798
pardon

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,240
penta game is actually um i'm going to

26
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,439
talk about pentagon

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,399
which is as mentioned a strategic board

28
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,279
game which

29
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,000
has some really interesting properties

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,000
and

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
it has been developed over a number of

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,680
years

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,280
last year at congress we had prototypes

34
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,840
since then we had a

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,000
successful kickstarter campaign so we

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,959
actually have

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,679
pentagon copies now which is really cool

38
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,520
uh

39
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,760
we could not quite have a release this

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,720
year obviously because of the pandemic

41
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,239
so

42
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,720
game fairs and so far flat however i'm

43
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,280
going to

44
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,359
talk a little bit about um the genesis

45
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,520
of the game so this is how the game came

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,920
into existence and the existence of the

47
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,160
game actually also some words about a

48
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,000
possible pre-existence

49
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,400
because there are some things that make

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,239
me think that or believe

51
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,760
give us reason to believe that there was

52
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,200
an ancient board game that must have

53
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,959
worked pretty much along the same lines

54
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,280
so this is the fun part and then comes

55
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,360
the essence part um

56
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,640
which is more the game theoretical point

57
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,280
of view because

58
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,958
having developed and played pentagon

59
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,840
many hundreds and hundreds of times

60
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,680
really

61
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,120
obviously we have a lot of questions

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,159
like does it always end

63
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,080
is it and how complex is it really um

64
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,959
does it play in the same league as other

65
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,640
games

66
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,000
things like that so that's the more

67
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,000
mathematical part

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,840
and i'll finish with some links at the

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,800
end

70
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,440
so the genesis of pentagon how did it

71
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,440
come

72
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,640
into being that actually started a long

73
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,440
time ago some

74
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,200
years ago really um the first thing was

75
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,280
about 1996

76
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,359
and i wondered because i had these you

77
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,239
know as we all have as kids

78
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,840
these um game collection things and you

79
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,159
see these classic board games this is

80
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,519
just a picture that you find anywhere

81
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,879
and these games are kind of different to

82
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,519
um yeah author games or german style

83
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,079
board games which come out every year in

84
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,480
that

85
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,200
they don't really have a topic as such

86
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,518
because

87
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,359
you know inventor games typically author

88
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,440
games have topics like um

89
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,080
the carawan and the desert or the

90
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,319
ancient arctic league or stuff like that

91
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,239
while these classic games seem to be

92
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:02,000
different in many respects

93
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,319
and the most obvious uh aspect about

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,080
this is obviously they are abstract

95
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,839
and they also have some sort of

96
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,000
geometric patterns

97
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,959
and you see this particular one which

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,720
you know ludo

99
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,360
based on the ancient indian game of

100
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,040
patches is basically circular you run in

101
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,840
a circle

102
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,799
then you have games like this one

103
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,159
chinese checkers

104
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,758
or hailmar which is basically triangular

105
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,280
and you obviously have quite a lot of

106
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,320
games which are

107
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,880
played on the square shapes the most

108
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,000
prominent

109
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,440
in the west at least is chess but go

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,600
is certainly a game of the same family

111
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,520
so these are basic fundamental geometric

112
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,360
shapes and if you look at it basically

113
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,120
you find out that this is actually

114
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,680
something like a

115
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,040
a family of mathematical structures

116
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,040
because they are

117
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,160
well you know they have this geometric

118
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,000
patterns

119
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,360
regular n shaped patterns

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,680
and then you have games with them so you

121
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,639
have linear circular as mentioned

122
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,840
uh you have triangular games and you

123
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,919
have square games

124
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,599
and you even have hexagonal games quite

125
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,080
quite popular today where

126
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,759
we're playing on hexagonal shapes so

127
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,199
when you look at this so as i looked in

128
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,160
that i actually asked myself

129
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,800
what about this pentagonal shape how

130
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,000
about

131
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,960
the number five is kind of suspiciously

132
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,400
missing and by that they i didn't know

133
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,280
of any game that was actually played on

134
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,880
the pentagram

135
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,880
or pentagon shape so this was the quest

136
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,919
this is possible that there could be a

137
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,120
game

138
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,840
just as simple just as fun just as um

139
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,800
deep and entertaining as these other

140
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,960
games

141
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,880
but played on the pentagram or pentagon

142
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,758
shape

143
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,800
so when you look at the pentagram then

144
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,560
you know what you do is

145
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,479
what i have done obviously is draw a

146
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,960
pentagram and a pentagram and

147
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,560
to draw a pentagram as anyone knows who

148
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,919
has ever endeavored to

149
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,199
try is not that easy so you see

150
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,440
this is a pentagram construction and as

151
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,400
you quickly find out is

152
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,919
the lengths in the pentagram so this

153
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,679
length

154
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,198
and list and this length and so on so

155
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,000
the long and the short

156
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,680
distances within the pentagram they are

157
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,039
what we call incommensurable

158
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,360
so this is not a rational relationship

159
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,400
is actually the golden section you find

160
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,080
the golden section

161
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,840
between this short line and that long

162
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,039
line and also between

163
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,080
this line and the entire line and and so

164
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,680
on all over

165
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,479
this this pentagram and since this is an

166
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,280
irrational

167
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,800
relationship that means it's not so easy

168
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,919
to just make stops

169
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,600
on this on this board that have the same

170
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,359
size

171
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,039
so obviously drawing a pentagram putting

172
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,639
some stops on it and trying to come up

173
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,919
with the game

174
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,440
brings you to the point where you find

175
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,159
out this is actually mathematically a

176
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,160
bit challenging

177
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,120
so since the length ah this is this

178
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,919
golden section relationship and no one

179
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,280
stop

180
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,880
a size of stop actually uh fits

181
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,960
so what you would do is then okay you

182
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,159
say maybe we have different size stops

183
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,758
in the middle on the corners and uh

184
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,360
here but with two sizes of stops you

185
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,080
still don't really get it

186
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,720
since um and that's what i tried out so

187
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,719
basically

188
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,759
this is the prototype gallery this is

189
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,520
just what i found at home

190
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,599
once i actually have quite a lot of

191
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,719
prototypes so my first photo tribe the

192
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,120
first very first

193
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,759
pentagram pentagon prototype is this one

194
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,360
here

195
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,520
and you see basically what i've done is

196
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,160
i just got colorful stickers and i stuck

197
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,159
them on

198
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,319
and i figured out that this sizes here

199
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,039
kind of that doesn't really quite fit

200
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,319
so um then this one here actually looks

201
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,080
already much better

202
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,360
and then all the at the end it looks

203
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,878
like this so you see this

204
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,879
there's been quite a lot of development

205
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,319
in the middle

206
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,919
to solve this math i don't really want

207
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,479
to get too much into it uh

208
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,680
just um this is the corner condition

209
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,080
because what you find out

210
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,080
you have these you have an 18 degrees

211
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,960
angle obviously in the pentagram

212
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,198
and you have these stops along the line

213
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,758
so if these stops are supposed to just

214
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,479
meet here in point c that means that

215
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,840
this

216
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,120
corner circle has to have the ratio of a

217
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,840
square root of 5

218
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,120
if this one has the radius of 1. so this

219
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,719
is the corner condition

220
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,360
you can fit that into the entire

221
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,560
pentagram golden section equation

222
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,240
together with the number of stops you

223
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,800
want to have and then you actually come

224
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,160
to

225
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,360
these values so the terms are actually

226
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,720
quite complicated

227
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,719
and i must confess that i had some

228
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,039
sleepless nights until i finally found

229
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,120
them

230
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,640
and it was a bit of a hurricane moment

231
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,159
that also explains

232
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,399
why probably there haven't been many

233
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,799
pentagonal pentagram-shaped ball games

234
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,799
before

235
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,760
so that's let's talk about the existence

236
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,079
because this is what we've got now

237
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,519
we have this well you've seen some of

238
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,120
the prototypes actually contained

239
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,720
colored stops this is because um when

240
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,720
when we started the development trying

241
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,320
out different rule sets we found out

242
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,880
actually to rule dies and

243
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,560
and count numbers is really tiring so we

244
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,000
basically had colored eyes and you just

245
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,160
roll a dice a color

246
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,920
and you move to the top of that color

247
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,680
and then later we found out that this is

248
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,599
not even necessary and the whole game

249
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,680
also works perfectly fine

250
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,320
just without um these colors and that's

251
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,279
the final design

252
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,040
so um what is penta game now how does it

253
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,120
how is it played i mean this is the

254
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,240
geometry and obviously the journey

255
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,279
towards a

256
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,240
rule set that would also work was a very

257
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,040
long one so it

258
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,640
took really some decades and let me just

259
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,480
quickly explain for this i've got this

260
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,600
table here set up

261
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,720
for you and i want to just so if you can

262
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,480
have that different

263
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,160
picture yeah thank you here

264
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,680
here you see the pentagram the printer

265
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,480
game pretty much this is a large table

266
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,079
that we use

267
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,000
at sea base it's filtering out this is

268
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,080
actually green here but

269
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
yeah thank you it's a transparency

270
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,680
now what it really is is um it's quite

271
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,200
simple to explain and i'll just i'm

272
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,800
going into the basics so

273
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,320
basically you play one shape so i could

274
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,719
be this

275
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,240
ball here and i have a blue ball that

276
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,160
starts on blue i have a red ball that

277
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,440
starts on red i have a white one

278
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,920
on white a yellow one and a green one

279
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,120
and what they really want to do what my

280
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,160
aim is now

281
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,279
to get this yellow one here the red one

282
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,719
here

283
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,399
green one wants to travel to green and

284
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,920
the blue one could travel any which way

285
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,279
it wants to blue

286
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,760
and the white to white which per se is

287
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,240
simple

288
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,600
but since we have obviously you're not

289
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,800
alone on the board

290
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,600
so you have another player that

291
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,920
typically has

292
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,320
another shape so this is important

293
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,719
you're not one color you want shape

294
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:49,920
and has the exact same objective

295
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,440
so now the thing is you can't just move

296
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,920
to where you want to move

297
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,920
but you have to get rid of the blocks

298
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,079
and what you can do now when it's your

299
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,399
turn and say i'm this glass ball and i

300
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,959
want to start so i can choose any of my

301
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,360
pieces like say this one and i i'm not

302
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,279
allowed to jump over anything

303
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,279
so i can either just go here or i can

304
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,000
just go here something like that

305
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,680
but i can also just beat these ones and

306
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,760
then place them somewhere else

307
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,880
where they might block my opponent more

308
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,959
than myself

309
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,959
like say here or maybe here

310
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,279
and the other move that's possible is i

311
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,519
can always swap to a jack in pieces so

312
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,399
here this one cannot jump over that red

313
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,800
one

314
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,880
so either i stop somewhere on the way or

315
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,479
if i beat myself here then i

316
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,480
swap position so these are the two basic

317
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,399
possible moves and when it's free when

318
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,560
the corner is free then i can also turn

319
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,839
corners like this blue piece to now

320
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:52,160
reach the blue stop replace that

321
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:55,120
move out for moving out you then get

322
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,040
another block a grey block that is to

323
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,440
have the number of pieces on the board

324
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,519
vaguely the same so now positioning this

325
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,399
is a major strategic aspect of the game

326
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,720
because you can see

327
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,320
this blue one could also now go to blue

328
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,160
this yellow one could now go here to

329
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,720
yellow this red one could go to red

330
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,680
so i put this here and hence making it

331
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,279
possible for

332
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,519
my opponent to get anyone out

333
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,959
so a fairly simple game really uh good

334
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,000
fun to play

335
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,119
and yeah thank you so that's basically

336
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,600
all the rules

337
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,360
in a nutshell can i have back to the

338
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,600
slides yes thanks

339
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:34,720
and where if i put my pointer here

340
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,320
okay so this is her this is the game and

341
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,440
since it's inception it has really been

342
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,360
played hundreds and hundreds and

343
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,240
hundreds of times

344
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,279
um we had tournaments um you know lots

345
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,880
of fun

346
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,160
and yeah i know that some of you are

347
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,839
maybe now listening

348
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,680
might already have the experience that

349
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,839
this is actually a fun game so

350
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,719
the because the ultimate test for a game

351
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,120
obviously is

352
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,480
whether it actually is fun so whether

353
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,600
it's entertaining

354
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,040
um whether it gives you the opportunity

355
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,240
to talk to people have interesting

356
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,800
conversation

357
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,320
and also whether it's well complex

358
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,479
enough to entertain you

359
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,480
but not so hard that you think i have so

360
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,600
much to think about it

361
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:19,200
okay so this actually really does work

362
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,079
that's the empirical test so um

363
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,839
we had this um penta game obviously the

364
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,479
idea we had lots of prototypes and some

365
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,399
of you

366
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,079
who have been on last year's congress

367
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,320
might have these uh bagged

368
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,199
prototypes so i basically made a hundred

369
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,800
of these and

370
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,800
sold them and gave them away and so on

371
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,800
and made tournaments and all that

372
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,880
and then finally we said we ought to

373
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,439
have a crowdfunding campaign

374
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,360
to get this whole thing off the ground

375
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,600
and at this point i would like to

376
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,519
say thank you particularly to everyone

377
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,320
who has supported all this

378
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,320
developments and particularly the

379
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,560
crowdfunding campaign

380
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,760
the first five in particular the first

381
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,680
five were the five

382
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,360
donators who donated the much the most

383
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,160
and they have this

384
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,160
golden hats

385
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,439
thank you very much

386
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,199
[Music]

387
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,360
so this is what we got now this is the

388
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,839
pentagram that i showed earlier this is

389
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,519
the

390
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,279
well these are three of them we actually

391
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,519
have it really made by ludofuck this is

392
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,680
the company in germany that also makes

393
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,000
games like settlers and we also have

394
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,040
these translated rules in

395
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,040
1615 different languages in latin in low

396
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,719
german and indonesian in arabic and

397
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,839
stuff like that all types that nicely

398
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,079
with latex so

399
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,839
it's good fun and pretty much

400
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,319
self-explanatory and lovely lovely

401
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,760
little pieces also we've got grease and

402
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,440
and hedgehogs and stuff so this is what

403
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,120
we have and i'm really happy about this

404
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,800
the only thing is obviously

405
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,320
we were meant to have a party we were

406
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,160
meant to have a release we were meant to

407
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,199
go to fairs and all this fell flat

408
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,079
because it's them 2020.

409
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,199
so thank you for being here and we will

410
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,399
actually we

411
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,399
have this somehow later

412
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,560
this is pretty much what i wanted to say

413
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,680
about the existence of this game

414
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,160
but now i'm talking about the

415
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,079
pre-existence because obviously in the

416
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,800
whole process of developing this

417
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,079
i had a look at the pentagram as such

418
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,199
and the cultural history of the

419
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,279
pentagram

420
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,800
the colors associated with the corners

421
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,480
within the pentagram

422
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,420
and so on and there was quite a lot of

423
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,760
stuff to develop to discover

424
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,519
[Music]

425
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,120
and i find it's quite fascinating

426
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,160
because basically

427
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,360
um these the the pentagon the pentagram

428
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,160
in antique times was the symbol of the

429
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,800
pythagoreans

430
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,160
is something that we know from lukian we

431
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,160
also know that these corners were

432
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,199
associated with power or even five

433
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,880
elements

434
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,800
and who's into that i really really

435
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,079
recommend this book by eva

436
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,359
from 1917 fantastic so

437
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,800
taking this together there are

438
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,560
there are actually some chances that

439
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,240
there could have been something similar

440
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,000
but there isn't i mean at least in the

441
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,600
archaeological record we do not find

442
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,959
anything that has anything

443
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:07,040
that looks like anything like it

444
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,880
but we have this quote from uh julius

445
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,240
again pollock's himself then quotes

446
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,439
sophocles

447
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,160
and you know i save us to try to read

448
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,880
this out

449
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,240
but it's pretty much uh intelligible and

450
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,439
basically what it means is that there

451
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,399
was a five-line board game in antiquity

452
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,320
where each player had five pieces and

453
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,800
this was also not exactly the same as

454
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,800
dice games so and this existed

455
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,399
there has been a lot of discussion about

456
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,800
what this was throughout the centuries

457
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,800
you can

458
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,839
go back really in the earliest game

459
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,319
theoretically

460
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,759
literature people say was it pentagon or

461
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,639
was it five parallel lines and so on

462
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,440
um well i mean you can still we given

463
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,079
the fact that

464
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,360
the golden proportion and also geometry

465
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,160
was really important

466
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,880
for the ancient greeks plato and

467
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,519
platonic

468
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,040
solids spring to mind and also the

469
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,079
importance of

470
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,319
playing gameplay for this for culture

471
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:08,079
and for the origins of culture

472
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:10,000
think yuan hoising arm and the fact that

473
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,198
the symbol of the pythagoreans was the

474
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,640
pentagram

475
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,319
makes you actually believe that this

476
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,839
could could well fit

477
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,280
into what we see here

478
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,678
we don't have any pentagon

479
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,039
pentagram-shaped objects from

480
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,480
antiquity at all which well

481
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,480
probably has something to do with the

482
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,000
fact that as you know from lukian it was

483
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,840
a pythagorean symbol

484
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,480
and the pythagoreans were later in

485
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,600
history uh considered to be heroics and

486
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,520
so on

487
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,280
again i don't want to dive into too much

488
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,000
ever you might know already

489
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,200
you know associations about pentagrams

490
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,200
pentagrams

491
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,559
and people are pretty much sentimental

492
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,520
about it still

493
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,720
i remember um i was playing this game in

494
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,320
the pubs once

495
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,799
and there were some people looking at us

496
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,399
and they're like what what are you doing

497
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,480
and we're like yeah we play this game

498
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,600
it's a pentagon and they were like oh we

499
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,000
don't like it because

500
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,559
we are neo druids and we were

501
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,240
desecrating the holy pentagram

502
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,639
by a game so people are a little bit

503
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,400
sentimental and superstitious even about

504
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,760
these things and at this point i just

505
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,000
want to tell you i'm really not

506
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,080
superstitious for me this is a beautiful

507
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,360
geometric shape and so far no demons

508
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,600
have been

509
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,559
coming at us for playing this instead

510
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,439
it's actually

511
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,399
from its history of a pythagorean system

512
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,720
symbol

513
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,400
more a symbol of of advanced science and

514
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,679
mathematics and stuff like that

515
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,840
for me and probably also for you

516
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,200
so why was uh no such and i must say i

517
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,799
had an interesting

518
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,240
discussion with ulrich schedler about

519
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,559
this who wrote

520
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,520
about the antique game paseo this

521
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,520
pentagrammer these five line games

522
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,120
now we don't have an archaeological

523
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,559
record um

524
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,239
but this could be because it never

525
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,840
existed but it could also be that they

526
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,039
all just vanished either because it's

527
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,720
just been

528
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,320
you know by material they were drawn on

529
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,480
char by chalk or

530
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,520
by chance or on purpose because of the

531
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,640
meaning of it

532
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,960
so this is explainable and henceforth it

533
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,880
is

534
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,000
possible that this is actually a

535
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,559
recreation of a classic board game

536
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,160
um which then was called pattaya and if

537
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,760
you read plato and you know there are

538
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,080
many references to this game

539
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,120
and all kind of fits so this would fit

540
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,120
like a puzzle

541
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,678
not saying it is this but it's a

542
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,439
nevertheless pretty beautiful thought

543
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:32,000
this is a kind of platonic game

544
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,840
so that being said

545
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,840
how much time do i have like how long is

546
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,840
this now

547
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,720
30 minutes okay thank you so i'm i'm

548
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,320
trying not to rush too much through this

549
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,320
because i know some of that is

550
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:53,360
new for some of you so now

551
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,559
we have this game and it works it's fun

552
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,159
and it's interesting and we've been

553
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,320
playing this and quite a lot of very

554
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,840
bright minds have also been playing this

555
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,120
excessively really and um we figure out

556
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,840
that we get better

557
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,799
but also we know that nobody actually

558
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,320
knows how to play this perfectly

559
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,080
and this is quite surprising because

560
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,280
normally you would think you know if you

561
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,280
have games like nim

562
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,120
you know they analyze it then you know

563
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,360
how it's actually to be played

564
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,320
and it's solved and you know game over

565
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,158
in a way

566
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,600
this has so far not happened with penta

567
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,840
game we are still

568
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,678
learning there are different openings

569
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,120
and stuff like that that happens

570
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:33,200
it's quite fun so

571
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,959
my question was really is this game

572
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,799
actually really worth producing it or is

573
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,640
it just a bad idea

574
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:41,120
so when you think about that again

575
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,559
brings us back to the initial thought

576
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,479
different classic board games have

577
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,960
certain properties

578
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,320
you know remember chess and and chinese

579
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,840
checkers and all this

580
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,840
so this is really a seminal article from

581
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,039
mr thompson defining the abstract

582
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,399
talking about this and he basically was

583
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,919
the first one to come up with

584
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,600
these qualities so basically you say

585
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,640
every every proper

586
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,240
board game has depth which means it's

587
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,240
actually interesting enough it's

588
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,320
it produces riddles like you're posing a

589
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,520
riddle and the other player has to solve

590
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,678
it find the best move

591
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,799
which then poses a riddle to you and it

592
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:18,240
has enough depth to not be trivial

593
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,120
it also has to have clarity clarity easy

594
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,440
rules so this

595
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,239
something we definitely have then we

596
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,240
have to have drama which means

597
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,240
well i mean a counter example would be

598
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,960
monopoly who wins at the beginning wins

599
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,159
at the end

600
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:36,000
and that's clear pretty pretty soon so

601
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,200
um it has to have

602
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,880
someone who's not in the lead must

603
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,280
basically have a chance to get into the

604
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,360
lead

605
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,720
so there must be surprises and and

606
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,000
action

607
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,039
and then obviously there's another

608
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,880
necessary condition which is

609
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,360
decisiveness

610
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,080
and as game inventors we know this and

611
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,918
if you have

612
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,760
ever tried to come up with a game you

613
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,679
find out it's pretty

614
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,879
easy to not have decisiveness so

615
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,919
basically that means

616
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,960
it always ends in a draw or something

617
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,080
like that so the question is

618
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,520
or it doesn't end at all so this is

619
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,179
actually quite interesting because

620
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,240
um can we really prove that over sense

621
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,679
[Music]

622
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,320
so this has also been discussed a little

623
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,039
bit um thompson himself also had later

624
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,840
added a

625
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:21,200
fourth one which is elegance uh cameron

626
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,879
brown now talks about talks about

627
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,480
which is like an asian idea of

628
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,280
aesthetics

629
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,320
personally i believe like rather um

630
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,320
sublimeness

631
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,360
uh as opposed to rather just be

632
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,760
beautiful

633
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,760
and also naratsu which is something like

634
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,600
drama for me would be more important

635
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,600
that actually stories evolve on the on

636
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,280
the board game that pieces suddenly

637
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,120
become important that you feel almost

638
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,240
like oh this is my most important power

639
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,320
and i love it so much

640
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,080
things like that actually make games

641
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,600
really good

642
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,039
some of this we can prove and i just

643
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,000
want to talk a little bit about depth

644
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,600
because depth

645
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,240
this is obviously what you do when you

646
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,559
um when you start uh

647
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,320
talking about it and looking at it what

648
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,918
are the um

649
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,678
what are the different opening moves and

650
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,280
how many options are there can i maybe

651
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,400
learn these and find out which is the

652
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,760
best one

653
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,000
so i want to talk a little bit about the

654
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,440
depth of the game

655
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,200
and there are different ways of

656
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,960
measuring this depth obviously you have

657
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,720
state space complexity

658
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,440
average bunching factor game three

659
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,919
complexity or even the complexity

660
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,720
class so here i've got sketched out so

661
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,240
basically you can

662
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,320
either ask yourself how many possible

663
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,159
positions are there

664
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,678
how many options do i have when it's my

665
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,600
turn

666
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,200
what's the size of the game tree so how

667
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,840
many different games are there actually

668
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,039
possible

669
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,720
in this in this whole this is just like

670
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,440
always five different ways it can take

671
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,159
or is it

672
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,799
that we have billions and finally the

673
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,080
hardness

674
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,080
for an algorithm to solve this is it

675
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,240
that we just don't know the best way or

676
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,399
is it that we cannot know it and those

677
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,799
who have been observing alphago although

678
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,880
they know what i'm talking about

679
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,720
so i had a look at all these different

680
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,440
things

681
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,039
obviously it's a little bit difficult to

682
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,720
actually analyze this because you have

683
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,720
to have some assumptions about

684
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,240
what actually constitutes a possible

685
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,840
move

686
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,520
or a possible position so you have the

687
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,959
illegal positions the legal moves it's

688
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,879
like anything you can do

689
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,240
but then some of them is plainly idiotic

690
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,640
so you might not

691
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,240
take that into account so you have

692
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,600
reasonable moves which is like okay that

693
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,080
makes sense and maybe that makes sense

694
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,158
and maybe

695
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,279
you know but where do you draw the line

696
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,320
is probably

697
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:30,159
a matter of how well you play

698
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,639
and a subset of that again is the

699
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,679
perfect move and our game theory tells

700
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,240
us there must be

701
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,039
one perfect move one perfect way of

702
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,200
playing chess

703
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,480
and you would always win the thing is in

704
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,679
chess and in go we know that

705
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,000
this exists a priori but we don't know

706
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,679
it

707
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,520
so we can prove that it doesn't that we

708
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,679
don't know this so what we are dealing

709
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,679
here with this

710
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,039
so um you know trying to get these

711
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,159
different numbers and figures for

712
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,919
pentagon obviously

713
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,400
requires some assumptions about what is

714
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,720
reasonable and now what is reasonable

715
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,720
for

716
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,640
for pentagon typically you have two ways

717
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,799
of opening moves either you

718
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,360
go into the center and you eat one of

719
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,279
those blocks that you put somewhere else

720
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,479
which you put on one of the 20 lines

721
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,480
actually

722
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,720
or you do the swap move so you basically

723
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,559
just swap swap two pieces here on the

724
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,240
ring on the outer rim

725
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,840
this is the two reasonable opening moves

726
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,600
so the the guy who starts actually

727
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,039
doesn't really have much of an advantage

728
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,279
here because he can either do this

729
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,240
all that it's a little bit like in chess

730
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,600
you have open games

731
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:33,200
closed games e2e4 d2 d4

732
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,559
like this um so i mean this is

733
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,159
interesting because at the beginning you

734
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,360
think oh it's quite trivial

735
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,559
it's just symmetric doesn't really

736
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,279
matter but this is the replace branch

737
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,080
so i play a replacement first i go into

738
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,760
the center

739
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,639
i take the block i put it one or 20

740
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,120
lines now my opponent can then maybe do

741
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
a swap

742
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,039
he's got five different ways of doing

743
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,400
this and then maybe i've got four

744
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,080
different ways of doing a swap because

745
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,159
i'm not going to do the same

746
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,960
so multiplying this out you already get

747
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,400
like 400 different positions

748
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,880
and this applies also for the other

749
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,120
branches here so you see

750
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,080
that even if i in this bunch of replace

751
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,760
games i play

752
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,678
you play i play we can have up to 800

753
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,440
000 different positions on the board

754
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,679
and these are actually different to one

755
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,720
another they are not the same

756
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,600
trust me so this is the same for the

757
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,720
swap branch

758
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,320
pretty similar big bit big figures

759
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,080
so you can say like okay how many

760
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,158
options do i have because here i've got

761
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,120
three there i've got a hundred they've

762
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,320
got 200

763
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,399
so how you know how big is it so

764
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,320
we get two different estimations of the

765
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,840
size of the game tree and the complexity

766
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,840
of the game

767
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,279
and so the game tree is just like this

768
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,080
you basically go from one position to

769
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,840
the next and

770
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,678
the other ones or you could have the

771
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,918
state space where it's actually possible

772
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,960
where each possible position is only

773
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,880
just once

774
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,400
so you can have game three complexity or

775
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,960
state space complexity which

776
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,000
you know this basically means that here

777
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,200
there is no history

778
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,919
and it doesn't matter how you got to

779
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,600
this point well here you see u is twice

780
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,039
so basically that means you have some

781
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,360
sort of a memory this

782
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,360
this the so the game three complexity

783
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,719
asks how many different games are there

784
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,559
and this basically means how many

785
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,240
different reasonable positions exist

786
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,240
so how does it go so basically state

787
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,640
space i basically tipped the um

788
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,840
this graphic here on its side and then

789
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,559
it comes to something like that so

790
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,559
basically

791
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,480
seeing that we start from a very ordered

792
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,399
position then we do either swap or

793
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,399
replace and swap replace and

794
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,559
different moves and it branches out like

795
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,678
massively really really really large

796
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,918
and then it boils down again and at the

797
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,080
end

798
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,760
you funnel into the actual winning or

799
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,399
losing position so you got

800
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,679
one winning and the other one so we

801
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,719
don't really know

802
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,559
how what's what what shape this has

803
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,240
but what we can know is we can actually

804
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,918
think about how many positions do we

805
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,279
have here in the middle

806
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,440
so that is this one so here you got the

807
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,480
number of total positions which is

808
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,240
basically the idea

809
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,559
i just scatter pieces randomly on the

810
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,640
board how many positions do i get

811
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,000
well i mean you know you can say okay

812
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,200
for two players

813
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,080
and for uh 100 stops you get

814
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,360
this number so that's quite an upper

815
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,240
limit because there cannot be more than

816
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,559
that

817
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,240
and that means basically that's a number

818
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,120
larger than the number of atoms in this

819
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,960
my body

820
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,559
all the stars in the entire visible

821
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,799
universe

822
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,720
so there's quite a lot of positions and

823
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,918
also if you say maybe half of this

824
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,760
makes no sense but then you're still in

825
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,520
the same order of magnitude

826
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,960
or if you say only a tenth of that makes

827
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,760
sense then you've got 10 to the

828
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,760
power of 25 which is you know a little

829
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,158
bit less

830
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,679
so this alone shows that it's quite

831
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,000
complex and these are basically all the

832
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,919
nodes

833
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,679
that are in here from which you can then

834
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,520
deduce other things like the

835
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,760
the the average branching factor and so

836
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,080
on so how does that actually come out so

837
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,399
state space complexity of games logo

838
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,720
intense so you've got different state

839
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,639
space complexity measures

840
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,000
and most of these are basically just

841
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,480
take them from the internet

842
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,399
and it's not quite comparable not that

843
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,679
easy to compare since uh

844
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,520
you don't really know what method these

845
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,399
people have been using

846
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,679
so here i see basically we are kind of

847
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,039
in the area of

848
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,760
othello or something um but definitely

849
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,799
more complex than nine man's morals

850
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,039
but also this is just the uh

851
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,320
states-based complexity now panda game

852
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,360
is a really short game when you play a

853
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,678
two-player game

854
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,918
it's about 20 moves so all of this is

855
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,480
basically crammed into a very short time

856
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,679
so

857
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,279
this um and in this one here

858
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,720
basically the what you get here on the

859
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,520
bottom this

860
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,600
is really short so um the average

861
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,760
branching factor then

862
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,039
will be much higher so you get basically

863
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,039
doing this you can again

864
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,080
to have different assumptions i come to

865
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,000
these values

866
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,000
and you've got a lower bound upper bound

867
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,919
and something i call the best estimate

868
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and that basically means uh this

869
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,640
basically is somehow the proof that this

870
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,840
game

871
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,120
plays along in the same area as do other

872
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,480
classic board games

873
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,199
that we all love and cherish

874
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,559
so that was that that was quite

875
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,480
satisfying to see because

876
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:15,520
you know it fits into the observation

877
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,520
that this is a fun game

878
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,439
and then let me just allow one more

879
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,240
minute about the decisiveness

880
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,840
so does it always end in practice yes it

881
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,159
does

882
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,439
you basically say here the thing is when

883
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,200
you design a game

884
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,720
as soon as you start losing and you see

885
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,200
you don't have any more chance to win

886
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,440
you will try to force a draw

887
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,039
so this is a big pitfall for anyone who

888
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,880
designs a game

889
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,158
this draw thing how do you avoid a draw

890
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,640
you want to have a cool game

891
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,600
that is kind of open in the result until

892
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,279
the end

893
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,279
and then still allows somehow drama

894
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:52,159
but not a complete stalemate or the same

895
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,480
it should be the absolute exception

896
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,240
so looking at this it's like well is it

897
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,600
actually possible to block someone to

898
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,120
hinder someone from winning

899
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,879
like can i play this strategy i don't

900
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,639
want to win i just want the other guy

901
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:08,080
not to win

902
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:11,440
so and um oops oh missing a slide here

903
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,760
okay so sorry i'm missing a slide but

904
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,279
um i can just briefly verbally tell you

905
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,559
that there is a proof actually

906
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:20,480
because to be able if you are able

907
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,639
to block the other one and make it

908
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,799
impossible for the other one to win

909
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:28,399
you yourself are in a winning position

910
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,918
so this uh you know involves a little

911
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,439
bit of geometry and i can possibly put

912
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,000
that up on the table but that is

913
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,080
basically the

914
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,840
proof so again a result that i'm quite

915
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,918
happy with because it means

916
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,519
don't worry it'll always end you will

917
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,360
not get stuck in an endless loop it

918
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,519
takes like 20 or maybe 30 moves

919
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,080
but then the game will end so that's

920
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,960
good fun

921
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,600
um then one more thing while we're at

922
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,360
this kind of abstract stuff

923
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,600
remember the starting point of this

924
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,918
whole idea was that we are dealing with

925
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,399
two-dimensional structures

926
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,159
all these different board games now as

927
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,239
go players and chess players know

928
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,279
it makes a difference whether you put

929
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,000
your horse

930
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,600
your your knight at the rim of the board

931
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,240
or in the center of the board because

932
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,480
there is a rim and there is a center

933
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,440
now how is that in pentagon if you

934
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,120
really look at it

935
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,880
the way it looks like um

936
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,760
well let me see we've got it again

937
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,760
picture of pentagon

938
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,240
this one so you see here in pentagon

939
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,720
there isn't really i mean we start at

940
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,240
the outside and we move to the inside

941
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,000
we could also start on the inside and

942
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,640
move to the outside

943
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
there isn't really a rim since if i want

944
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,120
to get from this red point

945
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,919
to that red point i have to cross a long

946
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,959
line

947
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,120
a short line and another short line

948
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,559
or a short line here on the outside

949
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,320
which also just three stops

950
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,000
and a long line and a short line so

951
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,799
always like two short

952
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,240
and one long line whichever path i

953
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,000
choose

954
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,000
so this means that there isn't really a

955
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,039
rim and what you could possibly do is

956
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,880
like

957
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,640
fold this up you could take this middle

958
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,320
bit here if you want and lift it up

959
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,760
so that that ring kind of collapses like

960
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,559
a like a cloth

961
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,919
and then what you then would get is a

962
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,799
geometric shape that

963
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:21,279
is called a an antiprism

964
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,039
and the antiprism looks like this so

965
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,000
here basically you see it i would move

966
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:27,760
from the small stop

967
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,360
a to the big stop a you know long path

968
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:34,399
short path short path and i'm here or

969
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,959
i could go any of the other ways so

970
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,479
this is quite funny and interesting and

971
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,760
obviously you know sitting together and

972
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,600
discovering this we thought

973
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,039
well we must actually come up with

974
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,639
something like a three-dimensional

975
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,640
pentagram pentagon where

976
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,559
we build this out of wire and can play

977
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,279
it like three-dimensional

978
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,240
however we have similar problems to what

979
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,360
we had before

980
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,919
like what sizes of balls or of spheres

981
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,320
would

982
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,360
then be the stops so that again in these

983
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,519
points here

984
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,439
they are kind of just a jacket so this

985
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,600
is a geometrical riddle for those

986
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,279
of you those of you who like to solve

987
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,960
mathematical riddles

988
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:12,239
it's on the table who's the first to

989
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,918
solve this be welcome be my guest

990
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,879
brings us to some other aspects we got

991
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:19,759
the games we got the tournaments we got

992
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,000
we got a trophy that we compete for if

993
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,839
we

994
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,599
are allowed to all these things really

995
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:26,960
good fun we haven't

996
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,159
yet got a proper game engine that people

997
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,159
can log in

998
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,000
and i'm very thankful to nikki and to

999
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,200
kobite who are working very hard to make

1000
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,520
this possible

1001
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,040
however it seems also there that there

1002
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,839
are surprisingly

1003
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,480
um surprisingly surprising obstacles

1004
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,279
really

1005
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,520
like it starts with um if you go to got

1006
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,399
the original pentagram shape

1007
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,199
how do you how do you call the different

1008
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,719
stops

1009
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:54,799
here so it's not that easy and chess is

1010
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,879
like e2 e4 in here

1011
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,599
so because this can rotate so you have

1012
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:02,240
to find somehow something that really

1013
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,760
well good news is we got that solved but

1014
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,279
then also if you have a

1015
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,599
user interface and you want to click

1016
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,000
somewhere you've got x and y coordinates

1017
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,160
but

1018
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,079
how does that x and y coordinate

1019
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,000
transform so what's the actual

1020
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,800
coordinates of any of these stops

1021
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,960
in a cartesian coordinates so obviously

1022
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,640
you know you think oh it's circular so

1023
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,720
you got to have kind of work a little

1024
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,480
bit with complex numbers

1025
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,839
again it's solvable but it's not that

1026
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,680
trivial

1027
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,599
so it's a bit of a price and since we're

1028
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,520
here i'm talking to a lot of um

1029
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,160
people who are into this kind of stuff

1030
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,320
um we would welcome very much if uh

1031
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,200
if you want to be involved with this and

1032
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,440
maybe help us

1033
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,240
uh come to a solution so that we can

1034
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,440
finally

1035
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,759
um play this so i've got a number of

1036
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,920
links here and maybe that's worth

1037
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,480
showing this slide a little bit longer

1038
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,599
um this is where you can get the

1039
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,119
kickstarter copy

1040
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,560
but there are also these github

1041
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,240
repositories and stuff like that and

1042
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,400
plus this also my email address

1043
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,759
if you have questions regarding this if

1044
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,720
you want to be involved then

1045
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,720
please be my guest

1046
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,520
so and with this long story really i can

00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:16,160
pandemic is over

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,759
for the next panther game cup that was

1052
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,200
won by anna hitler by the way

1053
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,920
happy birthday anna also um in 2020 and

tournament and the whole social aspect

1057
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,720

1058
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:41,839
together in the coming year

1059
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:41,839
