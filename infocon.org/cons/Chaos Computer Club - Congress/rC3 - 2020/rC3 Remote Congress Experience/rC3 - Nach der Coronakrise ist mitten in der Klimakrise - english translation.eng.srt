between english and german

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,840
from last year

13
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,919
and how it was built in three days we

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,000
are in vulnerable

15
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:17,119
things just continue and then

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,080
the robert institute said

17
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,320
the danger of this thing coming to us is

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,320
low

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,000
the problem with corona is not the

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,000
mortality

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,280
we have 30 000 deaths in germany which

22
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,839
is dramatic but

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,840
alcohol and smoking are more dangerous

24
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,119
we wanted to flatten the curve and we

25
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,719
saw it in

26
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:03,040
bergamo and

27
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,559
our hospitals were overtaxed

28
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,840
and this is why we have to flatten the

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,840
curve and this only works with a

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
shutdown

31
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:17,040
so we have to pivot our whole um

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,640
social and and health system

33
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,160
and the problem with corona is we don't

34
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,640
see it

35
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,599
and i don't see being infected and i

36
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,519
don't know any

37
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,000
corona deaths and when the human can't

38
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,000
see it

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and then they don't uh observe it

40
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,679
they don't acknowledge it there's

41
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,519
plenty of small particles that um that

42
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,040
can do something

43
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,680
so now he's talking about um

44
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,400
carbon dioxide and he said if if it's

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,840
pink

46
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,840
then we would actually see it we would

47
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,319
we would feel it some carbon dioxide is

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,640
invisible and we don't really see

49
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,640
anything

50
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,000
but we can observe that carbon dioxide

51
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,400
generates

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,400
changes

53
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,080
already pivoted to the two neighboring

54
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,400
planets

55
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,400
mars

56
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,840
has more than 400 degrees because of co2

57
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,440
yeah with carbon dioxide you can

58
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,799
you can tilt a system

59
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,680
into a different state so

60
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,599
i advise those people go to venus and

61
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,280
have a look at the 400 degrees and then

62
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,000
you have some sense of what carbon

63
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,000
dioxide can do

64
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,840
so if we had

65
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,239
multiple percentages then

66
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,840
it would be impossible to live here but

67
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,840
we're here in parts per million

68
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,959
and

69
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,320
we have pushed it to something that has

70
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,320
not been seen for 300 million years

71
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,960
so this is not that much less than the

72
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:59,680
venus but we don't need 400 degrees

73
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,919
to change it to a few degrees the small

74
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,840
changes will be enough

75
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,000
and this is what we see is the

76
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,960
temperatures over the last 20 000 years

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,919
so since the last ice age

78
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,919
now on the right side we are now in a

79
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,440
warm period

80
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:21,039
the ice ice h ended about 10

81
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:24,160
000 years ago so if we look from

82
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,960
minus 20 000 to minus

83
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,639
five thousand years ago there's around

84
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,320
four degrees celsius

85
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:36,639
plus and if we look now in the

86
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:40,639
present there's this uh rapid increase

87
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:43,199
in the last hundred years this is about

88
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,400
one degree celsius equivalent to a

89
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,919
quarter of an ice

90
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:52,799
age to a warm period it's a very strong

91
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:56,960
increase in strong change fast change

92
00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:00,639
so in comparison the um

93
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,520
the progress from the ice ice ice age to

94
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,120
the one period took about 10 000 years

95
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,159
but we have done this

96
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,280
in the in the very recent past

97
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,919
so we haven't seen this for a very long

98
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,039
time

99
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,919
of history the one degree

100
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,840
plus we can see pretty easily because we

101
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,159
have

102
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,159
appeared the northern arctic area

103
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,759
lower part is canada right as

104
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,199
it's russia and we compare us from the

105
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,720
70s to

106
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,919
today and we see a radical decline

107
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,919
in sea ice

108
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:48,560
we assume that in the middle of the

109
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:51,840
century we'll have an ice-free novel

110
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,800
but we also need to have uh

111
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,000
think about what will happen when the um

112
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,199
when the land ice is

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,960
uh melting so for instance green uh

114
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,639
greenland

115
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,840
there will be a large changes

116
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,319
we also see a lot of more fires for

117
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,719
instance

118
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:16,160
australia this year and siberia

119
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,639
so areas where you don't expect

120
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,000
a lot of white fires appearing or

121
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,000
california

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,199
so due to the changes in

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,240
participation through the

124
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,280
climate change we see the drastic

125
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,160
changes

126
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,198
this is the german forest we also have

127
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,800
here

128
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:45,280
lots of differences and changes to the

129
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:48,560
precipitation and rain have

130
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,400
basically the big uh dieback of

131
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,599
foresters here in germany

132
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:57,840
and this is just due to one degree plus

133
00:07:53,599 --> 00:08:00,319
also there's a lot of dry

134
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,878
dryness here in germany so we have a

135
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,800
problem

136
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,240
of bringing up the resources for the

137
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,360
river rhine as you can see here

138
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,400
and climate change already produces

139
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,120
a lot of millions euro and euros

140
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,520
of damage to the economy and this is

141
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,319
just

142
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,159
one degree plus which from which we know

143
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,440
it's already there

144
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:28,080
and our models

145
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,840
predict as the business as usual to

146
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,958
to have an increase at the end of the

147
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:37,439
century of about four degrees celsius

148
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:39,439
so if in the in the next hundred years

149
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,399
temperatures will go up in the same way

150
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,399
they done before

151
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,839
we will have a change as if we coming

152
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:54,160
from an

153
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:56,880
ice age to a long period and um

154
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,399
for comparison in the ice age germany is

155
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,560
covered with 400 meters

156
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:05,839
ice so the planet will change

157
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:09,040
from ice time ice age to um

158
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,760
to the present warm period very rapidly

159
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,480
very much and that this will happen very

160
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,560
rapidly

161
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,160
and we are in a really big concern about

162
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,920
that

163
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,000
so what would be the worst case of um

164
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,360
sea level rise it would be about three

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,880
meters

166
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,760
and um yeah miami already has problems

167
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,160
but there will be vast areas which gonna

168
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,319
be

169
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,360
underwater so a lot of 100 million

170
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,680
persons there are people so um

171
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,640
there will be a lot of migration from

172
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,160
this areas

173
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:49,040
to the uh to other parts of the world

174
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,439
so in a moment it's not that much but

175
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,560
the

176
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,560
development will increase

177
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,360
the fasten up

178
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,519
we also see that participation

179
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,880
has changed it's not raining here

180
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,880
anymore but

181
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,920
at the other place of the earth it

182
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,160
started raining

183
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,760
much more and therefore water

184
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,279
distribution is not

185
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,439
uh not very good right now so

186
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,399
lots of areas in africa will have

187
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,440
dryness all year round

188
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,160
if there's no uh no rain then

189
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,640
we'll also have problems with food

190
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,120
product

191
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,640
food production so we've seen this in

192
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,399
germany

193
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:36,079
two years ago

194
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:39,120
it actually came to me the first time

195
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:42,719
as a real thing two years ago i'm living

196
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,560
in in the eastern of germany

197
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:50,640
and two years ago

198
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,119
people told me uh two uh people told me

199
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,000
during the german democratic republic we

200
00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:00,480
would have now a real problem

201
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,680
you know about climate change

202
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,480
because i heard in the news we had 30

203
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,599
degrees

204
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,079
30 uh reduction of food production and

205
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,640
in the german democratic republic back

206
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,839
then

207
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,839
we couldn't have managed this

208
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,399
no the climate change isn't coming it's

209
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,839
already here

210
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,800
so in comparison if we're living in the

211
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,040
middle ages

212
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,800
we would have real famine here in

213
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,519
germany right now

214
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,240
it would be one of the greatest famines

215
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,279
here in

216
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,600
europe ever but today we have the

217
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,480
possibility to just buy the crops from

218
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,720
anywhere else

219
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,160
and people are starving another part of

220
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,640
the world

221
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,000
this is another study from colleagues of

222
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,079
mine

223
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
three years ago they done this and they

224
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:53,680
calculated for the worst case

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,200
45 degree celsius plus what will happen

226
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,638
to the to the

227
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,839
area where people live so the red areas

228
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,200
in this map

229
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,519
will be that hot that people shouldn't

230
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,720
be

231
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:12,000
outside for longer periods of time or

232
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,600
during the day because they might

233
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,600
actually die

234
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,720
so and you see that these are vast

235
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,000
amounts of land

236
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,720
for instance nearly all of brazil but

237
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,160
also

238
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,959
indonesia parts of africa so about one

239
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,760
to

240
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,760
one billion people would be um

241
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,800
would have to stay in the cellar during

242
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,760
the day

243
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,800
which would also lead to a lot of

244
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,800
migration

245
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,160
we wouldn't have a situation like on

246
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,519
venus where

247
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,240
so planet won't just start burning and

248
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,480
ignite

249
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,480
but um vast areas of land would be

250
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,480
inhabitable

251
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,120
one of the biggest or even the

252
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,480
biggest ever migration of humans on the

253
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,279
planet

254
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,360
and if we if you look at what europe is

255
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,720
doing with 20 000

256
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,160
refugees in greece so we

257
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,320
we assume that it will be a catastrophe

258
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,920
when billions of people are start

259
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,040
migrating

260
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,920
and we need to be concerned that maybe a

261
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,360
civilization

262
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,479
will destroy itself due to this so

263
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,760
we have to really um act

264
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,560
now to get uh to get this under control

265
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,200
in comparison to corona climate crisis

266
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,719
is a

267
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,279
complete over our order of magnitude

268
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,199
we have to act now we're always talking

269
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,160
about the end of the century this is a

270
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,560
bit difficult

271
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,680
because if my generation is start

272
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,359
calculating

273
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:54,800
and well it's not it's not

274
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,639
um our concern but the young generation

275
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,760
which is born 2010

276
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,920
or even now in 2020

277
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,160
the young generation will have to deal

278
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,680
with this catastrophe

279
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,120
at this full extent and so therefore in

280
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,880
the last years we saw

281
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:16,079
the fridays for future movement and

282
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,720
people are telling so young people tell

283
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,560
us in

284
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,480
school there's climate change and we

285
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,599
need to do something about it but

286
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,120
in real life see that there's nothing

287
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,560
done about it

288
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:32,000
so they have been going on the street

289
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,479
because we have to act now

290
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,440
so for in comparison to the corona

291
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,279
crisis

292
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,279
where there are also tipping points

293
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,800
we saw that it might be a period of time

294
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,199
where you can manage to

295
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,880
adapt to the situation but at some

296
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,399
points there are tipping points where

297
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,279
you can't

298
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,279
so we assume this is 1.5 degrees celsius

299
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,480
plus

300
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,240
and this might be a good comparison

301
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,519
might be bergamo in italy in

302
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,399
uh in march where at the at some point

303
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,360
the system

304
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,199
just tipped and they had chaos in the

305
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,560
streets

306
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:15,760
this actually has managed to um

307
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,638
to get to the politicians and we have

308
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,560
the paris

309
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,720
agreement where we agreed on

310
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,160
reduce climate change to about two

311
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,399
degrees celsius

312
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:32,079
and possibly less and

313
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:35,680
we have hope because uh us president has

314
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:39,040
um elected ps president has announced to

315
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,040
get back into the agreement and um

316
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,719
but now we have to look and how fast we

317
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,639
need to get active

318
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,680
um when should we

319
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,240
act when we don't wanna get over 1.5

320
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,359
degrees

321
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,680
we'll have just less than 400 gigatons

322
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,360
of cn2s

323
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,920
and in perspective we already emitted 2

324
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,600
300 trigger tones so what's the rest

325
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,519
budget

326
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,240
it's not that much anymore

327
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,720
so if the co2 emissions go down linearly

328
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,639
until

329
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:18,560
then 2040. then they must be at zero

330
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,880
um in order to not uh pass this boundary

331
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,040
and we see this doesn't look good this

332
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,040
is

333
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,480
faster than this at the moment at the

334
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,959
moment this is going down through

335
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,959
corona

336
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:05,839
but we expect that uh it'll go up again

337
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,839
after

338
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,799
there's no ambition from our politicians

339
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,480
to

340
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,480
accelerate this decrease

341
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,240
for the first few years are part of the

342
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,839
reunification of germany because um

343
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,319
the eastern industry has broken down

344
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:33,840
and then we've only had a decrease after

345
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,840
2000 and that's

346
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,760
so our plan is 40 through 2020

347
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,400
and unfortunately we will meet this one

348
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,320
this uh

349
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,919
takes the pressure off the government

350
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:01,439
but we expect that it'll go up again

351
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:04,880
the targets are not enough

352
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,039
if we really wanted to achieve our goals

353
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,240
then we would have

354
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,919
been down into that green zone

355
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,679
so with what we're currently committed

356
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,559
to we're going for

357
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,559
two degrees celsius

358
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,678
with our targets we cannot comply with

359
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,840
the

360
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,840
paris accord

361
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,480
production and the next 10 15 minutes i

362
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,840
would like to

363
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,960
describe this so here you see the

364
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,959
energy consumption

365
00:18:52,799 --> 00:19:00,720
here you see the various renewables

366
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,720
biomass watercraft windcraft

367
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:11,840
voltaics doesn't look so bad

368
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,799
so here's the same diagram again but um

369
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,960
because we have other areas as well

370
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:38,240
so we have um heating

371
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,240
we have travel here

372
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
together

373
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,559
within 20 years to 100 renewables

374
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,320
i'm working here in engineering sciences

375
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,840
this is what it looks like many people

376
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,280
so whether we use those or not um

377
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,960
doesn't really make it

378
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,960
any difference we need

379
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,039
if you if you exchange your gas heater

380
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,399
with a

381
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:08,640
heat pump then you

382
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:14,240
then you will have lots of um

383
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,240
new energy reduction of fossil energy

384
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,790
if you think about it we don't even have

385
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,280
gas but uh german government is not

386
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:27,840
[Music]

387
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,559
doing this is not enforcing this now

388
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,158
example

389
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:34,158
traffic we need to have a different um

390
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,760
different behavior with regards to

391
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,200
traffic so people

392
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:42,000
uh germany has about 80 million um

393
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,200
inhabitants if we would translate this

394
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,960
to the whole world

395
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:50,480
we wouldn't need to build 30

396
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:54,240
billion 30 million more cars

397
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,720
so if we should if you would

398
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,720
like to

399
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,480
to bring our behavior to the whole world

400
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:06,240
we need to have a completely different

401
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:09,120
way of using traffic so

402
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,520
traffic is a much more difficult problem

403
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,639
when

404
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,918
um when heating because uh we are using

405
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,480
fossil fuels and

406
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,240
uh using them with just an efficiency of

407
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,640
20 to 30

408
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,640
percent

409
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:42,239
public transportation with trams

410
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,799
but if you want to have

411
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,840
private transportation it needs to be

412
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,039
electric because

413
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:52,240
electric cars have a um have an

414
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:55,360
energy efficiency of a factor free above

415
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,480
fossil fuels so we need to reduce the

416
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,799
energy consumption

417
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:04,000
this energy so here we see a typical

418
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:07,120
combustion engine will need about six

419
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
liters of petrol

420
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,719
and they'll get with one kilowatt hour

421
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,520
about 1.8

422
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,960
kilometers so we have the problem that

423
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,760
hydrogen is a bit

424
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:25,200
inefficient in um in production

425
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,360
and electric car would be a

426
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,480
bit more efficient than the combustion

427
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,000
engine

428
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:35,600
so on and all over um including

429
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,600
the production costs uh hydrogen car

430
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,840
won't get further than a combustion

431
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,840
engine conventional combustion engine

432
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,678
but if we would have a battery powered

433
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,320
electrical car

434
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,880
we wouldn't have that much of loss due

435
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,200
to the

436
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,039
hydrogen production and we would get two

437
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,679
and a half times the

438
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,600
the range from the um hydrogen car and

439
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,559
that's the key

440
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,959
so we need to get down with our energy

441
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:04,399
consumption and we can this done

442
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:08,960
by um by

443
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:12,000
forbidding fossil heating and

444
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,799
using electric cars if you don't use

445
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,240
this

446
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:19,760
few points very efficiently we could

447
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,320
reach the um reach our goal of the paris

448
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,440
agreement

449
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,158
actually if we enforce it now

450
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,960
and then the rest would have to be

451
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,880
covered

452
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:34,159
climate neutral this is the pathway

453
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:37,440
german government is enforcing right now

454
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:40,320
and we

455
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,279
plan about increasing renewable energies

456
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,120
a little bit

457
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:47,360
and doing this mainly by wind energy

458
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,399
and this is the current planning which

459
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,678
is not

460
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,600
nearly enough so there

461
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,039
you see there is no vision the

462
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,439
government brings here

463
00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:02,799
to increase the energy change in germany

464
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,440
to renewables there is you have to admit

465
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,840
this

466
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,120
so there's a big question mark because

467
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,240
we have no plan how to reduce the energy

468
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,239
consumption right now

469
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,120
so we see we have

470
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:22,879
about a quarter of the speed we need to

471
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,479
get um our economy to climate neutrality

472
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,279
right now so okay

473
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,919
what can you do us you could uh you

474
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:32,159
could

475
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:34,400
use a solar thermic energy for heating

476
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,240
but this is not that much we can do with

477
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,120
this we could use

478
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,039
water power this year is norway but we

479
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,320
don't have this kind of environment here

480
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,080
in germany a little bit in southern

481
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,200
germany but that's not enough

482
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,279
so the really really most important

483
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,200
energy forms you can use in germany is

484
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,200
wind and solar and we have to increase

485
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,440
renewable energies then we would have to

486
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,320
use have an increase of three gigawatt

487
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,520
hours

488
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,200
per year on show offshore and seven

489
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:21,279
gigawatt

490
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:23,520
gigawatts per year uh onshore

491
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,360
the first thing we can do is to do this

492
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,840
offshore

493
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,760
people say if there's not going to

494
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,559
happen in the northern city we do it on

495
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,279
the east

496
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,879
in the baltic sea but this is baltic sea

497
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,840
it's much smaller

498
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,559
first thing we need to act on is using

499
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,399
all the places in our northern cv camp

500
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:47,440
so we need to reach about 8 000

501
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,000
wind mills in the northern sea and then

502
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,799
we need

503
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,799
to have a bit much much more onshore

504
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:05,600
we need to have about 70 um

505
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:08,880
67 000 wind windmills onshore

506
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:12,879
this would be nice we see it right

507
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:17,039
we see it right now the development

508
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:20,559
and the reds are new windmills

509
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,360
uh yellow these are repowering old

510
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,559
windmills

511
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:30,479
and blue is what we actually install

512
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:33,520
near offshore before

513
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,279
showed what we need and this is what

514
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,279
uh what is happening due to new

515
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,399
regulations a few years ago

516
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:45,520
so uh new windmills basically

517
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:48,399
aren't uh constructed anymore

518
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,879
uh changed a bit of the legislation but

519
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,239
this

520
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,760
wouldn't be nearly enough yeah so

521
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,399
and still we see if we build

522
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,200
a lot of lot of windmills all we can

523
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,918
then there is

524
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,760
still a gap in the energy production and

525
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:08,559
therefore we'll need solar energy

526
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,840
solar energy we need 18 gigawatts more

527
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,200
per year

528
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:16,959
and right now we built about four

529
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:19,760
gigawatts more this year last year

530
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,039
so we need to have a significant amount

531
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,240
in percentage

532
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:27,840
of our land area and if we

533
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:31,440
look for for example berlin berlin not

534
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,000
is not even using one percent of a roof

535
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,480
area

536
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,159
for solar energy that has to happen a

537
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,039
lot and

538
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,000
there needs to change a lot and also we

539
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,520
need to go on

540
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,520
the um on the farmland

541
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,720
because there is a lot of space for

542
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:55,840
photovoltaic panels for instance

543
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:55,840
in this way which can be used

544
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,959
[Music]

545
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,279
so we have about 180 000 square

546
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:08,399
kilometers of

547
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:10,720
uh agra area so

548
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,840
people say without solar panels they

549
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,840
were nicer but

550
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:19,520
uh we have to die and any death anyway

551
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:22,559
so what we also need is uh storage

552
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,200
because if there solar sun and there's

553
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,559
no wind

554
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,799
then we still need energy so

555
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:33,840
i think we will have

556
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:37,200
decentralized battery storages

557
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,639
for instance for cars

558
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:44,480
and for a longer periods of time

559
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:47,679
for instance what we have produced

560
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,080
in summer with sun energy we would

561
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,679
use something like power to gas where we

562
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,039
use water and

563
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:58,480
co2 to produce methane gas

564
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:01,919
methanol a methane gas and store

565
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,399
this in conventional storage facilities

566
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,919
using them in the winter to produce

567
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:10,000
electricity and

568
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,960
heat we calculated this also from an

569
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,080
economic

570
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,200
point of view and this is possible and

571
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,678
this for example

572
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,640
is the biggest energy storage place in

573
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:23,039
germany

574
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:26,399
it's the gas storage facility reading

575
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:30,240
the gas is stored under under the earth

576
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:33,760
and we can store the 4.4

577
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,320
billion cubic meters of gas

578
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,120
we have we have dozens of them so the

579
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,480
problem of

580
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:44,320
uh storage is is already solved

581
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:48,399
and and so switch to renewable energies

582
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:51,439
the economic feasible it's not that

583
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:53,120
expensive if it used the amount of money

584
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,240
we used for corona

585
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,439
then germany would be climber neutral

586
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,840
overnight

587
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,360
germany can do this actually for a

588
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,840
crisis like corona but

589
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,799
it seems strange that it's not doing

590
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,840
this

591
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:10,720
for energy change

592
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,918
which means we need a radical new policy

593
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,039
on climate change

594
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,799
and then we also but we also need to

595
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,600
change personally

596
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,200
and the big problem is that it hasn't

597
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,158
reached the people

598
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:29,840
how how difficult and how catastrophic

599
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,840
the climate crisis

600
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,000
there's a survey on what people think

601
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,399
can reduce

602
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,120
to uh have their uh have their carbon

603
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,080
footprint

604
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,559
to reduce a lot of people think they

605
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:46,000
wouldn't use

606
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,918
plastic bags but in fact this is not

607
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,320
something where you really reduce your

608
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,519
carbon footprint a lot

609
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,879
but um it's just for three kilograms of

610
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,919
co2 per year

611
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:01,440
but we produce 10 000 kilograms of

612
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:04,640
per person per year so for instance

613
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:08,000
we could do two beef steaks per week

614
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:11,600
which germans are using

615
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,720
consuming would be 300 kilograms of co2

616
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,799
per year

617
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,760
so we have to go for the meat

618
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,000
consumption

619
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,320
because just the meat con meat

620
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,679
production produces 10 percent of

621
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,840
the co2 and contributes to climate

622
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,840
change

623
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,559
also one uh one air travel

624
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,360
that produces four tons of co2 and these

625
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,360
are the big fish

626
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,840
okay sure we see with corona

627
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,039
we can do with dig with digital

628
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:49,199
technology a lot of without travel

629
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:52,480
driving cars per person is 1.5

630
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,799
tons co2 per per year

631
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,519
which is three times as much as people

632
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,519
in bangladesh

633
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,519
also german german home produces about

634
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,840
four times that much of co2 as

635
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,840
uh people in india

636
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:15,439
an energy car you would also reduce your

637
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,279
emissions by one ton per year a

638
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,679
photovoltaic

639
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,119
installation would uh would be

640
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,280
sufficient

641
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,839
and you don't need your own home you can

642
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,280
use your balcony

643
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:31,599
so actually there are ways we can do it

644
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,320
if we want to

645
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,119
really important is that the government

646
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,800
is making the policies we need

647
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:43,839
because people actually need to be

648
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,399
forced to the solution sometimes so we

649
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,799
need

650
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,879
the politicians next year here in

651
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,839
germany there will be general elections

652
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,239
and it's important that it would be a

653
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,599
big

654
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:58,720
point in the election decision how is

655
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,720
that stand to climate change

656
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,000
i think a good example for how we can

657
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,440
manage to do big things is um john f

658
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,800
kennedy said

659
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:15,040
we chose to go to the moon in 1962.

660
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,040
give an example this time we used a

661
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,920
punch card computers

662
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,480
so this was a really really big

663
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,160
challenge

664
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,760
back then because you have to hit the

665
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,960
moon people said

666
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,599
this will cost money it's really

667
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,320
really difficult but people's government

668
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,760
said

669
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:36,400
yes we pay this we do this and um

670
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,720
we pay what has has to be paid to reach

671
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,720
the moon

672
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,839
the us alone paid um three billion

673
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,839
dollars to reach the moon

674
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,880
if we would do the same for the future

675
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,680
of our

676
00:35:52,880 --> 00:36:00,800
of our species of humans then we

677
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,919
we have a solution we should uh

678
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:07,119
we should make climate change to our new

679
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:10,560
man on the moon challenge

680
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,880
we shouldn't wait now we have to act

681
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,359
so with this thanks for your attention

682
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,400
here are a few links

683
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:21,598
where you can see all this uh

684
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,160
compact information i give you in a bit

685
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,320
more extensive way for instance on my

686
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,480
website on my youtube channel

687
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:32,720
and uh from three years from

688
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,560
for three months now there's a podcast

689
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,680
from uh with me

690
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,160
so thanks for your attention and um i

691
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,279
hope

692
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,839
that there's a bit of time to discuss

693
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,839
this topic

694
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:57,118
this was a lot of information

695
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,440
so if this is actually so important why

696
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,440
isn't it

697
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:06,240
so we see there are two points

698
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,560
um for instance there is the uh thing

699
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,799
like

700
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,078
with corona the people who think it's

701
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,880
all uh

702
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:16,000
all crazy and lies they're also the

703
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:19,359
people who deny climate change

704
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,040
and um this is this is a problem

705
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,359
for instance with the rfd here in

706
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,400
germany

707
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:30,720
if you tell the people you don't have to

708
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:33,119
uh to decrease your consumption

709
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,720
then people will vote for them and so

710
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,640
the big parties like cdu spd

711
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,879
people will actually vote for these

712
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,879
people

713
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,560
so and therefore you see that in terms

714
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,760
of renewable energies

715
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,078
cdu campaigns are pretty much the same

716
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,200
as

717
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,599
uh with rfd of deep campaign

718
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,240
so right populists here in germany but

719
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,839
also

720
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,839
familiar with it so

721
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,320
what can so people are asking how to use

722
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,359
combustion engines

723
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,680
with climate change no there is no way

724
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,680
for this

725
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:16,799
so also for uh for the car manufacturers

726
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,799
this is a problem because

727
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,839
um

728
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,920
a few years ago this was a good thing

729
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,920
because it's

730
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,959
brought them a bit a step forward and

731
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,880
they now have electric cars

732
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:42,079
but also there is the things like um

733
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:45,920
energy uh companies

734
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,359
and uh energy companies have long

735
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,400
running contracts

736
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,598
to use fossil fuels and if they break

737
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,880
these contracts then

738
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,880
it's a problem for them

739
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,040
and of course it's also nice to travel

740
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,440
by airplane to

741
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,440
holiday

742
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,680
last year 2019.

743
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,000
we're traveling by an airplane 97

744
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,040
but if in germany we say that um flying

745
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,160
away and

746
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:26,160
into holiday is not an option anymore

747
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:29,279
then that is a threat to

748
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:32,078
the elections still

749
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,079
okay i understand

750
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,079
the political aspect

751
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,839
you mentioned briefly nuclear energy

752
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,640
it's clean when we don't have a problem

753
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,960
but we've seen that

754
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,960
problems

755
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,469
[Music]

756
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:14,319
but you still have an incredibly long

757
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,760
legacy let's

758
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:20,560
ignore the risk let's just say

759
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,520
let's say we we manage the risk and the

760
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,400
long term

761
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,160
but everything is against it anyway

762
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:39,839
nuclear energy

763
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:39,839
covers three to four percent size

764
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:53,839
we would have to build hundreds of new

765
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,839
nuclear facilities in europe

766
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,960
it

767
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:40,240
then we'll use up all the uranium

768
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,240
and then we have to look for other stuff

769
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:49,839
we have to start hoping for fusion which

770
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:49,839
we will never know where that works

771
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,359
keep them running and then i can

772
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,359
continue to fly to my vacations

773
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,440
of society so that people might get an

774
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,440
awareness

775
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,800
the last year has helped a lot to create

776
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:31,839
awareness

777
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,839
we've been doing it longer for the last

778
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,839
20 years

779
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,040
two or three years ago we said that

780
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,919
we say go left and then the government

781
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,920
goes to all right

782
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,839
2018

783
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,839
is

784
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,400
there's a lot happening for instance in

785
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,520
australia australia is the biggest

786
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,760
export of coal but

787
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,040
due to the big wildfires there's a

788
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,079
change of mind

789
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:03,440
also in other countries there is

790
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:06,800
moves to um to act on climate change

791
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,800
so but we are also

792
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,160
because um also we in the climate

793
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,000
movement

794
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:17,920
we produce co2 and lots of co2

795
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,800
and may i shortly interrupt we have a

796
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,800
lot of questions here

797
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,119
just a little bit because this is very

798
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,119
interesting

799
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,520
and there are lots of questions

800
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:33,440
questions uh we would like to

801
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:36,720
over overdue our time

802
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,720
so just a few sentences

803
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,800
me if is that the technology can we do

804
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,000
can we do it i would say

805
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,400
yes second question can we pay for it

806
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,680
and if i look on corona i would say yes

807
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,200
definitely

808
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:06,399
so we can say two times yes and

809
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,118
if you ask are we ready for it i'd sadly

810
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,680
say no

811
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,880
but this is a psychological problem and

812
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,680
a political problem but

813
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,920
if he can solve this if he can solve

814
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,040
this

815
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,760
i don't know but um

816
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,520
for instance if there is a asteroid on

817
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,960
collision course to earth

818
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:28,400
we wouldn't say no there is no solution

819
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:32,319
we would say yeah we can find a solution

820
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,720
so i interrupt again

821
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:37,040
technical questions how is it about

822
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:40,240
sustainability of solar

823
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:43,599
solar energy panels

824
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,359
so how long are they um how long can

825
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,800
they be used or

826
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:50,960
how what's about uh recycling of them so

827
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,920
yes of course every technology has a

828
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,480
footprint

829
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,280
and also renewable energies has a have a

830
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,400
renewable

831
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:00,240
footprint this is not zeros but it's uh

832
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,920
ten times smaller than fossil fuels and

833
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,479
conventional energy

834
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,440
and you have to think about this you

835
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:11,599
have to try to get it under control

836
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:15,040
silicon is a is a resource also

837
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:16,319
our materials are really resources for

838
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,079
instance for wind energy

839
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:24,800
copper and steel

840
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:28,079
the rotors are from cfk they

841
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,760
have recycling problems you also can of

842
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,960
course can recycle the

843
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,839
the steel from the tower so

844
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,440
if you compare it cars can't be recycled

845
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:43,839
fully

846
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,839
so this is a problem

847
00:46:55,119 --> 00:47:00,400
and resources what's about the batteries

848
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,800
what's about the lifetime

849
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,319
um what's about their recyclings are

850
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,200
there provinces being made

851
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:09,040
yes definitely in terms of batteries we

852
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:13,200
are in the stone age

853
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:15,279
stone age so you could for instance use

854
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,480
solid state batteries which have

855
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,440
factor of 10 better energy efficiency

856
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,640
and in 10 years i think about today's

857
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,000
battery technology

858
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:28,400
would just love and

859
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,520
i think the prices will go down but

860
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,440
batteries will

861
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:36,240
become better and uh because of this

862
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,520
i think we will see a dynamic

863
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,078
development

864
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,119
and it is a good thing that we discussed

865
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,400
this

866
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:47,599
in comparison to the combustion engine

867
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:51,040
you can relativize

868
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:54,319
this but for instance there are

869
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:57,359
cobalt-free batteries in the development

870
00:47:54,319 --> 00:48:00,160
so we'll have a lot of progress

871
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,119
another topic which wasn't uh discussed

872
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,040
so far

873
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:08,319
what about geothermal energy

874
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:11,440
yes right geothermal energy is really

875
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:13,920
interesting for instance eastland or um

876
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,160
turkey but here in germany the

877
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,960
geothermal energy is very very deep in

878
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,240
the earth

879
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,839
we have to deep we have to dig for three

880
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,759
to four kilometers

881
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:26,078
and one kilometer costs about a million

882
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,119
euros so this is very expensive so

883
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,760
therefore

884
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,400
uh geothermal energy can be used in

885
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,800
germany

886
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,000
but uh it's much more expensive than the

887
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,319
other forms of renewable

888
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,160
energies but you can use it for instance

889
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:41,520
in the rhine area

890
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,960
in bavaria but a lot of places in

891
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:48,160
germany it's not

892
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:52,079
not a good idea not feasible

893
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:55,520
how about co2 emissions you spoke about

894
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:57,680
um is the reduction real or is it just

895
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,240
that we exported our footprint to a

896
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:03,359
chimera for example

897
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:06,558
yes in parts

898
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:07,279
for instance if we close steel steel

899
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,440
production

900
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,319
uh plenty in germany and export it to

901
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,000
china then

902
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:14,558
our emissions go down and there's a

903
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,440
small

904
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,640
part in the reduction from this but

905
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,160
there are no real

906
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,160
numbers on this on that

907
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:28,479
i think that the decrease in emission

908
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:29,520
is actually real because we see their

909
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,720
power

910
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:36,960
coal plants which are turned off

911
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,959
and yes energy change

912
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:43,839
cause decrease in emissions but

913
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,919
also other factors play in but these

914
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:48,480
factors are just the smaller

915
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,480
smaller part

916
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:57,119
another question what's uh black

917
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:58,879
roads due to the um to the absorption of

918
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:02,000
energy from sunlight

919
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:06,079
on earth yeah of course

920
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,960
if i also was doing this on solar models

921
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:10,960
yes if you build solar modules it

922
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,359
depends on where you build them

923
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,119
if you put them on a roof then there are

924
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:18,000
black

925
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,480
then the roof already is black so it's

926
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,480
already

927
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,680
already absorbs a lot of energy so there

928
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,400
won't be a difference

929
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,240
but if you put them for instance in the

930
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,280
sand desert then it's

931
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,598
becoming a bit darker obviously

932
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,319
parts of that energy is absorbed is also

933
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,599
converted

934
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:43,119
to electrical energy so yes there's an

935
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:44,720
impact on the um on the balance of the

936
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:48,160
energy balance of the earth

937
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:50,558
but uh it's it's small so but

938
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,520
if you for instance look at germany uh

939
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,720
13

940
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:57,759
of uh lands uh land area is um

941
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:01,439
is human-made

942
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:05,280
so um in comparison to

943
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:08,160
our other infrastructure impact from

944
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,200
renewable energies on the energy balance

945
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,839
would be

946
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,839
neglectable

947
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,680
you know so what what about solar

948
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,960
roadways

949
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:25,200
yes they tried this

950
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,559
but i don't know if it's a good idea

951
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:31,200
because there is oppression

952
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:31,200
from the tires on the street and um

953
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:38,000
yes it's it's very

954
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:40,240
very difficult to do and it needs to

955
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,720
resist heavy loads so don't think that's

956
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:46,799
a real solution

957
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:51,839
so how about recycling of solar modules

958
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,839
so a counter argument would be um

959
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,960
it can't be recycled so um yes

960
00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:01,200
solar modules can actually be recycled

961
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,839
they are milled down to very

962
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,799
small parts and then the essential

963
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:09,119
resources

964
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:12,559
like a silicon aluminium silver can be

965
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:18,000
recovered some parts

966
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:22,480
can't be recovered like like plastics

967
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,480
but the rest is really good in recycling

968
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:36,000
how can you prevent uh politicians from

969
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:38,040
uh pushing the solution to the future

970
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,920
like 2030 2040

971
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:44,558
2050 what can we actually do

972
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,160
yeah therefore actually fridays for

973
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:49,280
future help a lot

974
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:52,640
um so govern the government set the

975
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:55,920
deadline to 2030 2030 is not that

976
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:58,960
much away so it's about 10 years so we

977
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:02,480
actually will see very fast

978
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:05,520
if we are actually on track so still

979
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:08,880
germany needs to improve policies but

980
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:11,280
um actually we will see fast what's

981
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,280
happening

982
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,359
this pushing to the future won't be

983
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,680
working anymore for instance also for

984
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:23,520
the european union there's legislation

985
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,160
um which says 2030 we need to be climate

986
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,480
neutral

987
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,078
and now we have to ask the question

988
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:31,760
what's happening very

989
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,760
very frequently so

990
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,480
for instance just go to your member of

991
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,520
parliament

992
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:42,960
yes for instance go to your local

993
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:45,520
local member of parliaments ask them

994
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,480
if you want to have my vote next year

995
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,599
what are you doing

996
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:51,680
on climate change how do you

997
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,200
how do you want to achieve the european

998
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,919
union's goals

999
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,359
for climate change in 2030 of course

1000
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:01,280
then a lot of times

1001
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:01,279
you'll get a lot of warm words

1002
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:11,759
just ask so from now we have

1003
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,279
three quarters of a year to the general

1004
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:17,040
election in germany

1005
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:19,680
um we need to be um

1006
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:22,640
we need to ask them and push them so

1007
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:25,839
thank you for your talk

1008
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:28,379
thanks for the invitation and have a lot

1009
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:33,308
of fun for the rest of the

1010
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:33,309
[Music]

1011
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:39,839
conference

1012
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:53,839
wow

1013
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,920
bye
