6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,399
and we're really curious already

7
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,920
yeah but i do have these questions from

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,919
them earlier

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,680
you can watch youtube yeah

10
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,840
um

11
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,919
there was a line of grannies

12
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,799
and something in boris that made

13
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,238
everyone understand

14
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:23,840
he tried to translate it but it was all

15
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:23,840
tangled up with some baba yogurt

16
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,400
police had developed a keen instinct for

17
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,360
staying one one

18
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,360
jump ahead of pr purges yeah

19
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,159
at their own columns

20
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,239
even adorable pixies like christina at

21
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,040
the end

22
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,040
of 200 words

23
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,840
and i read this one 500

24
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,840
is

25
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,959
could

26
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
oh

27
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,240
rather than facing google's notoriously

28
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,240
vicious lawyers

29
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:11,840
and trust no one which meant they had to

30
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:11,840
do it for themselves

31
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,940
[Music]

32
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,840
is

33
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
is

34
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,840
for you to help her with that synthetic

35
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,840
weapons of hackerdam

36
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
um

37
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,880
it won't look like it came from us it'll

38
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:23,919
look like exactly five times

39
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:31,840
on their wheels

40
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:31,840
how do you behave kind of hard

41
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,840
and um

42
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,360
i waited now

43
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,360
disturbed

44
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,479
it would have gone faster if i could

45
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,000
have read the cyrillic characters but i

46
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,000
had to rely on christina for that

47
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,679
not so many wouldn't be able to digest

48
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,679
them

49
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,039
i composed an email to him in english

50
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,039
yeah this wasn't as weird as this

51
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,600
just a pigeon they all used to kind of

52
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,839
pitch in english among themselves

53
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,839
with generations

54
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:09,839
i grabbed a couple thousand emails from

55
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,839
the mid-level bureaucrat i was born

56
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,839
mainly though i used it for my own

57
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,839
nicholas van dyke

58
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,640
friction that would make him a

59
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,239
believable rat i can't write it up

60
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,240
giving nicholas some thinly veiled

61
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,399
grievances about how much his enemies

62
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,399
were

63
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
treachery

64
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,839
is

65
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
because

66
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,680
in getting the details right also so i

67
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,680
had a script that did it for me

68
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,439
well there we go

69
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,480
completely like when i chose the reading

70
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,480
i wasn't thinking about that

71
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,720
now you're writing about it yeah yeah

72
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,839
that's why i write all my trips to

73
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,839
hacker cons to describe

74
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,399
immediately struck me during the

75
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,200
anonymous presentation was um

76
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,800
if if you were like a fanfic writer who

77
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,120
wanted to find all the ways that your

78
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,880
harry potter story was not quite like a

79
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,160
jk rowling harry potter story you could

80
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,120
then tweak

81
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,800
your story to rolling a fight uh using

82
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,519
anonymous right using this this

83
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,439
uh uh plagiarism detector that is you

84
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,440
know adversarial stylometry tool

85
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,040
yeah that's a detail just wanted to make

86
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,959
it seem like

87
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,839
transphobic stuff so that would that

88
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,839
would be the clincher

89
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,320
a pretty interesting discussion after

90
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,760
that um because uh

91
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,880
there are lots of of of authors and um

92
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,880
actually publishers

93
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,569
[Music]

94
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,199
and it is really far from doing that

95
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,479
i don't know i won't say that it's

96
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,839
really far from automating sometimes

97
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,399
obviously it automatically

98
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:21,519
thinks it does yes

99
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,519
the state of gpt3

100
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,839
uh

101
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,239
as a result of all of the internet

102
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,199
trolls being replaced

103
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,600
yeah i'm totally with you um at that

104
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,639
point

105
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,680
because um there will always be

106
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:45,839
um yeah the love for human generated

107
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:45,839
texts for for the art after

108
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,839
other things

109
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
um

110
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,839
um we can't use anti-monopoly

111
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
is

112
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,840
an exemption

113
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,840
i think

114
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,000
led moments uh when they balance out you

115
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,480
know the

116
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,480
monopoly

117
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,360
you would get the kind of forbearance

118
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,480
you got safe from ibm

119
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,799
when they they maybe uh jennings when he

120
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,799
was making

121
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,320
phoenix you would then see things like

122
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,320
investments

123
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,360
market believers

124
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,840
uh

125
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,509
[Music]

126
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
um

127
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,039
um okay

128
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,840
um interoperability components where

129
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,840
they say you know

130
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,840
um

131
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
foreign

132
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,400
copyrights terms of service trade

133
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,720
secrecy non-compete

134
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,039
uh you have an absolute defense and

135
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,039
obviously

136
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,600
legislatively like you could imagine

137
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,439
maybe we say then via facebook's

138
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,799
facebook

139
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,840
that's the remedy for its unlawful and

140
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,840
deceptive mergers

141
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:45,840
saying they won't punish people

142
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,039
and we can't you know we can't be

143
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,158
dependent on you guys deciding that you

144
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,039
don't want to lock that app

145
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,039
out and so

146
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:44,960
section interoperability mandates

147
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,840
through regulation that are slow moving

148
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,840
but not a slow movement

149
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,039
depend on both the lawsuits and

150
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,840
technology companies

151
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,840
software

152
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
so

153
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,840
is

154
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,840
over the last decade

155
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
uh

156
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:50,799
as i just said markets and ecosystems

157
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,240
um there was another uh pretty

158
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,120
interesting question about

159
00:24:52,240 --> 00:25:01,840
um by the way interoperability um free

160
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,840
and open yes

161
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
um

162
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,840
account i'm actually trying to stand up

163
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,840
a massage right now

164
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
um

165
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,679
it's interoperability um and

166
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,919
specifically

167
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,720
it's it's both the lack of a

168
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,720
standardized

169
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,320
profitable means of these services

170
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,080
twitter is actually trying to do

171
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,120
something about twitter's project blue

172
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,199
sky

173
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,479
i think they have like they've sat down

174
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,240
and they've gone like well

175
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,400
having a yeah that's absolute control

176
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,159
