12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,199
uh always close to my heart because with

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,759
milliwaves we

14
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,200
uh always have a stand trying to

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,720
motivate people to send

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,799
mail to jail this doesn't work properly

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,759
this time with the virtual conference so

18
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:19,280

ryan and barrett are giving

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,320
you an idea why it is important to

25
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,079
support people that are sitting in jail

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,798
and why

27
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,158
white is so valuable in jail to get all

28
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:55,680
of those mails

29
00:01:42,159 --> 00:02:09,840
with this we have some slides

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:09,840
legs don't work

31
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:26,160
did you see my flats yes

32
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,160
so squidget

33
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,480
hello

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,920
so this is going to be a real quick talk

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,000
about sending mail

36
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,640
to prisoners um sending mail to

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,480
prisoners is one of the easiest and most

38
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,958
concrete ways that you can support

39
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,480
people

40
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,440
who are in prison um one of the biggest

41
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,840
reasons that you

42
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,599
want to send mail to people in prison is

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,040
that there's a lot of down time

44
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,280
in prison um sending mail is

45
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,560
uh one of the ways that you can fill

46
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,840
that time

47
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,840
in prison

48
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,560
prison

49
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,840
not forgotten um

50
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,679
keeps and uh studies have actually shown

51
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,879
that people who are better connected to

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,560
those on the outside

53
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,518
have a better outcome once they are

54
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,000
released

55
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,680
um this is a really great way to just

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,040
keep people connected

57
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,319
um it also uh

58
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,400
does a really great job of just

59
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,839
letting people know what's going on in

60
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,599
the outside world

61
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,799
um a lot of times

62
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,200
news is kind of hard to come by uh when

63
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,959
you're

64
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,159
in prison um things like

65
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,599
magazines and newspapers and just

66
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:05,280
news in general can sometimes be really

67
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,119
hard to come by when you're in prison

68
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,720
so when you write somebody when you tell

69
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,040
them about things that are going on

70
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,159
in the outside world that's really

71
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,599
important

72
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,238
to them um so uh

73
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,719
sending mail again that's one more

74
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,798
reason

75
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,560
why it's just really important and

76
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:26,840
really good to send mail

77
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:30,800
to prisoners now um prisons often

78
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:34,239
have really really niche rules

79
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,160
about how you send mail um there

80
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,600
are general rules that you do want to

81
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,639
follow the first thing

82
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,560
don't talk about anything illegal

83
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,520
you don't want to say anything that you

84
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,560
don't that you're not going to say

85
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,599
in front of the judge a jury police or

86
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,199
prosecutors obviously all mail that is

87
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,479
sent to prisons

88
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,199
is screened it's screened in the

89
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,599
mail room before it is given to the

90
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,199
prisoner that you are sending it to

91
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,840
so obviously be smart don't talk about

92
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:12,720
um anything illegal that you do

93
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,440
um and in that same vein

94
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,479
uh some prisoners also have specific

95
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,280
topics that

96
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,199
they can and can't talk about um

97
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,119
sometimes a prisoner can't talk about

98
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,000
things related to their case they can't

99
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,600
talk about things

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,039
that um if they're a part of a group

101
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,120
case uh some prisoners can't talk about

102
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,759
uh their co-defendants and things like

103
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,440
that so you really do want to check

104
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,000
um what they can and can't talk about

105
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,039
because even if they're not talking

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,120
about it if you send something to them

107
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,719
that is prohibited they can get in

108
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,199
trouble for it

109
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,039
the other thing that you want to do is

110
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,600
as the slide says

111
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,120
include a return address in the body of

112
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,240
your letter as well as

113
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:04,000
on the on as well as on the

114
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,199
envelope um some prisons will not accept

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,120
letters if there is not a return address

116
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,360
on the envelope itself but if you want

117
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,039
an

118
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,800
answer back you're going to want to

119
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,759
include a return dress

120
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,120
on the letter as well because sometimes

121
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,319
envelopes just don't

122
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,680
get to the person you're writing to so

123
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,720
just somewhere on the letter you're

124
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,840
going to want to include

125
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,880
your return dress um

126
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,318
the other thing don't include anything

127
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,039
in your letter unless otherwise directed

128
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,720
that means

129
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:42,240
no blank paper no stamps uh

130
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,319
no money of any kind um

131
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,919
in a lot of places especially in the

132
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,840
federal system these are

133
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:52,159
not allowed um

134
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,880
there are ways that you can help

135
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,240
prisoners

136
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,280
obtain these things mostly by putting

137
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,680
money

138
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,960
into their commissary accounts they do

139
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,880
have to buy these things

140
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,919
separately at com.com

141
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,919
sorry in some places you are

142
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:14,479
not i'm sorry in some places

143
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,039
you can include these things but most

144
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,280
places

145
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,240
especially in the federal system you are

146
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,080
not allowed

147
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,440
to include these things they will not

148
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,639
reach the prisoner

149
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,759
so don't send them and finally you're

150
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,960
going to want to be very

151
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:32,479
patient when waiting for a return

152
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,120
letter uh sometimes mail gets

153
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,318
held sometimes prisoners just don't have

154
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,919
the money

155
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:43,840
to buy things like paper

156
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,758
stamps pens envelopes things like that

157
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,440
they just don't have the resources to

158
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,639
buy these things

159
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,360
from the co the com

160
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,080
com sorry so you're just gonna want to

161
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,080
be patient

162
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,280
and don't get mad if a prisoner doesn't

163
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,878
write back

164
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:04,239
they just might not have the money

165
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,160
so and then we get more into the little

166
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,960
niche rules of writing to a prisoner

167
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,599
in the federal system um the federal

168
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,400
system

169
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,919
started rolling out very very specific

170
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,960
rules of how you can

171
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,680
write to a prisoner and these rules are

172
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,479
horrible

173
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,599
they are draconian and as always

174
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,039
especially in prison

175
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,440
the cruelty is the point um

176
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,159
these rules include things like you are

177
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,120

178
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,560

previously allowed they're not

191

nothing uh even a return address label

197
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,760
that is a sticker

198
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,760
sense of any kind on your paper that

199
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,839

202
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,399
letter did uh

203
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,080
jeremy actually uh jeremy hammond

204
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,480
somebody who i've done prison support

205
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,839
for

206
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,600
um somebody actually uh had very strong

207
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,120
son of spices on their letter because

208
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,480
they were using it

209
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,240
uh they were writing it when they were

210
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,519
cooking that actually caused

211
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,680
the letter to be rejected um

212
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,800
but sometimes even if you follow all of

213
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,079
the rules

214
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,000
uh your letter will still be rejected uh

215
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,040
i included these two tweets because

216
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,120
sometimes it just

217
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,959
all comes down to who's in the mail room

218
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,320
on a certain day

219
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,959
um jeremy was sent the exact same book

220
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,839
at two different prisons one prison

221
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,359
accepted it

222
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:20,399
one prison rejected it uh why

223
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,160
who knows uh jeremy has

224
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,760
had dozens if not hundreds of letters

225
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,760
and books rejected

226
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,240
for various reasons as you can see in

227
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,959
2016

228
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,079
he was allowed to both get and read

229
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,040
hacker hoe

230
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,160
hacker hoaxer whistleblower spy by

231
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,599
abiela

232
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,240
coleman at fci manchester which is a

233
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,680
medium

234
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:51,040
security prison um but in 2018

235
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,079
at fci ma milan which is

236
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:57,599
curiously enough a low security pr

237
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,279
prison um that same book was rejected

238
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,320
and he was not allowed to

239
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,800
receive it so again

240
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,640
mail restrictions are often capricious

241
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,800
and subject to

242
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,880
honestly who's in the mail room on any

243
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,479
particular day

244
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,920
um again and some other things that you

245
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,040
can do to

246
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,079
help prisoners books another great way

247
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,160
to help them oftentimes uh books

248
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,120
must be sent directly from a publisher

249
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,800
or distributor

250
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,279
such as amazon.com i know we all hate

251
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,920
that

252
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,760
but unfortunately it is oftentimes the

253
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,560
only way that books are allowed to be

254
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,680
sent

255
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,239
um sending money to a prisoner allows

256
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,199
them to

257
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,880
purchase things like pen paper stamps so

258
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,880
they can write right back to you but it

259
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,920
also allows them to

260
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,839
um purchase phone time purchase

261
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,360
computer time so they can again another

262
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,560
way that they can keep in touch with

263
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,600
friends and

264
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,880
loved ones uh putting money on a

265
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,200
prisoner's books

266
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,240
in the federal system easiest way using

267
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,360
western

268
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,360
union if they're in the state system

269
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,040
there are so many ways that different

270
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,399
state or county prisons

271
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,599
uh put money on prisoners books you're

272
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,959
honestly if

273
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,240
someone's in the state system you're

274
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,399
just gonna have to look up how their

275
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,040
particular person does

276
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,920
does it cause there are just so many

277
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,480
ways uh

278
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,160
jake jpeg is a big one it's honestly

279
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,519
just down to what prison

280
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,880
a particular person is in so

281
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,120
that is a quick rundown of how to write

282
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,399
a prisoner

283
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,279

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,519
german

286
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:48,000
and i guess the translation team will

287
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,279
have to swap this around in the article

288
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,959
in the final

289
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,959

okay then

301
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,209
the system is kind of annoying

303
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,120

yeah there you go

307
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,000
hello thank you for having me so i did

308
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,240
four years in the feds from 2012 2016.

309
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,040
uh it's involved in some anonymous uh

310
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,480
goings-on

311
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,240
back in the day uh so

312
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,600
obviously you know as i think it's been

313
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,680
noted already state

314
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,639
and federal prisons in the u.s differ in

315
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,560
terms of their rules

316
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,639
state prisons differ among themselves

317
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,279
new york state california state texas

318
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,040
state

319
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,320
uh they'll have individual rules

320
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,480
regulations for all this stuff

321
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,959
ans has already been alluded to these

322
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,920
rules and regulations are often uh

323
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,719
moot uh what it comes down to is the

324
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,519
whim

325
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,160
of those who are placed in charge this

326
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,079
is

327
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,279
true in most facets of american life

328
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,479
it's particularly true in the prison

329
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,680
systems

330
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:50,079
uh someone such as uh

331
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:53,439
squiggle here a support contact it is

332
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,839
a fine thing for a prisoner to have uh

333
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,120
for a number of reasons uh but

334
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,800
especially when it comes to giving

335
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,839
communications initiating communications

336
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,920
with a prisoner

337
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,000
uh a person like that can can you know

338
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,438
be in charge of letting people know what

339
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,160
the regulations are

340
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,120
where they've moved to um and sort of

341
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,959
facilitating

342
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,639
uh all of the different difficulties and

343
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,720
barriers that can arise

344
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,480
uh when dealing with the prison system

345
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,039
uh and they can also

346
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,520
you know be warn or make make people

347
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,280
aware

348
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,879
of particular circumstances that might

349
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,480
need to be uh considered

350
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,240
when writing to a particular prisoner at

351
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,599
a particular time uh

352
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,039
these are you know these go beyond

353
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,480
summary it's hard to summarize what

354
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,799
these issues are there's just so many of

355
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,880
them

356
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,720
uh and they can change and so that's

357
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,200
always an important thing to have

358
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,200
uh i'm actually uh

359
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,840
the writings if you are writing to

360
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,440
prisoners uh

361
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,959
there are aspects of that kind of that

362
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,919
kind of activity that

363
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,400
i feel can be thought of more that can

364
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,080
be kind of

365
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,000
could be refined and enhanced in order

366
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,918
to achieve more of the end results at

367
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,840
the same time as achieving the basic end

368
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,080
of supporting that prisoner in a way

369
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,959
and i'll go into that in a bit but uh to

370
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,240
the extent you are

371
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,559
simply writing to a prisoner that is

372
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,919
your goal uh

373
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,760
there are a number of ways that this

374
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,280
does help aside from simply getting the

375
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,799
prisoner you know and moral

376
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:16,480
uh morale boost uh prisoners who receive

377
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:18,960
regular mail they gain respect

378
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,840
among other prisoners uh and that can be

379
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,160
more or less more

380
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,678
or you know useful in some circumstances

381
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,280
than others uh it can help them to

382
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,520
establish authority

383
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,720
i can help them to uh it can help to

384
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,280
give the sense

385
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,640
to the staff administration and guards

386
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,039
that this prisoner has

387
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,640
people on the outside that are uh

388
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,960
watching the prisoners back

389
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,760
and that can have a great effect uh in

390
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,720
terms of

391
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,720
uh you know preventing staff from

392
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,200
engaging in in too much uh

393
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,080
due process violations or abuse so

394
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,919
that's very helpful

395
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,360
uh and also to the extent the prisoner

396
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,160
is intent on

397
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,959
or might choose to later on uh continue

398
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,679
their activism

399
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,880
within prison uh having the respect of

400
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,240
other inmates uh

401
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,320
that prompts inmates to come to them

402
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,360
with their problems uh give them you

403
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,520
know bring them

404
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,479
make them aware of the issues in the

405
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
prison they may not be aware of

406
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,280
otherwise

407
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,600
and uh it helps to establish trust uh

408
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,840
and and soft power uh in a situation

409
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,360
which soft power is is vastly useful

410
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,159
not push the prisoner but for the prison

411
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,959
itself that may need the prisoner's aid

412
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,480
uh a lot of some of the letters that

413
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,960
prisoners get are

414
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,559
are done in these group these events

415
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,919
held by things like the anarchist black

416
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,918
cross and so forth

417
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,280
where they have meetings uh you know

418
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,240
events like once a month to write the

419
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,160
prisoners

420
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,160
uh these there's

421
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,000
there's been mixed results from those uh

422
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,039
some meetings produced basically letters

423
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,480
where it's just all the kind of the same

424
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,039
like hi i'm writing to you from about a

425
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,320
meeting

426
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,320
i hope everything's well in there blah

427
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,879
blah that's it's all well and good

428
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,639
but those meetings in my view uh they

429
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,280
should evolve more guidance

430
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,039
uh as to particular contents you know of

431
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,720
the letter they're writing anyway

432
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,320
uh that should go to the prisoner uh

433
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,679
things like information as has already

434
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,200
been spoken about

435
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,120
on events uh there is a particular

436
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,240
special case of that kind of thing let

437
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,600
me know what's on the outside what's

438
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,799
going on the outside world that should

439
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,280
be attended to

440
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,400
that is providing tips on facial

441
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,440
problems

442
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,880
or tip uh or or uh you know just the

443
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,159
things of note that the prisoner may

444
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,600
need not be aware of especially

445
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:25,039
before trial or sentencing uh there is

446
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,039
you know in some of these cases like

447
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,000
mine there could be a complicated

448
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,919
backstory

449
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,679
that the prisoner may have very little

450
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,520
access to in terms of

451
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,120
fbi informants what's known about them

452
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,760
in terms of like you know things that

453
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,520
are

454
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,600
put out on twitter and so forth after

455
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,720
the arrest uh that may be useful for the

456
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,719
prisoners know

457
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,840
and that a lawyer uh for instance may

458
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,440
not may not

459
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,158
recognize uh as useful uh you know being

460
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,960
not conversant with the circumstances um

461
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,960
and so

462
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,320
to give you examples of that uh there

463
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,679
were people who were getting trying to

464
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,200
get involved in my uh

465
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,720
in my legal defense uh probably on my

466
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,400
legal defense network and the activism

467
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,679
surrounding that while i was in prison

468
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,520
that i didn't you know had no way of

469
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,280
knowing about uh one of those people was

470
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,679
cassandra fairbanks

471
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,399
and i was alerted to this by uh by you

472
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,320
know a

473
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,320
volunteer of mine from the past who made

474
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,080
me aware of what this person was

475
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,520
and why the support network should be

476
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,720
warned about her and later on she went

477
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,120
on to work with

478
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,720
uh the trump people and so forth and uh

479
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,479
it caused a lot of damage

480
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,760
in the community at large those are the

481
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,600
kind of things that a prisoner

482
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,799
you know oftentimes even if they have a

483
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,320
support person

484
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,960
that sport person may not be privy to

485
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,120
these things uh and so

486
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,720
that is an example of a very useful

487
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,080
impactful thing that you can do

488
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,760
with writing your prisoners make them

489
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,039
aware of those things that there's a

490
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,799
chance they're not already aware of and

491
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:48,640
that they should be aware of

492
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,840
there is as also been mentioned uh in

493
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,280
the federal system and

494
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,039
increasingly in other systems i think

495
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,600
state systems as well in the us

496
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,000
uh even there's an email system an

497
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,559
ersatz email system it's very it's very

498
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,240
uh hedged in it's very kind of aol ish

499
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,360
in terms of it's not actually email

500
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,919
it's it's very much uh presided over by

501
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,959
by a structure the dop bureau of prisons

502
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,880
uh runs

503
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,080
uh that is a great alternative in some

504
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,000
cases to letters now

505
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,520
you don't get the same impact of that

506
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,880
prisoner getting all these getting all

507
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,720
this mail all the time

508
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,240
uh with that you don't have that visible

509
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,000
like here's your mound of mail

510
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,760
important prisoner kind of thing i

511
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
talked about earlier but under some

512
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,960
circumstances that can be a more

513
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,559
viable method of communicating uh again

514
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,000
depending very much on the

515
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,918
on the individual particulars of the

516
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,679
case and so forth

517
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,960
but uh obviously and when it's when it

518
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,159
comes to a correspondence when there's

519
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,919
someone when there's for some reason a

520
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,840
prisoner has identified you as someone

521
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,760
who they wants to hear more from

522
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,199
uh and be able to ask questions of

523
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,600
sending getting that email set up

524
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,720
at their invitation is a great way to go

525
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,678
about things

526
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,080
uh likewise phones as mentioned you can

527
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,159
put

528
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,520
money on uh prisoners phones you put

529
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,360
them on the on the books directly on

530
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,120
there on their accounts at prison

531
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,320
uh if you if you write a letter to a

532
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,678
prisoner it might be a good idea if

533
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
you'd like to put your phone number at

534
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,520
the end

535
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,600
and tell them you're putting five

536
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,240
dollars or something on their uh prison

537
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
accounts

538
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,280
so if they wish to they can call you

539
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,760
back easily if not they can

540
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,480
buy some coffee um just depends on how

541
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,440
entertaining

542
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,720
your letter is i suppose all right i

543
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,400
don't want to cut your shirt but we also

544
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,240
need to give ryan some time and we have

545
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:25,679
four minutes left uh

546
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,080
books and books um send books as needed

547
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,120
final

548
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,879
rules and uh etc magazines are great

549
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,039
um and that's all i have to say thank

550
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,559
you

551
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:40,080
thank you and uh i'm trying to

552
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:43,520
slide again yeah

553
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,199
yeah i'm jeremy ryan i have done 19 of

554
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,559
the past 25 months in

555
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,240
county jails well minus one week at mcc

556
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,200
chicago where i got sang too by r kelly

557
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,720
at night

558
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,039
but uh outside of that um

559
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,480
i it's been for political activism it's

560
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,039
mainly been in county jails

561
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,400
and county jails are significantly worse

562
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,879
than prisons uh

563
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,799
state prisons or federal prisons that's

564
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,840
part of how the american justice system

565
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,440
ropes you in

566
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,799
they put you in this horrible

567
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,039
environment when you're legally

568
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,639
considered innocent

569
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,039
and they put you in this horrible

570
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,279
environment to try to get you to cave

571
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,200
in my federal case they were trying to

572
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,840
get me to cave to a nuclear terrorism

573
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,679
charge

574
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,678
i became the first person to be charged

575
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,240
federally under 2332i

576
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,240
acts of nuclear terrorism and six months

577
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,200
into the 16 months they offered me time

578
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,360
served

579
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,039
and they said just take the terrorism

580
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,918
charge we'll let you out

581
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,480
and i did every day of the next 10

582
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,320
months

583
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,840
not being able to get out they also have

584
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,320
horrible medical care

585
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,520
so if people with medical issues need

586
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,559
people on the outside

587
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,960
able to convey that there was one time

588
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,080
when i had i was taking out my contact

589
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,159
because they don't give you enough

590
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,360
contact lens solution so i

591
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,799
uh wore them a little bit too

592
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,479
aggressively i was taking it out and

593
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,720
lacerated my eye

594
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,600
it took them 18 hours to get me to a

595
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,279
hospital

596
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,439
as my eye is like bleeding and um

597
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,360
and i it was only because i had people

598
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,400
on the outside calling 9-1-1

599
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,158
locally and saying that i was uh

600
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,679
i was needed you know medical attention

601
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,679
was needed and obviously they wouldn't

602
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,480
go but it was clogging up the 9-1-1

603
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,760
center

604
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,880
um but it also just means a lot uh

605
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,640
to get mail it means a lot for a wide

606
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,559
variety of reasons but a lot of these

607
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,240
a lot of people a lot of activists they

608
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,799
don't get a whole lot of mail

609
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,320
and so it's it tends to make them

610
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,760
sometimes think um

611
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,520
you know if they don't get the national

612
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,039
stories then people don't really write

613
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,559
and so sometimes they think people don't

614
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,879
really have their back

615
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,760
and uh so it can really help to have

616
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,000
people say

617
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,879
you know yeah you know we we know about

618
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,320
you we

619
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,200
we support you um and outside of that

620
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,039
uh you know just money on books there's

621
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,200
in particular particularly in jails

622
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,039
there's these systems like getting out

623
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,120
where you can send messages to people in

624
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:06,000
all sorts of jails across the country

625
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,799
um some of them like the guy in dane

626
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,520
county

627
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,639
um that i that i had posted uh who's

628
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,639
currently

629
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:17,919
he's being accused of uh firebombing the

630
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:21,039
the police station downtown um but he is

631
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,640
in jail and um they have they have a

632
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,320
little messaging system called getting

633
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,159
out where you can send

634
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,158
kind of like instant messages with the

635
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,080
with the inmates so there's all sorts of

636
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:34,400
ways in all sorts of different places

637
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,799
but regardless uh us jails in particular

638
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,559
are horribly shitty and there's nothing

639
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,039
there's literally nothing to do all day

640
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,799
except

641
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,799
maybe read a book from the book card

642
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:45,520
that's been there the whole six months

643
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,600
or uh watch whatever someone else is

644
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,200
watching on tv

645
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,600
outside of that there's not really a

646
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,880
whole lot so you know even just a small

647
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,158
thing like the letter

648
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,360
helps to break the monotony uh and show

649
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,000
that you have support

650
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,678
uh and yeah i can't talk too much about

651
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,440
prisons because like i said i only spent

652
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,080
one week at mcc chicago

653
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,000
on the fed case thing but i was on uh

654
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,520
six floor 16 which at the time was the

655
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,799
same floor as our kelly and they were

656
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,879
making us sing them to

657
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,480
sing everybody to sleep it was kind of

658
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,520
funny but either way

659
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,760
um yeah uh thank you for

660
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,520
having me and uh thank you for doing

661
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,559
this because i know it's gonna make a

662
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,600
a big difference to a lot of people and

663
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,120
um

664
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,120
and that's really what we need we need

665
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,279
people to continue the fight we need

666
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,439
people once they get out of jail

667
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,720
to be motivated to get a door person to

668
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,840
be motivated to continue

669
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,679
fighting um because not everybody is

670
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,799
going to necessarily have the same

671
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,120
level of resilience as uh as someone

672
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,320
like

673
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,760
say myself or barrett um or the other

674
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,760
gentleman there

675
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,120
and sometimes your support will make the

676
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,960
difference on whether they'll have that

677
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,158
resilience or not

678
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,240
