1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:10,520
[Music]

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,520
[Applause]

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,720
all right so again

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,960
let's um introduce the next talk

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,359
accessible inputs for readers

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,359
coders and hackers the talk by david

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,800
williams king about

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,119
custom off well not off the shelf but

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,079
custom accessibility solutions

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,760
he will give you some demonstrations and

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,440
that includes his own custom-made voice

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,040
input and eyelid bling system

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,040
here is david williams king

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,559
thank you for the introduction um let's

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,718
go ahead and get started so yeah i'm

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,280
talking about accessibility particularly

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,199
accessible input for readers coders and

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,559
hackers

19
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,039
so what do i mean by accessibility i

20
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,480
mean

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,120
people that have physical or motor

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,760
impairments this could be due to

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,119
repetitive strain injury carpal tunnel

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,280
all kinds of medical

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,119
conditions if you have this type of

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,119
thing you probably can't use a normal

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,400
computer keyboard computer mouse

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,200
or even a phone touch screen

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,119
however technology does allow users to

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,960
interact with these devices just using

31
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,600
different forms of input

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,119
and it's really valuable to these people

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,720
because

34
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,720
you know being able to interact with a

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,720
device provides some agency

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,400
they can they can do things on their own

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,840
and it provides a means of communication

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,920
with the outside world

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,680
so it's an important problem to look at

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,079
and

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,960
it's one i care about a lot let's talk a

42
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,000
bit about me for a moment i'm a

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,759
systems security person i did a phd in

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,439
cyber security at columbia if you're

45
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,600
interested in low-level

46
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,720
software defenses you can look that up

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,719
and i'm currently

48
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:59,679
the cto at a startup called alpha secure

49
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,839
i i started developing medical issues in

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,320
around 2014

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,159
and as a result of that in an ongoing

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,038
fashion i can only type a few thousand

53
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,319
keystrokes per day roughly 15 000 is my

54
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,920
maximum

55
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,560
that sounds like a lot but imagine

56
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,040
you're typing at 100 words per minute

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,400
that's 500 characters per minute which

58
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,640
means

59
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,520
it takes you 30 minutes to hit 15 000

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,440
characters

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,480
so essentially i

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,040
i can work like the equivalent of a fast

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,399
programmer for for half an hour

64
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,879
and then after that i would be unable to

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,560
use my hands for anything including like

66
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,239
you know preparing food for myself or

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,879
opening and closing doors and so on so i

68
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,560
have to

69
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,079
be very careful about my hand use and i

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,080
actually have a little program that you

71
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,480
can see on the slide there

72
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,239
that measures the keystrokes for me so i

73
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,879
can tell when i'm going over

74
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,680
um so what do i do well i do a lot of

75
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,440
pair programming

76
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,239
for sure i log into the same machine as

77
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,920
other people and we work together

78
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,280
i'm also a very heavy user of speech

79
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,440
recognition and

80
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,440
i gave a talk at that about voice coding

81
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,800
with speech recognition

82
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,760
at the hope 11 conference so you can go

83
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,440
check that out if you're interested

84
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,120
so when i talk about accessible input i

85
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,480
mean

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,159
different ways that a human can provide

87
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,319
input to a computer so

88
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,599
ergonomic keyboards are a simple one

89
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,440
speech recognition

90
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,640
eye tracking or gaze tracking so you can

91
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,680
see where

92
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,200
where you're looking or where you're

93
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,799
pointing your head and maybe use that to

94
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,920
replace a mouse

95
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,159
that's head gestures i suppose and

96
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,238
there's always this distinction between

97
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:41,679
bespoke like custom input mechanisms and

98
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,599
somewhat mainstream ones so

99
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,959
i'll give you some examples you've

100
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,798
probably heard of stephen hawking

101
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,560
he's a very famous professor and he was

102
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,080
actually a bit of an extreme case he had

103
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:58,640
he was diagnosed with als when he was 21

104
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,000
so his his physical abilities degraded

105
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,359
over the years because he lived for many

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,720
decades after that

107
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,799
and he went through many communication

108
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,480
mechanisms initially

109
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,080
his speech changed so that it was only

110
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,040
intelligible to his family and close

111
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,280
friends

112
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,879
um but he was still able to speak and

113
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,319
then after that

114
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,238
he would uh work with a human

115
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,519
interpreter and raise his eyebrows

116
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,599
to pick various letters and then

117
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,639
and keep in mind this is like the 60s or

118
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,720
70s right so

119
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,639
computers were not really where they are

120
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,160
today

121
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,160
later he would operate a switch with one

122
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,800
hand just like on off on off

123
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,840
kind of morse code and select from a

124
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,000
bank of words

125
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,080
and that was around 15 words per minute

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,320
uh eventually he was unable to move his

127
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,080
hand so

128
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,759
a team of engineers from intel worked

129
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,120
with him and they figured out

130
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,320
they were trying to do like brain scans

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,880
and all kinds of stuff but again this

132
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,080
was

133
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,199
like in the 80s so there was uh not uh

134
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,359
not too much they could do so they

135
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,160
basically just created

136
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,680
um some custom software to to detect

137
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,560
muscle movements in his cheek

138
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,840
and he used that with predictive um

139
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,400
predictive words the same way that a

140
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,000
phone

141
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,520
smartphone keyboard will predict like

142
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,720
which word you want to say next

143
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,080
stephen hawking used something similar

144
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,560
to that except instead of swiping on a

145
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,240
phone

146
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,479
he was moving his uh his cheek muscles

147
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,000
so that's obviously a sequence of like

148
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,159
highly customized

149
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,840
input mechanisms for for someone and

150
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,840
very very specialized for that person

151
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,840
i also want to talk about someone else

152
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,039
named professor song mukli

153
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,400
whom i i've met that was me when i had

154
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:35,199
more of a beard than i do now um

155
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,880
he uh he's a professor at seoul national

156
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,400
university in south korea

157
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,240
and he he sometimes called like

158
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,758
the korean stephen hawking because he's

159
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,120
a big advocate for people with

160
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,080
disabilities and whatnot

161
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,520
anyway what he uses is you can see a

162
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,159
little orange device near his mouth

163
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,400
there

164
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,160
he it's called a sip and puff mouse so

165
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,758
he can blow into it

166
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,160
and suck air through it and also move it

167
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,000
around and that acts as a mouse

168
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,919
cursor on the android device in front of

169
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,919
him it will uh

170
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,198
move the cursor around and click when he

171
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,680
when he blows air and so on um

172
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,960
so that combined with speech recognition

173
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,720
lets him use

174
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,599
mainstream android hardware right he

175
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,400
still has access to

176
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,120
you know email apps and like web

177
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,679
browsers

178
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,400
and like maps and everything that comes

179
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,080
on a normal android device so

180
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,280
he's way more capable than stephen

181
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,599
hawking was because stephen hawking

182
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,919
could

183
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,319
communicate but just to a person at a

184
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,758
very slow rate right

185
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,080
part of us due to the nature of his

186
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,919
injury but it's also

187
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,400
a testament to how far the technology

188
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,400
has improved

189
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,360
um so let's talk a little bit about what

190
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,960
makes good accessibility uh

191
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,560
i think performance is very important

192
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,840
right you want high accuracy you don't

193
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,680
want typos

194
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,359
low latency i don't want to speak and

195
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,759
then five seconds later have words

196
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,080
appear

197
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,440
it's too it's too long um especially if

198
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,680
i have to make corrections right

199
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,960
and you want high throughput which we

200
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,240
already talked about oh i forgot to

201
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,758
mention stephen hawking had like you

202
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,520
know 15 words per minute

203
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:12,160
a normal person speaking is 150 so

204
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,159
that's a big difference the higher

205
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,240
throughput you can get the better

206
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,080
and for input accessibility i think and

207
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,039
this is not scientific this is just what

208
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,719
i've

209
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,479
learned from using myself and observing

210
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,360
many of these systems i think it's

211
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,599
important to get

212
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,479
completeness consistency and

213
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,479
customization

214
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,000
for completeness i mean can i do any

215
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,919
action so

216
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,199
stephen or um uh professor sung mukli

217
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:40,639
uh his his uh orange

218
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,240
mouth input device the sip and puff is

219
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,080
quite powerful but it doesn't let him do

220
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,599
every action for example for some reason

221
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,599
when he gets an incoming call

222
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,440
the the input doesn't work so he has to

223
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,280
call over a person physically to like

224
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,000
tap the accept call button or the reject

225
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,280
call button

226
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,280
which is really annoying right if you

227
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,520
don't have completeness you can't be

228
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,000
fully independent

229
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,359
um consistency very important as well

230
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,160
the same way we develop

231
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,800
motor memory for a muscle memory for a

232
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,440
keyboard

233
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,960
you develop memory for any types of

234
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,639
patterns that you do but if the thing

235
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,440
you say or the thing you do keeps

236
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,199
changing

237
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,960
in order to do the same action that's

238
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,080
not good

239
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,198
and finally customization so the

240
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,719
learning curve for beginners is

241
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,319
important for any accessibility device

242
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,240
but

243
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,240
designing for expert use is almost more

244
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,759
important because

245
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,840
anyone who uses an accessibility

246
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,440
interface becomes an expert at it

247
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,958
the example i like to give is screen

248
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,880
readers like a blind person

249
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,958
using a screen reader on a phone they

250
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,320
will crank up the speed at which

251
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:42,559
the speech is being produced

252
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,399
and i actually met someone who made his

253
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,640
speech 16 times

254
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,880
faster than normal human speech i could

255
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,080
not understand it at all instead of like

256
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,439
but he could understand it perfectly and

257
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,560
that's just because he used it so much

258
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,480
that he'd become an expert

259
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,839
at its use um let's analyze ergonomic

260
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,560
keywords just for a moment because it's

261
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,120
fun

262
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,399
uh you know they are kind of like a

263
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,000
normal keyboard they'll have a

264
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,519
you'll have a slow pace when you're

265
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,240
starting to learn them but once you're

266
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,920
good at it

267
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,839
you have very good accuracy like

268
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,479
instantaneous low latency right you

269
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,720
press a key

270
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,600
the computer receives it immediately and

271
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,240
very high throughput

272
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,200
is as high as you are on a regular

273
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,040
keyboard

274
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,320
so they're actually fantastic

275
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,680
accessibility devices right they're

276
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,959
completely compatible with original

277
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,319
keyboards

278
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,439
and if all you need is an ergonomic

279
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,880
keyboard then you're in luck because

280
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,880
it's a very good accessibility device

281
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,640
um i'm going to talk about two things

282
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,040
computers but also android devices so

283
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,720
let's

284
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,240
start with android devices um

285
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,399
yes the built-in voice recognition in

286
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,600
android is really incredible so even

287
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,440
though the microphones on

288
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,880
the devices aren't great google has just

289
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,920
collected so much data from so many

290
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,519
different sources

291
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,120
that they've built like better than

292
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,040
human accuracy for

293
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,720
for their voice recognition the voice

294
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,800
accessibility interface

295
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,399
is kind of so-so we'll talk about that

296
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,160
in a bit that's the interface where you

297
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,079
can control the android device entirely

298
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,519
by voice

299
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,279
for other input mechanisms you could use

300
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,079
like a sip and puff device

301
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,200
or you could use physical styluses um

302
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,399
that's something that i do a lot

303
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,640
actually because for me

304
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,839
my fingers get sore and if i can hold a

305
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,079
stylus in my hand

306
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,120
and kind of not use my fingers then

307
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,800
that's

308
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,959
you know very effective so and the

309
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,000
elecom styluses from a japanese company

310
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,439
are

311
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,200
the lightest i've found and they don't

312
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,800
require a lot of force so the

313
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,079
ones at the top there are um

314
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,319
they're like 12 grams and the one the

315
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,760
bottom is 4.7 grams and

316
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,760
you require almost no force to use them

317
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,240
so very nice on the left there you can

318
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,839
see

319
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,680
the android speech recognition is built

320
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,200
into the keyboard now right

321
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,040
you can just press that and start

322
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,839
speaking it supports different languages

323
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,160
and it's very accurate it's very nice

324
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,320
and actually

325
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,519
when i was working at google for a bit i

326
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,160
talked to the speech recognition team

327
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,680
and i was like

328
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,719
why are you doing on server speech

329
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,439
recognition you should do it on the

330
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,120
devices

331
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,720
but of course android devices are

332
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,920
they're all very different and many of

333
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,279
them are not very powerful so they were

334
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,000
having trouble getting

335
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,920
um satisfactory speech recognition on

336
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,519
the device so for a long time

337
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,719
there's some server latency server lag

338
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,320
right you do speech recognition and you

339
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,079
wait a bit

340
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,680
and then sometime this year i just was

341
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,239
using speech recognition and it became

342
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,680
so much faster i was extremely excited

343
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,360
and i looked into it and

344
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,279
yeah they just switched on my device at

345
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,279
least they switched on the on-device

346
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,720
speech recognition model and so now it's

347
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,839
incredibly fast and also incredibly

348
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,200
accurate i'm a huge fan of it

349
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,880
um on the right hand side we can

350
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,000
actually see the voice access interface

351
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,920
so this is meant

352
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,600
to allow you to use a phone entirely by

353
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,079
voice again while i was at google i

354
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,519
tried

355
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,880
the beta version before it was publicly

356
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,279
released and i was like this is pretty

357
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,800
bad

358
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,519
um mostly because it didn't it lacked

359
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,959
completeness

360
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,040
there would be things on the screen that

361
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,279
would not be selected so here we see

362
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,760
show labels and then i can i can say

363
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,240
like four five six whatever to tap

364
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,760
on that thing but as you can see at the

365
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,639
bottom there's like a twitter web app

366
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,000
link

367
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,760
and there's no number on it so if i want

368
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,320
to click on that i'm out of luck

369
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,839
and this is actually a problem in the

370
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,160
design of

371
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,920
the accessibility interface it it only

372
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,279
it doesn't expose the full dom

373
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,599
it exposes only um a subset of it and so

374
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,959
an accessibility mechanism can't ever

375
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,560
see those other

376
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,079
things um and furthermore

377
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,839
the way the google speech recognition

378
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,439
works they have to re-establish a new

379
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,279
connection every 30 seconds

380
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,560
um and if you're in the middle of

381
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,760
speaking it will just throw away

382
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,279
whatever you were saying because it just

383
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,439
decided it had to reconnect

384
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,760
which is really unfortunate um they

385
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,360
later released that publicly and then

386
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,439
sometime this year they did an update

387
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,000
update which is pretty nice it now has

388
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,240
like a

389
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,360
a mouse grid which lets which solves a

390
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,560
lot of the completeness problems like

391
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,480
you can

392
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,839
you can use a grid to narrow down

393
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,720
somewhere on the screen and then tap

394
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,920
there

395
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,079
um but the server issues and the

396
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,839
uh like expert use is still not good

397
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,279
like okay if i want to

398
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,399
turn up if i want to do something with

399
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,959
the mouse grid i have to say mouse grid

400
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,680
on

401
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,359
six five mouse grid off and i can't

402
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,239
combine those together so there's a lot

403
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,399
of latency

404
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,360
and it's not really that fun to use but

405
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,720
uh

406
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,079
better than nothing absolutely um

407
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,440
i just want to really briefly show you

408
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,800
as well that this same feature of like

409
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,079
being able to select

410
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,920
links on a screen is available on

411
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,800
desktops this is a plug-in for chrome

412
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,760
called vimium

413
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,359
and it's very powerful because you can

414
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,439
then combine this with

415
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,800
keyboards or other input mechanisms and

416
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,399
this one is complete

417
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,839
it uses the entire dom and anything you

418
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,680
can click on will be highlighted so it's

419
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,360
very nice

420
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,719
i just want to give a quick example of

421
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,040
me using some of these systems so

422
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,399
i've been trying to learn japanese and

423
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,599
there's a couple of highly regarded

424
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,800
websites for this but they're not

425
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,199
consistent

426
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,880
when i use the browser show labels like

427
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,959
you know the the thing to press

428
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,120
next page or something like that or like

429
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,760
you know i give up or whatever

430
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,279
is it keeps changing so the the letters

431
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,720
that are being used keep changing and

432
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,320
that's because of the dynamic way that

433
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,560
they're generating the html

434
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,440
so not really very useful what i do

435
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,319
instead is i use

436
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,839
a program called anki and that has very

437
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,880
simple shortcuts in his desktop app one

438
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,079
two three four

439
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,439
so it's nice to use and consistent and

440
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,040
it syncs with an android app and then i

441
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:14,639
can use my stylus on the android device

442
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,839
so it works pretty well but even so

443
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,040
you know as you can see from the chart

444
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,040
on the bottom there there are many days

445
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,719
when i can't use this even though i

446
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,279
would like to because i've overused my

447
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,320
hands

448
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,680
or i've overused my voice um when i'm

449
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,440
using voice recognition all day every

450
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,638
day i do tend to lose my voice and as

451
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,680
you can see from the graph sometimes i

452
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,800
lose it for like

453
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,079
a week or two at a time so same thing

454
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,399
with any accessibility interface you

455
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,319
know

456
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,440
you've got to use many different

457
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,360
techniques and

458
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,560
it's always it's never perfect it's just

459
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,560
the best you can do at that moment

460
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,480
um something else i like to do is read

461
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,680
books i read a lot of books

462
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,760
and um i love ebook readers you know the

463
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,959
dedicated e-ink displays

464
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,680
you can read them in sunlight they last

465
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,439
forever battery-wise um

466
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,638
unfortunately it's hard to add like

467
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,720
other input mechanisms to them they

468
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,240
don't have microphones or other sensors

469
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,320
and you can't really install custom

470
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,880
software on them but for android-based

471
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,720
devices

472
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,079
and they're also like ebook reading apps

473
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,279
for android devices

474
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,319
they have everything you can install

475
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,320
custom software and they have

476
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,560
microphones and many other

477
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,440
sensors so i made two apps that allow

478
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,119
you to read

479
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,920
ebooks with an ebook reader the first

480
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,480
one is voice next page

481
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,160
it's based on one of my speech

482
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,079
recognition engine called sylvias

483
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,680
and it does do server based recognition

484
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,758
so you have to capture all the audio

485
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,719
use 300 kilobits a second to send it to

486
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,800
the server

487
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,160
and recognize things like next page

488
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,160
previous page

489
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,439
um however it doesn't cut out every 30

490
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,439
seconds

491
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,639
it keeps going so that's that's one one

492
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,759
win for it i guess

493
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,399
and it uh it is published in the play

494
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,560
store

495
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,600
huge thanks to sarah leventhal who did a

496
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,638
lot of the implementation

497
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,880
very complicated to make an

498
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,320
accessibility app on android but

499
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,279
we persevered and works quite nicely so

500
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,720
i'm going to actually show you an

501
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,320
example of voice next page

502
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,720
this is uh this over here this is my

503
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,720
phone

504
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,079
on the left hand side just captured so

505
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,240
that you guys can see it so here's the

506
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:12,160
voice next page

507
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,600
and um basically the connection is green

508
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,199
i can do the the servers up and running

509
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,560
and so on i just press start and then

510
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,758
i'll switch to

511
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,719
an android reading app and say next page

512
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,560
previews page i won't

513
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,600
speak otherwise because it will it will

514
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,599
chapel everything i'm saying

515
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,839
next page next page

516
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,800
previous page

517
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,000
center center

518
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,839
foreground stop listening

519
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,758
so that's the demo of the voice next

520
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,199
page and it's extremely helpful i i've

521
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,320
built i built it a couple of years ago

522
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,280
along with sarah

523
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,240
and i use it a lot um so yeah you can go

524
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,839
ahead and download it if you guys want

525
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,520
to try it out

526
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,678
and the other one is called blink next

527
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,679
page so the idea for this

528
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,880
i got this idea from a research paper

529
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,000
this year that was

530
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,280
studying eyelid gestures um i didn't

531
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,079
use any of their code but it's a great

532
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,199
idea so the way this works is

533
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,918
you detect blinks by using the android

534
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,919
camera

535
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,280
and then you can trigger an action like

536
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,280
turning pages in an ebook reader

537
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,400
this actually doesn't need any

538
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,120
networking it's able to use the on

539
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,760
device

540
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,039
face recognition models from google and

541
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,320
it is still under development so it's

542
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,600
not on the play store yet

543
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,879
but uh it is working and uh

544
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,520
you know please contact me if you want

545
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:53,039
to try it so just give me

546
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,039
one moment to set that demo up here and

547
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,840
so i'm going to use the the main problem

548
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,520
with this

549
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,879
the main problem with this current

550
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,000
implementation is that it uses two

551
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,120
devices

552
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,400
so that was easier to implement and i

553
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,559
use two devices anyway

554
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,559
but obviously i want a

555
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,400
a one device version if i'm actually

556
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,280
going to use it for anything so here's

557
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,160
how this works

558
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,360
this device i point at me at my eyes the

559
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,200
other device i put wherever it's

560
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,918
convenient to read

561
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,760
oops sorry and if i blink my eyes

562
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,960
the phone will buzz once it detects that

563
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,240
i've blinked my eyes and it will turn

564
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,080
the page automatically

565
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,760
on the other android device

566
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,918
now i have to blink both my eyes for

567
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,200
half a second if i want to go

568
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,919
backwards i can blink just my left eye

569
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,919
and if i want to go forwards like

570
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,480
quickly i can blink my right eye

571
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,480
and hold it

572
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,880
anyway um it does have some false

573
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,760
positives that's why like

574
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,679
you can go backwards in case it detects

575
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,679
that you've accidentally

576
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,960
flipped the page and lighting is also

577
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,840
very important like if i have a light

578
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,760
behind me

579
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,520
then this is not going to be able to

580
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,480
identify whether my eyes are open or

581
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,000
closed properly

582
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,440
so it has some limitations but very

583
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,160
um very simple to use so

584
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,160
i'm a big fan

585
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,559
uh okay so that's enough about android

586
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,520
devices let's talk

587
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,399
very briefly about desktop computers so

588
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,400
if you're going to use

589
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,720
a desktop computer of course try using

590
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,799
that show labels plug-in in a browser

591
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,000
for native apps you can try dragon

592
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,480
naturally speaking

593
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,320
which is fine if you're just like using

594
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,679
basic things but if you're trying to do

595
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,678
complicated things you should definitely

596
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,960
use a voice coding system

597
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,799
you could also consider using eye

598
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,720
tracking to replace a mouse i

599
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,720
personally i don't use that i find it

600
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,559
hurts my eyes but i do use a

601
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,840
trackball with very little force and a

602
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,600
welcome tablet

603
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,678
some people will even scroll up and down

604
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,320
by humming for example but i

605
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,559
don't have that setup there's a bunch of

606
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,879
nice talks out there on voice coding

607
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,320
the top left is tavis red's talk from

608
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,799
many years ago that got many of us

609
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,799
interested

610
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,000
emily shia gave a talk there um about

611
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,520
like

612
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,280
best practices for voice coding and then

613
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,760
i gave a talk a couple years ago

614
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,879
at the the hope 11 conference which you

615
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,120
can also check out

616
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,840
um it's mostly out of date by now but

617
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,199
it's still interesting

618
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,918
so there are a lot of voice coding

619
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,679
systems

620
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,000
the um sort of grandfather of the mall

621
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,480
is

622
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,159
dragonfly it's become a great grammar

623
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,720
standard

624
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,000
caster is if you're willing to memorize

625
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,720
lots of

626
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,320
unusual words you can become much better

627
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,080
much faster than i currently am at voice

628
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,320
coding

629
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,559
aenea is how you originally used dragon

630
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,200
to work on a linux machine for example

631
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,000
because

632
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,120
dragon only runs on windows talon is a

633
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,559
closed source

634
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,918
program which is uh but it's very

635
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,600
very powerful has a big user base

636
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,159
especially for mac os there are ports

637
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,760
now

638
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,520
and talon used to use dragon but it's

639
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,720
now using

640
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:06,158
a speech system from facebook

641
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,559
um sylvia's is the system that i created

642
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,520
the models are not very accurate but

643
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,360
it's a nice

644
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,720
architecture where there's client server

645
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,678
so it makes it easy to build things like

646
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,240
the voice next page

647
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,880
so the voice next page was using soleus

648
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,960
and then

649
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,960
the the most recent one i think on this

650
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,039
list is keldi active grammar

651
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,480
which is extremely powerful and

652
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,360
extremely customizable and it's also

653
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,520
open source

654
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,959
it works on all platforms so i i really

655
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,200
highly recommend that so let's talk a

656
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,400
bit more about county active grammar

657
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,600
but first um for voice coding i've

658
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,200
already mentioned you have to be careful

659
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,799
how you use your voice right

660
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,919
breathe from your belly don't don't

661
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,520
tighten your muscles and breathe from

662
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,039
your chest try to speak normally

663
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,639
and i'm not particularly good at this

664
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,039
like you'll hear me when i'm speaking

665
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,000
commands

666
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,120
my inflection changes so i do tend to

667
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,320
overuse my voice but

668
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,158
uh yeah yeah i just have to be conscious

669
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,559
of that the microphone hardware does

670
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,320
matter

671
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,840
i do recommend like a blue yeti on a

672
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,320
microphone arm that you can pull and put

673
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,320
close to your

674
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,240
close to your face like this i'll use

675
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,320
this one for my speaking demo

676
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,400
and uh yeah and the other thing is your

677
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,840
grammar is fully customizable so

678
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,200
if you keep saying a word and the system

679
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,840
doesn't recognize it just change it to

680
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,000
another word

681
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,439
and um it's complete in the sense you

682
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,200
can type any key on the keyboard

683
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,280
and the most important thing for expert

684
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,440
use or customizability is that

685
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,639
you can do chaining so with a voice

686
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,919
coding system you can say multiple

687
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,480
commands at once

688
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,400
uh if there's and it's a huge time

689
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,120
savings you'll see what i mean when i uh

690
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,799
when i give a quick demo um when i do

691
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,639

694
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,280
i've worked with many people before so i

695
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,480
have some cheat sheet information there

696
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,960
so if you're interested you can go check

697
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,799
that out

698
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,799
but yeah let's just do a quick demo of

726
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,400
so that's just a quick example of voice

727
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,918
coding um

728
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,679
you can use it to write any programming

729
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,919
language you can use it to control

730
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,120
anything on your desktop it's uh very

731
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,400
powerful

732
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,239
it has a bit of a learning curve but

733
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,240
it's very powerful

734
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,080
so the creator of county active grammar

735
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,960
is also named david

736
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,678
i'm named david but just a coincidence

737
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,000
um

738
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,039
and he's he says of county active

739
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,120
grammar that

740
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,320
um i haven't typed with a keyboard in

741
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,399
many years

742
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,520
and cal deactor grammar is bootstrapped

743
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,600
in that i have

744
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,120
been developing it entirely using the

745
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,719
previous versions of it

746
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,479
so uh david has a

747
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,640
medical condition that means he has very

748
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,919
low dexterity so it's hard for him to

749
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,400
use a keyboard and yeah he basically

750
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,480
got cal deactive grammar working through

751
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,320
the skin of his teeth or something

752
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,400
and then continues to develop it using

753
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,480
it and

754
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,240
yeah i i'm a huge fan of the project i

755
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,880
haven't contributed much but i did give

756
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,799
some of

757
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,559
the hardware resources like gpu and cpu

758
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:07,520
compete compute resources

759
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,279
to allow training to happen um but i

760
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,120
would also like to show you a video of

761
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,480
david using caldi active grammar

762
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,479
just so you can see it as well

763
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,840
so the other thing about david is that

764
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,159
he has

765
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,879
um he has a speech impediment or a

766
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,720
speech

767
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,640
i don't know an accent or whatever so

768
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,080
it's difficult to

769
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,679
for a normal speech recognition system

770
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,960
to understand him and you might have

771
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,159
trouble understanding him here but you

772
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,440
can see in the lower right

773
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,919
what the speech system understands that

774
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,919
he's saying

775
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,640
oh i realized that i do need to switch

776
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,678
something in obs so that you guys can

777
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,279
hear it sorry

778
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:46,320
there we go tab

779
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:50,000
number one simple camera space

780
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:53,760
number one on one content line

781
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,200
control shift enter text

782
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,240
okay one assignment apostrophe

783
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,640
account for entering two times okay

784
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,640
space

785
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,279
anyway you get the idea and hopefully

786
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,239
you guys are able to hear that if not

787
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:13,360
you can also find this on the website

788
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,360
that i'm going to show you at the end

789
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,279
oh one other thing i want to show you

790
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,279
about this is

791
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,199
david has actually set up this humming

792
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,199
to scroll which i think is pretty cool

793
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,600
of course i've gone and turned off the

794
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,520
obs there but he's basically

795
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,520
and it's understanding that and uh and

796
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,000
scrolling down so

797
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,440
something that i'm able to do with my uh

798
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,039
my trackball but that he's

799
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:42,799
using his voice for so it's pretty cool

800
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:44,799
um so i'm almost done here in summary

801
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,400
good input accessibility means you need

802
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,000
completeness consistency and

803
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,200
customization you need to be able to do

804
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,159
any action that you could do

805
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,279
with the other input mechanisms and

806
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,720
doing the same input should have the

807
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,640
same action

808
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,159
and remember your users will become

809
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,720
experts so

810
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,000
the system needs to be designed for that

811
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,080
for ebook reading

812
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,600
um yes we're trying i'm trying to allow

813
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,918
anyone to read even if they're

814
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,719
experiencing some severe physical or

815
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,960
motor impairment

816
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,640
because i think that gives you a lot of

817
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,039
power to be able to turn the pages

818
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,000
and read your favorite books and for

819
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,399
speech recognition yeah

820
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,120
android speech recognition is very good

821
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,439
silvius

822
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,120
accuracy is not so good but it's easy to

823
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,039
use quickly for experimentation

824
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,639
and to make other types of things like

825
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,080
the voice next page

826
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,080
and please do check out cali active

827
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,000
grammar if you have some serious need

828
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,799
for voice recognition

829
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,880
um lastly i put all this onto a website

830
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,360
voxhub dot io so you can see voice next

831
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,159

832
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,520
blink next page cody active grammar uh

833
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,480
and so on just instructions for how to

834
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,760
use it and how to set it up

835
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,279
so please do check that out and

836
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,320
tons of acknowledgements lots of people

837
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,279
that have helped me along the way but i

838
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,439
want to especially

839
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,880
call out professor song mugli who

840
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,440
actually invited me to korea a couple of

841
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,720
times

842
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,080
to give talks uh a big inspiration and

843
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,200
of course david zero has actually been

844
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,158
able to bootstrap

845
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,760
into a fully voice coding environment so

846
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,399
that's all i have for today

847
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,399
thank you very much

848
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,158
right um i suppose i'm back on the air

849
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,919
so

850
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,600
let me see uh i want to remind everyone

851
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,880
before we go into the q a

852
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,120
that um you can ask your questions

853
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,960
for this talk on irc the link is under

854
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,080
the video or you can use twitter or the

855
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,320
fetiverse with the hashtag

856
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:34,720
rc32 again i'll hold it up here rc

857
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,240
number three two and um

858
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,080
wow thanks for your talk david that was

859
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,919
really interesting thanks for talking

860
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,960
david um

861
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,640
i yeah

862
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,000
i think we have a couple of questions

863
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,320
from the signal angels

864
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,320
um before that i just want to say i

865
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,439
recently spent some time playing with a

866
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,320
like the voice over system in ios and

867
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,279
that can now actually tell you what is

868
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,399
on a photo

869
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,760
which is kind of amazing oh by the way i

870
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,080
can't hear you

871
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,679
here on on the marvel yeah sorry i

872
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,199
wasn't saying anything

873
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,480
uh yeah no it's it's so i focus mostly

874
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,559
on input accessibility right which is

875
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,320
like how do you get data to the computer

876
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,520
but there's been huge improvements in

877
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,240
the other way around as well right the

878
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,279
computer

879
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,559
yeah so we have about let's see five six

880
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,679
minutes left at least

881
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,678
for q a we have a question by toby plus

882
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,840
plus he asks your next page application

883
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,279
looks cool do you have statistics of how

884
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,039
many people use it or

885
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,039
found it on the app store

886
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,719
uh not very many the voice next page was

887
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,158
advertised

888
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,840
only so far as a little academic poster

889
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,799
so i've gotten a few people to use it

890
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,918
but i run eight concurrent workers

891
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:50,240
and we've never hit more than that

892
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,440
so not super not super popular but i do

893
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,640
hope that some people will see it

894
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,080
because of this talk and go and check

895
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,760
that's cool uh

896
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,199
next question how error prone are the

897
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,720
speech recognition systems

898
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,360
at all e.g can you do coding while doing

899
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,360
workouts

900
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,880
so one thing about speech recognition is

901
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:23,150
very sensitive to the microphone so

902
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:27,289
when you're doing it

903
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:27,289
[Music]

904
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,000
any mistakes right that's the thing

905
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,639
about having low latency you just say

906
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,120
something

907
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,960
and you watch it and you make sure that

908
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,879
it was what you wanted to say

909
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,320
i don't know exactly how many words per

910
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,520
second words per minute i can say with

911
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,039
voice coding but i can say it much

912
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,960
faster than regular speech so i would

913
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,240
say at least like 200 maybe 300 words

914
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,679
per minute so it's actually a very high

915
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,440
bandwidth that's pretty awesome

916
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:03,360
a question from pepe j and devos

917
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,960
any advice for software authors to make

918
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,959
their stuff more accessible

919
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:14,559
um there's there are good web

920
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,840
accessibility guidelines

921
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,279
so if you're just making a website or

922
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,000
something i would definitely follow

923
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,840
those

924
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,360
they tend to be focused more on people

925
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,000
that are blind because

926
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,360
that is you know it's more of an obvious

927
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,559
fail like they just can't interact at

928
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,600
all with your website

929
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:32,240
um but things like you know if

930
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,199
if duolingo for example had used the

931
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,559
same

932
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,840
like a the same accessibility um access

933
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,200
tag on their like

934
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,320
next button then i would they would

935
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,679
always be the same letter for me and i

936
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,600
wouldn't have to be like

937
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:48,559
fox charlie fox delta fox something

938
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,639
changes all the time so i think i think

939
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,720
consistency is very important

940
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,320
and integrating with any existing

941
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
accessibility apis is also very

942
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,320
important

943
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,720
web apis android apis and so on because

944
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,158
you know we can't make every program out

945
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,960
there like voice compatible we just have

946
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,159
to

947
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,159
meet in the middle where they interact

948
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,200
at the keyboard layer or the awesome

949
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,200
american has a question uh wonders if

950
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,720
these systems use similar approaches

951
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,960
like stenography

952
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,880
with mnemonics or if there's any

953
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,880
projects working having that in mind

954
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,439
a very good question so

955
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,679
the first thing everyone uses is the

956
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,039
nato phonetic alphabet to spell letters

957
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,559
for example

958
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:35,200
alpha bravo charlie some people

959
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,720
then will substitute letters for things

960
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,440
that are too long like november

961
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,320
i use noi sometimes the speech system

962
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,320
doesn't understand you

963
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,678
whenever i said alpha dragon was like oh

964
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,158
you're saying offer

965
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,360
so i changed it it's arch for me arch

966
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,880
brav char

967
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,719
um so and also

968
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,159
most of these grammars are in a common

969
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,440
grammar format they are written in

970
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,240
python and they're compatible with

971
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,559
dragonfly

972
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,320
so you can grab a grammar for i don't

973
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,678
know for a nia and get it to work with

974
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,080
county active grammar with very little

975
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,159
effort

976
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,279
i actually have a grammar that works on

977
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,120
both aenea

978
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,440
and kelly active grammar and that's what

979
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,439
i use

980
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,960
so there's a bit of lingua franca i

981
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,320
guess you can kind of guess what other

982
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,399
people are using but at the same time

983
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,279
there's a lot of customization you know

984
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,639
um because because people change words

985
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,559
they add their own commands

986
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,279
they change words based on what the

987
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:27,039
speech system understands ellie b

988
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,279
asks is there an online community you

989
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,000
can propose for accessibility

990
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,000
technologies

991
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
um there's a there's an amazing forum

992
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:42,959
for anything related to voice coding

993
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,559
all the developers of new voice coding

994
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,360
software are there

995
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,360
sorry to see a drink

996
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,239
so it's a really fantastic resource i do

997
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,799
link to it from

998
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,360
voxhub dot io i believe it's at the

999
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:01,200
bottom of the cali active grammar

1000
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,080
page so you can definitely check that

1001
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,240
out for general accessibility

1002
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,199
um i don't know i could recommend the

1003
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,639
accessibility

1004
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,480
mailing list at google but that's only

1005
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,960
if you work at google other than that

1006
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,000
um yeah i think it depends on your

1007
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,159
community right i

1008
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,679
i think if you're looking for web

1009
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,000
accessibility you could go for some

1010
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,839
mozilla mailing lists and so on if

1011
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,199
you're looking for desktop accessibility

1012
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,839
then maybe you could go find some stuff

1013
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:27,520
about uh the the windows

1014
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,279
speech api and the ones one last

1015
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,520
question from joe nielsen

1016
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,839
could there be legal issues if you make

1017
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:37,280
an e-book into

1018
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:37,279
audio i'm not sure what that refers to

1019
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,598
yeah so if you are like doing uh you

1020
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,760
if you're using a screen reader and you

1021
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,599
like you know try get it to read out the

1022
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:52,399
contents of a uh

1023
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,399
of an e-book right so

1024
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,040
most most of the time there are fair use

1025
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,480
exceptions for copyright law

1026
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,480
um even in the u.s and

1027
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,680
making a copy of yourself for for

1028
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,760
personal purposes

1029
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,118
so that you can access it is usually

1030
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,480
considered fair use

1031
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,839
um if you if you were trying to

1032
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,359
commercialize it or make money off of

1033
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,720
that or like

1034
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,720
i don't know you're a famous streamer

1035
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,000
and all you do is highlight text and

1036
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,000
have it read it out

1037
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,440
then maybe but i would say that that

1038
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,400
definitely falls under fair use

1039
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,599
all right so i guess that's it for the

1040
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,599
talk i think we're

1041
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,040
hitting the timing mark really well

1042
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,880
thank you so much david for
