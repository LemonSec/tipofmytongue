like

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,680

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,360

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,840
and liv who i'm going to use is the

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,839
shock

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,000
oh yeah so i've got to go to the shop

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,120
yeah

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,680
it's kind of a stress this year

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,480
we only had about 18 heralds for the

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,000
main talks

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,718
rc 1 and rc2 and we have introduced

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,959
about 51 talks with that

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,799
everybody from this home setup which was

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,199
a very very hard struggle

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,560
so we all had a metric ton of adrenaline

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,680
and excitement without

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,799
within us so here you can see what you

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,400
have seen

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:22,560
how harold looks from the font and

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,560
so it does look in the background

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,720
that was hard really hard for us so you

34
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,840
see all our different setups here

35
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,520
do we have and we are

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,000
very very pleased to also have set up a

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,439
completely new operation center the

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,119
herald news show

39
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,960
which i really really like you to review

40
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,320
on youtube

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,600
this was such a struggle and

42
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,240
we have about oh wait a second

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,360
so as we said we're a little bit

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,158
unprepared here

45
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,159
i need to have my notes up there were 20

46
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,079
members that formed a new team

47
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:07,360
on the first day they made 23 shows

48
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,720
10 hours of video recording 20 times the

49
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,959
pizza man wrong

50
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,840
at the door and 23 mata bottles had been

51
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,319
drunk

52
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,920
during the preps because all of those

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,119
people needed to be

54
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,000
online the complete time so

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,640

angelized yak

79
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,480
last year because we had a remote event

80
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,480
but we had a total of

81
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,879
1487

82
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,720
total angels from which

83
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:14,239
710 arrived

84
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:18,478
and even more of 300

85
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:21,519
angels that at least still

86
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,519
did one shift

87
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,639
and in total um the recorded work done

88
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,719
to that point was roughly

89
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:36,160
17 and 75

90
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:40,160
weeks of done working hours

91
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,440
and for the rc3 world

92
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,720
we also prepared a few

93
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,759
goodies so um people could come visit us

94
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,880
and so we

95
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:56,000
provided them a few badges

96
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,040
there and every

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,560
angel that um for example found

98
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,440
our extinguished expired extinguisher

99
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,360
and

100
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:11,240
also um extremely fire in heaven

101
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,680
the first batch was achieved from

102
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,080
232

103
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:21,520
of our angels and even

104
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,719
less but still a good number of 125

105
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,440
angels accomplished to help us

106
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,039
and extinguish the fire that broke out

107
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,719
during remed

108
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,120
and with with that numbers in in checked

109
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,880
we

110
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,639
also will jump into um our heaven

111
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,479
so i would like to show you some

112
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,000
expressions um

113
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:47,440
and impressions from it we we had um

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,960
quite the team working to

115
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,039
do exactly what the heaven could do

116
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,120
manage its people so we needed our

117
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,440
heaven office

118
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,639
and we also did this with respect to

119
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,000
your privacy so

120
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:05,120
um we painted our color

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,199
our clouds white as ever so

122
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,680
we cannot see your nicknames and you

123
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,560
could do your angel work but not be

124
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,600
bothered with us asking for your names

125
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,919
and

126
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:21,199
also we had prepared some

127
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,080
secret passage to our back office

128
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,880
and every time on on the real event it

129
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,479
would happen

130
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,880
that some adventurers

131
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,080
would find their way into our back

132
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,479
office and so

133
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,400
we needed to provide that opportunity as

134
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,318
well as you can see here

135
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:43,198
and let me say that some adventurers

136
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,639
tried to find the way in our sacred

137
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,919
digital back office

138
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,280
but only few were successful so

139
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:55,440
we hope everyone found its way back

140
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:59,198
into the real world from our labyrinth

141
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,880
and we also did not spare any expenses

142
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,919
to

143
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,360
do some additional update for

144
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:10,159
our angels as well um as you can see um

145
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,120
we we tried to do some multi-instance

146
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,360
support so

147
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,639
some of our angels also accomplished to

148
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,840
split up and serve

149
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:21,360
more than one angel at the time

150
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:25,198
and that was quite awesome and so

151
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,319
we tried to provide the same things we

152
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:32,080
would do on congress but now

153
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:35,360
from our remote offices and um

154
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:39,039
one last thing that

155
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:43,440
doesn't normally doesn't need to be said

156
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:47,360
but i i think um in this year and

157
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,400
with this different kind of event

158
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,639
i think it's necessary that um the

159
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,919
heaven as a representative

160
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,879
mostly for people trying to help make

161
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,120
this

162
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:04,479
event awesome i think it's it's time

163
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,680
to say the things we

164
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,479
do take for granted and that is thank

165
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,360
you

166
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,159
for all your help thank you for all the

167
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,440
entities

168
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:19,520
all the teams or the participants

169
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:22,800
um that achieved the goal

170
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,198
to bring our real congress that many

171
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
many

172
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,919
entities missed this year into a new

173
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,879
stage

174
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,599
we tried that online it had its up and

175
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,839
downs but

176
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,519
i think i still think it was an awesome

177
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,399
adventure for everyone

178
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,560
and um from the heaven team i can only

179

i hope to see you all again in the

181
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:49,439

on a real event bye and have a nice new

183
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
year

184
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,519
hello hello back again so uh

185
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,160
we now are switching over to the signal

186
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,160
angels

187
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,040
are the signal agents ready hello

188
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,920
yeah hello um welcome welcome to the

189
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,560
infrastructure review for the signal

190
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,399
angels

191
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,920
um i have prepared some stuff for you

192
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,440
uh this was for us slide please um this

193
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,719
was for us the first time

194
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,760
running a fully remote uh

195
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:46,480
q a session set i guess

196
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:50,000
we had some experience with the

197
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,320
dvoc and had gotten some help

198
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,320
from there on how to do this but uh just

199
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,040
to compare our usual procedure

200
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,720
is to um have a signal ranger in the

201
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,000
room they collect the question on their

202
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,839
laptop there

203
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,160
and they communicate with the herald on

204
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,320
stage and

205
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,000
they have a microphone like i'm wearing

206
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,120
a headset but in there we have a studio

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,040
microphone and we

208
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,360
speak questions into it um yeah but

209
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,279
remotely we really can't do that next

210
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,519
slide

211
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,360
because well it would be quite a quite a

212
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,880
lot of hassle for everyone to set up

213
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,880
good audio setup so

214
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,360
um we needed a new remote procedure so

215
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,720
we figured out that the signal angel and

216
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,120
the herald could

217
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,120
communicate with up by a pet and we

218
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,839
could also collect the question in there

219
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,959
and the herald will read the question to

220
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:44,000
the speaker and

221
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,000
collect feedback and stuff so we had a

222
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,440
1575

223
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,719
57 57

224
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,399
shifts and sadly we couldn't fill

225
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:01,839
five of them in the beginning because

226
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:04,640
there was not enough people already

227
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,640
there and yeah also technically it was

228
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,760
more than five unfilled shifts because

229
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,040
for some reasons

230
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:15,439
there were dj sets and other things that

231
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:18,240
aren't talks and also don't have q a

232
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,000
yeah we had 61 angels coordinated by

233
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,120
four supporters so me and three other

234
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,839
people

235
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,839
and we had a 60 additional angels that

236
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,399
in theory we wanted to do signal angel

237
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,920
work but

238
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,680
didn't show up to the introduction

239
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,880
meeting and uh

240
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,680
yeah next for

241
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,360
as i've said for each session uh each

242
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,239
talk we created a pad

243
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,360
where we put in the questions from irc

244
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,040
mastered on twitter

245
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:48,480
and where we have a bit more

246
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,120
pets than talks we actually handled and

247
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,680
i have some statistics about an

248
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,839
estimated number of questions per talk

249
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,399
what we usually assume is that there's a

250
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,000
question per line but

251
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,079
some questions are really long and have

252
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,560
to split over multiple lines there are

253
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,560
some

254
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,000
structured questions with headings and

255
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,160
paragraphs

256
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,360
some heralds or signal angels removed

257
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,399
questions after they were

258
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,800
done and also there was some chat and

259
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,800
other communication in there so next

260
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,719
slide

261
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,120
we took a python script download all the

262
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,720
pet contents read them counted lines

263
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,760
removed the size of the

264
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,920
static header and

265
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:34,560
in the end we had 179

266
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,880
pads and 1627

267
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,959
lines if we discount the static header

268
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,360
of nine lines per pad so

269
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,319
that in theory leads to about nine

270
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,480
questions

271
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,320
in quotation marks because it's not

272
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,440
really questions but lines but it's an

273
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:53,600
estimate

274
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:56,800
per talk uh thank you

275
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,480
talk and what i've learned is never miss

276
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:03,920
the introduction so the next

277
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,839
in line are the line producers

278
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,839
stb are you there

279
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:21,839
i am here in fact

280
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,790
[Music]

281
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,279
so the people a bit older might

282
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,119
recognize this melody badly sung by

283
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,399
yours truly and uh

284
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,360
other members of the uh line producers

285
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,440
team

286
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,120
um and i'll get to why that is relevant

287
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,320
to what we've been doing

288
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:53,279
at at this particular uh event

289
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,160
um so what does what do line producers

290
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,480
do what does

291
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,279
an auf number lighting actually perform

292
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,920
it's basically

293
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,439
communication between everybody's who is

294
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,639
involved in the production the people

295
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,440
behind the camera

296
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,920
and also in front of the camera and so

297
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,839
our work started really early

298
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,040
basically at the beginning of november

299
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,959
taking on

300
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,880
like prepping speakers in a technical

301
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,359
setup and rehearsing with them

302
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,160
a little bit and then enabling the

303
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,959
studios

304
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,680
to allow them to actually do the

305
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,319
production

306
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,000
coordinate on an organizational side the

307
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,079
technical side was handled by

308
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,519
the rock and will get to hear about that

309
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,120
in a minute

310
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:38,079
but getting uh all these people

311
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,160
synced up and working together well that

312
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,638
was quite a challenge and that took a

313
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,279
lot

314
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,360
lot of mumbles with a lot of people in

315
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,360
them

316
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:52,480
we only worked on the two main channels

317
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,880
there's quite a few more channels that

318
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,399
are run independently of kind of the

319
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,920
central organization

320
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,760
and again we'll get to hear about the

321
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,959
details of that in a minute

322
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,680
um and so we provided information

323
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,839
we try to fill wiki pages with relevant

324
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:13,439
information for everybody involved

325
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:15,199
so that was our main task

326
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,639
so what does that mean specifically the

327
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,160
production setup

328
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:23,199
uh we had 25 studios

329
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,240
um mainly in germany uh also one in

330
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,519
switzerland

331
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,560
um these uh did produce uh

332
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,600
recordings uh ahead of time for some

333
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,920
speakers

334
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,639
and many did live setups for their own

335
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,079
channels

336
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,160
and also for the two main channels

337
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,839
and i've listed everybody involved in

338
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,800
the live production here

339
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,279
um and there were 19 channels in total

340
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,000
um

341
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,880
so a lot of stuff happening 25 studios

342
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,279
19

343
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,560
channels that broadcast content produced

344
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,959
by these studios

345
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,439
so that's kind of the eurovision kind of

346
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,439
thing where you have different

347
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,240
studios producing content and trying to

348
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,399
mix it all together

349
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,480
again the voc took care of the technical

350
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,120
side of things very admirably

351
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,800
but getting everybody on the same page

352
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,759
to actually do this was not easy

353
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,040
for the talk program we had over 350

354
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,720
talks in total

355
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,360
53 in the main channels um and so

356
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,519
handling all that making sure everybody

357
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,000
has the speaker information they need

358
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:31,600
um and and all these organizational

359
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,600
stuff that was a lot of work

360
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,279
so we didn't have a studio for the main

361
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,320
channels

362
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,519
the 25 studios or the 90 the the live

363
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,560
channels the 12

364
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,720
they actually did provide the production

365
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,359
facilities for the speakers

366
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,720
so we can look at the next slide there's

367
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,440
a couple more numbers

368
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,920
and of course a couple pictures from us

369
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,000
working

370
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:59,120
basically from today we had 53 channel

371
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,079
53 talks in the main channel

372
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,040
18 of them were pre-recorded and played

373
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,319
out

374
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,720
we had three where people were actually

375
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,159
on location in a studio and gave their

376
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,280
talk from there

377
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,919
and uh we had 32 that were streamed live

378
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,280
like i am speaking to you now with

379
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,120
various technical bits

380
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,399
that again the walk will go into in a

381
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,159
minute

382
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,240
and we did a lot of q and a's i don't

383
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,720
have the number how many talks actually

384
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,760
had q and a's but most of them did

385
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,160
and those were always live

386
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,039
we had a total of 63 speakers we did

387
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,000
prepare

388
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,720
at least the live q and a session for

389
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,039
and helped them

390
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,600
set up we helped them record their talks

391
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,400
if they wanted to pre-record them

392
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,439
so we spent anywhere between one and two

393
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,200
hours

394
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,039
with every speaker to make sure they

395
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,600
would appear correctly and in good

396
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,160
quality on the screen

397
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,799
and then during the four days we of

398
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,480
course

399
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,799
helped coordinate between the master

400
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,760
control room and the 12 live studios to

401
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,440
make sure

402
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,039
that the speakers were where they were

403
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,120
supposed to be and any technical

404
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,320
glitches could be worked out and decide

405
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,719
on the spot

406
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,639
if for example the line producers made a

407
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,480
mistake and a talk couldn't happen

408
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,760
as we had planned because we forgot

409
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,320
something

410
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,679
so we rescheduled and found a new spot

411
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,520
for the speakers

412
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,960
so apologies again for that and thank

413
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,000
you for your understanding and

414
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,200
helping us uh bring you on screen

415
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,960
on day two and not day one but i i'm

416
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,400
very glad that that we could work that

417
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,880
out

418
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,000
and that's pretty much it uh from the

419
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,240
line producers

420
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,240
i think uh next up is the buck

421
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,520
thank you stb yes you're right the next

422
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,840
other vlog

423
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,918
and kunzi and jwac alex are waiting for

424
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,918
us

425
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:57,840
francie from the vlog 2020 was the year

426
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,120
hi this is francie from the

427
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,880
from buck 2020 was the year of

428
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,000
distributed conferences

429
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,039
we had two d-box and the frostcon

430
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,160
to learn how we are going to produce

431
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,520
remote talks

432
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,919
we learned a lot of stuff on

433
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,440
organization big blue button and jitsu

434
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,320
recording

435
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,080
we had a lot of other events which was

436
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,918
just streaming like business

437
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:31,360
as usual so for

438
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:34,960
rc3 we extended the streaming cdn with

439
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:38,159
two new locations now seven in tempo

440
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,280
with a total bandwidth of about

441
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:45,280
80 gigabits per second we have

442
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:48,240
two new mirrors for media cc cde

443
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,160
and are now also distributing the front

444
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,960
end

445
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,840
we got two new transcoder machines

446
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,880
alphas

447
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,399
enhanced setup we now have 10

448
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,240
alphas with the own productions on media

449
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,559
cctv

450
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:11,280
so the question is will it scale

451
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:14,399
on the next slide yep next slide

452
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,520
see that it

453
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,200
did scale we

454
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:24,320
did produce content for 25

455
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,120
studios and 19 channels

456
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,918
so we got a lot of lots of recordings

457
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,879
which will be published on media ccc in

458
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,000
the next

459
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:37,200
days and weeks some have already

460
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,799
been published so there's

461
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,520
a lot of content for you to watch and

462
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,840
now alex will tell us something about

463
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,000
the technical part

464
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,600
my name is alex for now it's it's i will

465
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,200
not tell you the technical part first

466
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,039
but more of the organization

467
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,480
i was between the rock and the line

468
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,879
producing team

469
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,799
and now a bit how it worked so we had

470
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,840
those two main main channels as you want

471
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,559
sa2

472
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,840
those channels have been produced by the

473
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,639
various studios

474
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,039
distributed around the whole country and

475
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,799
those

476
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,280
streams this is now the upper path in

477
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,600
the picture went to our interest relay

478
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,280
to the fam to the master control room in

479
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,760
illinois now there were a team of people

480
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,559
adding the translations making the mix

481
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,799
making the

482
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,000
mix down making records and then

483
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,080
publishing it back to

484
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,120
the swimming relays all the other

485
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,520
studios

486
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,120
produced two channels those channels

487
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,000
took also the signals from different

488
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,280
studios

489
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,480
make a mix down etc publish to our cdn

490
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,440
and relays

491
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,000
and we publish to the studio channels as

492
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,840
you can see

493
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,080
this is not the theoretical setup we had

494
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,559
in the last year in the present so

495
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,399
our next slide we can see what this

496
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,720
leads

497
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,919
lots of communication we had the line

498
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,960
producing team

499
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,280
we had some production in illinois now

500
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,120
that

501
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,960
has to be coordinated we have the

502
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,199
studios we have the local studio helping

503
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,159
angels we have some mumbles there some

504
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,480
richard here

505
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,360
some cdn people some web where something

506
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,080
happens

507
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,719
we have some documentation there should

508
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,240
be

509
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,000
and then we started to plot down the

510
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,600
communication paths next slide please

511
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,440
if you plotted all of them it really

512
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,120
looks like the world but this is

513
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,039
actually the world but sometimes it

514
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,959
feels like they're just getting lost in

515
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,158
different paths who you have to ask who

516
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,720
do you have to call

517
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,720
where are you what's the shortest path

518
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,200
to communicate

519
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,880
but let's have a look at the studios

520
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,679
first going to house west kunzi

521
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,039
yes on the next slide you will see the

522
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,559
studio set up at

523
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:44,480
chaos west tv so thank you chaos west

524
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,480
for producing your channel

525
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,678
at the next slide you see the wikipakka

526
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,679
television and fantasy stream in vtf

527
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,400
who have the internal motto absolutely

528
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,039
then the fake house of recording

529
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,039
but even then at some studios that you

530
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,799
look more like studios so

531
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,799
this time the next slide at the hack

532
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:11,918
yeah at hack you will also see

533
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,799
some of the bloopers we had to deal with

534
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,600
so for example here you can see there

535
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,039
was a cat

536
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:22,320
in the camera view so

537
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:25,840
yeah and alex

538
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,720
tell us about the open infrastructure of

539
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,039
it

540
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,080
the open infrastructure orbit show in

541
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,960
this picture you can see that it's

542
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,399
really artsy

543
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,679
how you can make a studio looking really

544
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,840
nice even if you're alone they're

545
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,000
feeling a bit confident a bit more

546
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,600
hackish

547
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
but you have also those normal

548
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,559
productions as a next slide that caused

549
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,559
your hamburg

550
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,840
yeah at carl's jr hamburg we had

551
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,760
two regular wok cases like you know from

552
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,360
all the other conferences

553
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:59,840
and they were producing uh

554
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:02,799
on-site in a regular studio setup

555
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,000
and last but not least we got some

556
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,918
impressions from

557
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,760
khao zoner tv as you can see here also

558
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,200
quite regular studio setup quite regular

559
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,600
no there was some

560
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,960
chrono views on going and this is we had

561
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,480
a lot of distancing

562
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,159
wearing masks all the stuff that

563
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,480
everyone can be is safe

564
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,520
but c3 yellow cedric will tell you

565
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,679
something else about

566
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,559
it but look let's look at the nice

567
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,840
things

568
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,918
for example the minor issue we

569
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,918
on the second day we were sitting there

570
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,320
looking at our nice graphana

571
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,960
oh we got a lot of more connections the

572
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,918
servers

573
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,440
increasing the first question was have

574
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,159
we enabled our cache

575
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,440
we don't know but the number of

576
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,520
connections growing

577
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,440
then people are watching our streams the

578
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,559
interest goes up and we were

579
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,240
well at least the people are watching

580
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,480
the streams if there's also

581
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,279
it's a website on the website who cares

582
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,240
the interest

583
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,440
works but then we suddenly get a

584
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,840
relations

585
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,640
well something did not really scale that

586
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,559
good

587
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,039
and then you see the next slide the

588
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,039
issue

589
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,200
we switched pretty fast from after

590
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,000
looking at this traffic graph

591
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,360
well that's interesting into well we

592
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,200
should investigate

593
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,120
we get thousands of messages on twitter

594
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,440
dms we get thousands of messages in

595
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,279
rocketshed isc and suddenly

596
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,720
we had a lot of connections to handle a

597
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,559
lot of inquiries to handle

598
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,240
and that of phone calls et cetera to

599
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,678
handle and they have to prioritize

600
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,960
first the hardware then the

601
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,640
communication because otherwise the

602
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,840
application won't stop

603
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,880
on the next slide you can see what our

604
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,959
minor issue was so

605
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,400
at first we get a lot of connection so a

606
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,559
streaming web pages

607
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,480
then to a load balancers and finally to

608
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,320
our dns servers

609
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,720
a lot of them were quite malformed it

610
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,200
looked like a storm

611
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,200
but the more important thing we had to

612
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,159
deal with all those passive aggressive

613
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,240
messages from the

614
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,679
from people from different persons who

615
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,279
say well

616
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,360
you can't even handle streaming what are

617
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,080
you doing here and we're working

618
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,240
together

619
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,158
see for infra team thanks that how to

620
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,840
scale decent price even more just to

621
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,559
provide the people the connection power

622
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,559
they need

623
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,840
so i think in accordance with last

624
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,120
year's

625
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,879
we we don't need use more bandwidth we

626
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,918
should we can provide even more branded

627
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,919
bandwidth if we need it

628
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,760
and then now keying everything down

629
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:35,120
so is it time to shut everything down

630
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:38,720
no we won't shut everything down

631
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,879
um the studios can keep their end points

632
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,559
can continue to stream on their

633
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,120
endpoints

634
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,678
as they wish we want to keep in touch

635
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,479
with you

636
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,360
in the studios produce content with you

637
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,720
improve our

638
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:56,639
software stack improve other

639
00:26:52,720 --> 00:27:00,320
things like the isdn the internet

640
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:04,080
streaming digital node the project

641
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,879
for small camera recording setups

642
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,360
for sending two speakers needs

643
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,400
developers for the software

644
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,439
also kevin needs developers

645
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:18,880
and testers what's

646
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:22,159
kevin oh we have prepared another slide

647
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:26,720
of the next slide kevin is short for

648
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:29,760
killer experimental video internet noise

649
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:33,279
because we initially wanted to use

650
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,039
obs ninja but there are a couple of

651
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:38,559
licensing issues there

652
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:41,200
is not everything available obs ninja

653
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,399
is open source like we wanted so we

654
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,760
decided

655
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:48,879
to uh code our own

656
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,240
obs ninja style software so

657
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:55,760
if you are interested in doing so

658
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:59,520
please get into contact with us or visit

659
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:05,440
the wiki so that's all from the walk

660
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:05,440
and we are now heading over to c3 lingo

661
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:17,840
exactly c3 lingo oscar

662
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:17,840
should be waiting in studio 2 aren't you

663
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:30,480
yeah hello um

664
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,760
hi uh yeah i'm oscar from c3 lingo

665
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,799
we will jump straight into this into the

666
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,600
stats

667
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,600
on our slides

668
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,240
as you can see here we translated 138

669
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,360
talks

670
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,520
this time as you can see it's also

671
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,279
way less languages than in the other

672
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,720
chaos events that we had

673
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,159
since our second languages team that

674
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,799
does everything that is not english and

675
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,440
german

676
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,360
was only five people strong this time so

677
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,080
we only managed to do five talks into

678
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,439
french and

679
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:10,158
three talks into brazilian portuguese

680
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:13,120
and then on the next slide we

681
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,480
are looking at our coverage uh for the

682
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,639
talks and we can see that

683
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,320
on the main talks we managed to cover

684
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,240
all talks that were happening

685
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,520
uh from english to german and german to

686
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,000
english

687
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,399
depending on what the south language was

688
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,600
and then on

689
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:32,639
the other languages track um we

690
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,480
only managed to do 15 of the talks

691
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,840
from the main channels and then on the

692
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,080
further channels which is

693
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,760
a couple of others that also were

694
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,080
provided to us in the translation team

695
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,240
we

696
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:46,320
managed to do 68 percent of the talks

697
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,279
but none of them were there were

698
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,639
translated into

699
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:53,760
other languages than english and german

700
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:57,120
on the next slide uh some

701
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,080
global stats we had 36 interpreters

702
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,000
which in total managed to translate 106

703
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,439
hours and seven minutes of talks

704
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,080
into another language simultaneously

705
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,840
and the maximum number of hours one

706
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,240
person did was 16 hours

707
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,000
and the minimum number of hours the the

708
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,159
average number of hours

709
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,919
people did was around three hours of

710
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,919
translation across the entire event

711
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,199
all right then i also have some

712
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,918
anecdotes to tell

713
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,440
um and some some mentions i want to do

714
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,480
we had two new interpreters that we want

715
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,520
to say hi to

716
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,880
um we had a couple of issues with

717
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,039
the digital thing that we didn't have

718
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,799
before with regular events where

719
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,279
people were present for example the

720
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,080
issue of uh sometimes when two people

721
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,880
are translating

722
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,320
um one person starts to interpret

723
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,000
something on a wrong stream

724
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,678
maybe they were watching watching the

725
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,600
wrong one and then the partner just

726
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,720
thinks they have more delay or something

727
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,320
or for example

728
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,919
a partner having a smaller delay and

729
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,879
then thinking that the partner can

730
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,480
suddenly reach my

731
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,240
read minds because they can translate

732
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,360
faster than the other person is actually

733
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,880
seeing the stream

734
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,559
those are issues that we usually didn't

735
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,600
have with the

736
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:10,240
regular stream but only with

737
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,519
with the regular events not with remote

738
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,399
events

739
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,399
and yeah some some hurdles to overcome

740
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,600
another thing was for example on when on

741
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,720
the r3s stage the audio cut out uh

742
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,039
sometimes first

743
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,799
and uh but because one of our

744
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,600
translators had also already translated

745
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,639
the talk twice

746
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,399
at least partially to uh because and it

747
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,080
was already canceled after those

748
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,239
uh they basically knew most of the

749
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,199
content could basic to do a powerpoint

750
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,399
karaoke

751
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,240
translation and um was able to

752
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:45,279
do most of the talk uh just from the

753
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,640
slides without any audio

754
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:52,000
um yeah and then

755
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,600
there there also was um

756
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,120
uh yeah the last thing i want to say is

757
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,959
actually i want to say

758
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,399
give a big shout out to the two of our

759
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,000
team members that

760
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,518
weren't able to interpret with us this

761
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,039
time because they put their heart and

762
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,480
soul into this event happening and

763
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,960
that's stb and cutty

764
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:15,840
and that's basically everything from c3

765
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:15,840
ango thanks

766
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,399

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,480
to its slides you already saw a minute

770
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,480
ago

771
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,158
okay

772
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,158
okay hi so i'm td from the c3 subtitles

773
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,439
team and

774
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,880
next slide please uh so just to quickly

775
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,640
let you know how we get from the

776
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,960
recorded talks to

777
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,640
the release subtitles where we take the

778
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,120
the recording videos and

779
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,200
apply speech recognition software to get

780
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,559
a raw transcript and then angels work on

781
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,320
that transcript to correct all the

782
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,600
mistakes that the speech recognition

783
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,360
software makes

784
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,600
and we again apply some auto timing

785
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,399
magic to to get some raw subtitles

786
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,760
and then again angels do quality control

787
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,439
on these tracks to

788
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,760
get release subtitles next slide please

789
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,279
so as you can see we have various

790
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,840
subtitle tracks in in

791
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,399
different stages of completion and these

792
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,959
are

793
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,719
seconds of material that we have you can

794
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,399
see all the numbers are going up and to

795
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,159
the right as they should be

796
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:41,039
so next slide please um

797
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,960
in total we had 68 distinct angels that

798
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,200
worked four shifts on average

799
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,240
83 percent of our angels returned for a

800
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,559
second shift

801
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,440
10 of our angels worked 12 or more

802
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:53,039
shifts

803
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:56,480
and in some we had 382 hours

804
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:59,600
of angel work for 47 hours of material

805
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,880
so far we've had two releases for rc3

806
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,639
and hopefully more yet to come and 37

807
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,559
releases for all the congresses mostly

808
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,200
on the first few days where we

809
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,520
didn't have many recordings we have 41

810
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,759
hours still in the transcribing stage

811
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,839
of material 26 hours of material in the

812
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,800
timing stage and 51 hours

813
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,639
material in the quality control stage so

814
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,440
there's still lots of work to be done

815
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,040
next slide please um when you have

816
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,119
transcripts you can do fun stuff with

817
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,119
them for example you can see that

818
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,399
important to people in this talk are

819
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,079
people

820
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,560
we're working on other cool features

821
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:37,679
that are yet to come stay tuned for that

822
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,320
next slide please so to keep track of

823
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,399
all these tasks uh we've been using

824
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,639
a state-of-the-art high performance log

825
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:47,440
free nosql columnar data store

826
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,119
aka a cardboard in the previous years

827
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,560
and because we don't have any windows in

828
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,560
the ccl building anymore

829
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,320
we had to virtualize that so we're using

830
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,399
kanban software now

831
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,839
um at this point i would like to thank

832
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,640

about 195 five

862
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,920
5195 extensions

863
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,320
which is about 500 more than you

864
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,920
registered on the last congress

865
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:37,920
um also you did about

866
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,839
21 000 calls a little bit less than on

867
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,720
the last congress but

868
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,279
yeah we are still quite proud of what

869
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,598
you have

870
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,079
used our system with and yeah it run

871
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:50,400
quite stable and yeah

872
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,760
as you may notice on the bottom we also

873
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,040
had about

874
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,520
23 dect antennas at the congress or at

875
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,599
this

876
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,599
event so please switch to the next slide

877
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,520
and this is our new feature it's it's

878
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,320
called the

879
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,640
next slide it is called the event phone

880
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,880
decentralized decked infrastructure

881
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,200
which we especially prepared for this

882
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,240
event um the app ddi

883
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:21,359
so we had about 23 rfps online

884
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:25,439
throughout germany with

885
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:29,279
68 um telephones registered to it

886
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,680
um but it's not only the um

887
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,200
the german part that we covered we

888
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,560
actually had one mobile

889
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,879
station walking out uh through austria

890
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,839
through paso i think so

891
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,440
indeed we had an european eventful index

892
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:50,078
uh decentralized

893
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:52,560
infrastructure um next slide please

894
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,800
we also have some anecdotes so maybe

895
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,680
some of you have noticed that we had a

896
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,560
public phone

897
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,720
a working public phone in the rc world

898
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,078
where you could call other people on the

899
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,640
telephone system and also

900
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,200
other people started to play with our

901
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,480
system

902
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:14,160
and uh i think about yesterday um

903
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:17,599
someone started to introduce the c3 fire

904
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,598
so you could um actually control a

905
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,599
flamethrower through our telephone

906
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,800
system

907
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,680
and i like to present here video next

908
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,640
slide please

909
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,640
maybe you can play it

910
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,920
i have quite a delay in waiting for the

911
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,480
video to play

912
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,599
so what you can see here is um the c3

913
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,880
fire system

914
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:45,119
um actually controlled by a deck

915
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:50,000
telephone somewhere in germany

916
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,000
so next slide please

917
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:59,040
we we also provided you with sstv

918
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:02,320
servers um via the phone number

919
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,160

um like a postcard basically so

923
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,599
basically you could call the number

924
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:16,640
and receive a picture or some other

925
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,640

i'm from the gsm team and this year was

937
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,000
quite

938
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,040
different as you can imagine um however

939
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,839
um next slide please so

940
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,839
um but we managed to get a small network

941
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:12,160
running

942
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:13,599
um and also a couple of sim cards which

943
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,960
is string

944
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:20,079
um so where are we now so

945
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,800
next slide please as you can see

946
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,720
we are just there in the red dot there's

947
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,160
not even a single line for our five

948
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,879
extensions

949
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,640
but even we manage 130 calls over five

950
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,400
extensions

951
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,400
and next slide please

952
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:41,759
so we got um

953
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,720
so we got five extensions um

954
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,240
registered with four sim cards and three

955
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,598
locations

956
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,640
uh with mixed technologies also two

957
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,440
users so far

958
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,440
thirdly and one network with more or

959
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,960
less zero problems

960
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:03,359
um so let's take a look on the coverage

961
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:05,440
so next slide please um so we

962
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:07,279
we are quite lucky that we managed to

963
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,880
get an international

964
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,680
network running so we got two um

965
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,520
two base stations uh in berlin one in

966
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,480
the hackerspace nafta and another one

967
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,560
north of berlin

968
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:23,200
and uh yeah one one of our members is

969
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,920
currently in mexico and uh yeah he's

970
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,279
providing

971
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:31,760
uh the the remote chaos

972
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:34,480
uh networks there um

973
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,319
yeah so um that's basically our network

974
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,200
um

975
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:40,480

10 to 20 and had some fun with

982
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,598
uh improving our network and preparing

983
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,800
for

984
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:02,160

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,200
doing the slide dj all the time and

996
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,319
he needs to switch to the hex and who

997
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,960
are next

998
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:45,839
um they bring an image and meltzer is

999
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:45,839
waiting for us in studio three

1000
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,118
hello what's phones without people so

1001
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,880
i'll give you now an introduction and

1002
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,440
over here how many people we needed to

1003
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,000
run the whole hexane assembly

1004
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,400
we had around 20 organizing hacksan and

1005
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,599
we had around 20 speaker in our wins

1006
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,800
and we had in total around 40 events but

1007
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,920
i'm pretty sure that i

1008
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,760
even don't know all of these as you

1009
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,560
as you've realized award is pretty large

1010
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,599
so we needed around 7 million pixels

1011
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,680
to display the whole hudson world

1012
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,040
and that needed around 400 commits on

1013
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,640
that on our github

1014
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,640
corner of the internet

1015
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,960
around 130 people received the fireplace

1016
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,040
better in our case

1017
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,680
and around 100 people tested our

1018
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:34,160
swimming pool and received that back so

1019
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,359
great a year for not going religious

1020
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,560
wedding

1021
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:41,359
also around 449 people

1022
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,520
showed some very deep dedication and

1023
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,640
checked out all memorials in our hexane

1024
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,240
assembly

1025
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,240
congratulations for that there were

1026
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,720
quite a many of these ones

1027
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,839
our events run our big blue button

1028
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,680
actually from the

1029
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,440
from the congress and so we had starting

1030
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,480
from day zero no legs

1031
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,000
and were able to host up to 133 people

1032
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,319
in one session

1033
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,040
and that was quite stable we also

1034
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,960
introduced

1035
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,960
found new members around 13 new hacks

1036
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,400
and joined just for the congress

1037
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,560
and we increased now to the size of 440

1038
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,880
hacks in overall

1039
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,799
also somewhat uh we got new to the

1040
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,880
accounts following us so we have added

1041
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:24,160
over 200 more twitter accounts and so

1042
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,920
our messages are getting hurt but

1043
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,839
besides the ritual world we also did

1044
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,079
some quite physical things first of all

1045
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,799
we distributed over 50 physical

1046
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,920
uh goody bags to the people with

1047
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,000
microcontrollers and set of

1048
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,520
series masks in it as you can see on the

1049
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,040
picture and also

1050
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:43,119
sadly we shop so many rc3 hexanz

1051
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,680

1052

1058
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,640
partnering team we've been welcoming

1059

we've been welcoming new attendees and

1060
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,598

community

1062
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,480
for over eight years we match up our

1063
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,920
mentees with experienced chaos mentors

1064
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,800
these mentors help their mentees

1065
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,880
navigate our world of chaos events

1066
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,160
dvac was our first remote event and it

1067
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,760
was a good proof of concept for rc3 this

1068
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:37,200
year we had 65

1069

and a wonderful world map assembly built

1074
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:53,040

1075
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:56,319
37 kilograms of multi-color pixels

1087
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,759

so next up we'll have the

1089

and we will talk about the c3 adventure

1093
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,800
the 2d world

1094
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,920
and what we did to bring it all online

1095
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,920
next slide please

1096
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:11,440
okay so when we started out

1097
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:14,799
we uh looked into

1098
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,240
how we could uh bring a congress-like

1099
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,280
adventure to

1100
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:22,000
uh the uh remote experience

1101
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,040
and on uh october we started with the

1102
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,400
development

1103
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:29,839
and we

1104
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,960
had some trouble in that we had multiple

1105
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:34,078
upstream mergers

1106
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,720
that gave us some problems and also

1107
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,240
due to just congress being congress or

1108
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,359
remote experience being remote

1109
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:42,879
experienced

1110
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:46,000
we needed to introduce features

1111
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:49,440
a bit late or add features on

1112
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,640
uh the first day so auth was merged

1113
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:56,160
just and 4 30 p.m a.m

1114
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,640
in the first day and um on the second

1115
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,279
day

1116
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,558
we finally fixed the instance jumps you

1117
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,280
know when you

1118
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,480
walk from one map to the next we had

1119
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,119
some problems there

1120
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,079
but on the second day it all went up and

1121
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:11,440
i hope you have

1122
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:13,440
all enjoyed the badges

1123
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,760
that have finally been updated and

1124
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:19,280
brought into the world today

1125
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:22,720
what does that all mean since we started

1126
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:26,240
implementing there have been 400

1127
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:28,240
git commits in our repository all in all

1128
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,680
including the upstream mergers but i

1129
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:33,040
think the more interesting

1130
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:36,240
stuff is what has been done

1131
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:39,920
since the whole thing went live we had

1132
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:43,118
200 additional commits fixing stuff

1133
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:46,880
and making the experience better for you

1134
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:50,079
next slide in order

1135
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:52,559
to bring this all online

1136
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,680
we not only had to think about the

1137
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,119
product itself

1138
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,598
not the only thing about the world

1139
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,040
itself but we also had to think about

1140
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,680
the deployment

1141
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,960
um the first commit on the deployer it's

1142
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,078
a bad current service

1143
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,200
that brings the experience to you has

1144
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,559
been done on

1145
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,279
26th of november we started the first

1146
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,960
instance

1147
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,599
the first clone of the work adventure

1148
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,079
through this deployer on 8th of december

1149
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,200
and

1150
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:23,760
a couple of days beforehand i

1151
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,359
was getting a bit swamped i couldn't do

1152
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,400
all of the work anymore because i had to

1153
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:29,520
coordinate both

1154
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,240
of the projects and so my colleague took

1155
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,079
over for me

1156
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,558
and helped me out a lot so i'll give

1157
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:37,839
over to him to explain what he did

1158
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:41,280
yeah so imagine that that on

1159
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:41,759
day minus five i get a message from a

1160
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,960
friend

1161
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:49,520
that hey help is needed

1162
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,520
so i say okay let's do it and

1163
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:55,520
rank tells me uh that's okay so we can

1164
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,119
spawn an instance and we need to scale

1165
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:00,880
it somehow and

1166
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:04,000
that and i spawned the deployer and

1167
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,040
my music stops i streamed music from the

1168
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,839
internet and

1169
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,960
i i wonder why did it stop and i have

1170
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:12,319
noticed that

1171
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:15,520
oh there are a lot of logs now like

1172
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:17,759
a lot and i have finally on dime

1173
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,559
day minus four notice that um the

1174
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,760
deployer was

1175
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:26,480
spawning its copies of itself

1176
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:27,680
each few seconds in a loop so that was

1177
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,800
the state back then

1178
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,440
uh since day minus four until day one we

1179
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:36,160
have

1180
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:40,559
basically written the thing and

1181
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:43,759
at well day one

1182
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:46,800
we were ready well almost ready i mean

1183
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,920
uh we have like four instances deployed

1184
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,400
and i forgot to mention that when we

1185
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,800
were

1186
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:58,000
about to deploy 200 once at once

1187
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:00,240
it wouldn't work because all all of the

1188
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,440
things would time out

1189
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:06,879
so we patched things quickly

1190
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,960
and 13 o'clock we've had our first

1191
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:13,119
deployments this

1192
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:17,200
worked and everything was fine and

1193
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:21,280
wait why is everyone on one instance

1194
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:24,000
so it turns out that we've had a bag

1195
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,720
not in the desert in the app that would

1196
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,160
move you

1197
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:30,959
from the lobby to the lobby

1198
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,759
on a different map so during the first

1199
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,520
day we have

1200
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,800
we've had a lot of issues of people not

1201
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,559
seeing each other

1202
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,359
because they were all on different

1203
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:43,599
instances of of the lobby

1204
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:46,870
so we were working hard and

1205
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,720
next slide please so we can see that

1206
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:52,078
[Music]

1207
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,279
we're working hard to reconfigure that

1208
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,480
to

1209
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:59,359
bring you together in the assemblies i

1210
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,520
think we have succeeded

1211
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,799
you can see the population graph on this

1212
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,839
slide

1213
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,559
the first day was uh our almost most

1214
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:10,240
popular

1215
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:12,480
uh one and uh the next day it would

1216
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,399
seem that okay it's not as popular but

1217
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:18,880
we have hit the peak of

1218
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:23,280
uh 1 000 x and 600 users

1219
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,280
that day uh

1220
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:29,680
what else about this the most popular

1221
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,880
instance was the lobby of course the

1222
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,520
second most popular

1223
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,480
instance was hardware hacking career for

1224
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:38,319
a while

1225
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:42,960
then the third i think

1226
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:46,558
next like this we have

1227
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,000
counted well first of all we have we've

1228
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:53,200
had

1229
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:55,119
in total about 205 assemblies

1230
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,720
the number was increasing day by day

1231
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,280
because people through the whole

1232
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,720
congress they were working on their maps

1233
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:05,599
for a while certs had

1234
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,040
over a thousand maps active in their

1235
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,720
assembly

1236
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:13,200
which led to the map server crashing

1237
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:17,279
some of you might have noticed that

1238
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:19,279
it stopped working quite a few times

1239
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,400
during day three and they have reduced

1240
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:26,480
the number of maps to

1241
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:26,480
255 and that was fine

1242
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,960
at the end of day three i have counted

1243
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,880
about

1244
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:38,640
628 uh 28 maps

1245
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:42,319
uh this is less than is

1246
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,839
that was a base available in reality

1247
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,680
because i

1248
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:46,880
you know it was the middle of the night

1249
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,640
as always

1250
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,520
and uh it was it wasn't legal to count

1251
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,640
them

1252
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:57,520
but uh in the maps i have found we have

1253
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,799
found over 2 million used tires so

1254
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,480
that's something you can

1255
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:07,359
really explore i wish i could have

1256
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:07,359
but deploying this was also fun

1257
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:14,400
next slide this and what

1258
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:17,040
yeah just a quick interject

1259
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,720
i really want to thank everyone that has

1260
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:22,000
put work into their maps

1261
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:24,558
and made this whole experience work we

1262
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,280
we provided the infrastructure but you

1263
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,359
provided

1264
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,960
the fun and so i really want to thank

1265
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:31,040
everyone

1266
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,079
yeah the more things happen on the

1267
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,119
infrastructure

1268
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:36,400
the more fun we have we especially don't

1269
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:40,160
like to sleep

1270
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:43,599
so we didn't uh i basically

1271
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:46,960
uh exchanged with wrong the way that

1272
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:50,000
i slept five hours

1273
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,119
during the night and he slept five hours

1274
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,559
during the day

1275
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:57,040
and the rest of time we were up

1276
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,319
the record though is incorrect rank is

1277
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:01,759
now 30 hours

1278
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:06,240
up straight because the badges

1279
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:09,760
were too important to bring to you

1280
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:13,520
to go to sleep the thing you see on this

1281
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:16,799
graph is undeployed instances

1282
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:18,960
we were redeploying things constantly

1283
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:20,000
usually in the form of redeploying half

1284
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,040
of the infrastructure

1285
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,720
at any given time and the way it was

1286
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,319
developed you wouldn't have noticed that

1287
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,959
you wouldn't be kicked off

1288
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:30,319
your instances but for a brief period of

1289
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,839
time you wouldn't be an

1290
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:35,200
enter you wouldn't be able to enter

1291
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:38,960
anyone

1292
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:41,680
but next slide

1293
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,280
i have been talking for a few days of

1294
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:47,200
the congress that i have been

1295
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,960
implementing so the kubernetes

1296
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,799
thing because it's automatically

1297
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,720
deployed things and manage things and so

1298
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:56,079
on and

1299
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:58,319
i have noticed by day three that i have

1300
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:00,079
achieved through enlightenment and

1301
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:03,119
through automation

1302
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:05,760
because we have decided

1303
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,400
to deploy everything at once at some

1304
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,599
point

1305
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,839
the reason was that we are being

1306
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:14,480
ddosed and we had to change something to

1307
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:18,400
mitigate that

1308
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:22,640
and so we uh we did that and

1309
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:24,480
everything was fine but we made a typo

1310
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,920
we made the typo and the deployment

1311
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,960
failed and once

1312
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,280
the deployment failed and deleted all

1313
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:36,799
the servers

1314
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:40,640
so uh yeah 405 servers got deleted

1315
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:44,640
by uh what i'm remembering

1316
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:47,598
uh was a single line so it's uh

1317
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,879
was brought up automatically and uh that

1318
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:52,720
wasn't a problem

1319
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:54,880
it was all fine but uh well

1320
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,839
where is human to automate me safe is

1321
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,030
devops

1322
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:59,279
next slide

1323
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:02,319
[Music]

1324
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:04,160
what's important is that this 405

1325
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:06,240
servers was provided but

1326
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,759
by hessner we couldn't have done that

1327
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,118
without

1328
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,890
their infrastructure without their

1329
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,200
clouds

1330
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:14,160
[Music]

1331
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,040
the reason we got up so quickly after uh

1332
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,879
this was that

1333
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,558
the servers were deleted but they could

1334
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:22,079
have been reprovisioned

1335
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:26,319
uh almost instantly so the whole thing

1336
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:29,599
took like 10 minutes to get back up and

1337
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:31,440
next slide that's all thank you for

1338
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:34,319
allow testing our infrastructure

1339
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,319
and see you next year

1340
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:44,960
thank you c3 adventure so

1341
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,359
um this was clearly the first conference

1342
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,359
where

1343
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:49,440
that didn't clap for falling martyr

1344
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:51,520
bottles

1345
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,200
if that's not the thing may we try next

1346
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,240
year

1347
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:59,520
um the lounge and i now have to

1348
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,520
ask for the next slide too

1349
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:07,520
the rc3 lounge artist and i was asked

1350
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,160
to read every country where someone is

1351
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,040
in

1352
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,000

1387
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:31,279

1389

of course um

1439
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:42,400

total requests per second we're about

1444
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:53,200
400

1445
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:55,680
in the night when the world was

1446
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,960
redeploying then we only had to about 50

1447
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,799
recurse per second

1448
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,799
but it maxed up to 700

1449
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,799
records per second and the

1450
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:08,520
authentication for the world

1451
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:11,599
for the 2d adventure um it was about

1452
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:14,960
220 requests per second

1453
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:17,520
more or less stable um due to some bugs

1454
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:20,640
and due to some heavy usage so

1455

01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,559
this year

1465
01:03:55,839 --> 01:04:03,839
hi i'm betadaz from c3rt

1466
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:06,160
and we've been really busy this year

1467
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:07,200
as you can probably see by the numbers

1468
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:11,440
on my

1469
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:15,200
next slide we have

1470
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:20,559
37 confirmed arty angels

1471
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:24,399
and today we surpassed the 200 hours

1472
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:27,039
mark we have we've had 10 organ numbers

1473
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,760
leading up to the event and there are

1474
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:30,160
almost

1475
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,400
5 million unique pixels in our

1476
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:35,038
repository

1477
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,280
um i'm pretty convinced we've managed to

1478
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:40,480
create the smartest fairy dust

1479
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:41,680
of rc3 provided by an actual space

1480
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,720
engineer

1481
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:47,520
and the tree of solitude

1482
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:48,078
is not the only thing we've managed to

1483
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:51,920
create

1484
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:55,920
contributes to this wonderful experience

1485
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:59,760
on our next slide you can see

1486
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:02,480
that we also contributed

1487
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,720
six panel sessions for autistic

1488
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:08,000
creatures to discuss their

1489
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:11,038
experiences and five playstations

1490
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,039
for them to socialize

1491
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:18,160
we helped to contribute

1492
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:21,599
a talk a podcast and an external panel

1493
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,240
to the big streams and on our own panels

1494
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:25,520
we've had

1495
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:28,160
up to 80 participants

1496
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:30,160
that needed to be split up to five

1497
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,399
breakout rooms

1498
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,920
so they could all have a meaningful

1499
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:37,520
discussion

1500
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:40,640
and all their ideas and thoughts

1501
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:43,680
were eliminated

1502
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:47,038
and score is stored on

1503
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:50,160
more than 1000 lines of markdown

1504
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:51,440
documentation that you can find on the

1505
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:55,598
internet

1506
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:57,520
but 1 000 lines of markdown wouldn't be

1507
01:05:55,599 --> 01:06:00,720
enough for me to

1508
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,280
express the gratitude i have towards all

1509
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:04,399
the

1510
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:07,520
amazing creatures that helped

1511
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:10,640
us make this experience happen

1512
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:12,240
and for all the amazing teams that work

1513
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:15,359
with us

1514
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:19,038
i'm so happy to see you again soon

1515
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:22,319
but now i think i will need some

1516
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:22,319
solitude for myself

1517
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:31,280

a video as far as i know

1520
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:50,000
it's from the c3 exploration center

1521
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:53,520
i don't know the short name c3io walk

1522
01:06:50,000 --> 01:07:01,839
and i'm just counting down three two

1523
01:06:53,520 --> 01:07:01,839
run go

1524
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:24,640
so video is like a very difficult thing

1525
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:28,240
to play in those days because we

1526
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:30,480
only used to do stuff live

1527
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:32,799
means that a lot of pixels and traffic

1528
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:36,799
is done from this year from

1529
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:37,599
this glass to all the wires and cables

1530
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:39,920
and back

1531
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,640
to the glass of your screen and this is

1532
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,400
like

1533
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:48,319
magic to me somehow although i am only

1534
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:50,240
being a robot to talk synchronously with

1535
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:52,640
all the head deck okay no it's been

1536
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:56,720
already enough time

1537
01:07:52,640 --> 01:08:00,000
i think um

1538
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:02,720
to switch back to lindy

1539
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,720
with the video

1540
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:11,839
oh i tell you what we're going to

1541
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:17,359
the event for everyone and especially

1542
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:20,799
people with

1543
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:22,799
hello everyone i'm nwng from the new c3

1544
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:24,238
inclusion operations center

1545
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:25,920
this year we've been working on

1546
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:27,120
accessibility guides to help the

1547
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,120
organizing teams

1548
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:31,198
and assemblies improve the event for

1549
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,640
everyone and especially people with

1550
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:34,238
disabilities

1551
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,000
we have also worked with other teams

1552
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:37,040
individually to figure out what can

1553
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,279
still be improved

1554
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:41,759
in their specific range of functions but

1555
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:43,520
there is still a lot to catch up on

1556
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:46,000
additionally we have published a

1557
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:48,080
completely free and accessible css

1558
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,640
design template that features dark mode

1559
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:52,960
and an accessible font selection and it

1560
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:56,000
still looks good without javascript

1561
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,799
100 internet points for that for you

1562

hard drive maybe you remember

1580
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,439
this from the very beginning it has to

1581
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:54,000
be disinfected

1582
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:55,759
really thoroughly and um i guess i can

1583
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,080
take it out by the end of the event

1584
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,880
and for the next slide with the words

1585
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:03,840
please

1586
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:06,960
um we did uh found roughly 777

1587
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:11,040
um hands wash options and

1588
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:13,760
three ff waste disposal possibilities

1589
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:16,560
we checked the correct date on almost

1590
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:20,560
all of the 170

1591
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:21,120
disinfectant um options you had around

1592
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:23,440
here

1593
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:25,280
and because at a certain point of time

1594
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:27,360
people from third were not

1595
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,719
reachable in the third room because they

1596
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,080
were running around everywhere else in

1597
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:32,000
this great 2d world

1598
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,600
we had the chance to bypass and channel

1599
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,640
all the information because there were

1600
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,120
two digital cats

1601
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,000
on a digital tree and so we got the

1602
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:41,360
right help

1603
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:44,080
to the right option next slide please

1604
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,960
um we have a couple of options ongoing a

1605
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,920
lot of work had

1606
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,400
been done before we had all the studios

1607
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,960
with

1608
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:52,159
all the corona things going on before

1609
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,440
but now we think

1610
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:58,000
um we should really watch into an

1611
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,799
angel disinfectant swimming basin for

1612
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,600
the next time

1613
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,480
to have there the maximum option of

1614
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,080
cleanliness

1615
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:09,199
and we will talk with the book if we can

1616
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:11,840
maybe achieve to use this globally

1617
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:12,480
maxi cubes for the chunk in the upcoming

1618

01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:52,159
issues delivering to the online at the

1686
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,559
first two days

1687
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:57,040
but we managed to get that fixed a

1688
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:59,040
different mail provider refused our mail

1689
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:02,400
because it contained the string

1690
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:05,519
c3 world the domain in

1691
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,400
the mail text and apparently new domains

1692
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,239
are scary and

1693
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:10,000
you can't trust them or something and we

1694
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,639
created the ticket with them they fix it

1695
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
and it

1696
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:17,199
was super fast super nice service uh yet

1697
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,679
also some people try to

1698
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:21,360
send digital postcards to mastered on

1699
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:23,600
accounts because they look like email

1700
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:25,599
addresses or something

1701
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,960
another thing that's not on a slide is

1702
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,679
we had another

1703
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:30,560
new feature this time that was our named

1704
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:33,199
recipients

1705
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:34,080
so you could for example send mail to

1706
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:37,759
search without

1707
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:39,360
knowing uh their address and they also

1708
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:41,040
have

1709
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:42,880
a really nice postcard wall where you

1710
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,719
can see all the postcards

1711
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,679
you send them the link for that is on

1712
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:47,679
twitter thank you

1713
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:54,640

i hear you so i have to switch some more

1717
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:14,320

1718
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,320

1719
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:19,199
you're doing an awesome job thank you

1720
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,199
for doing it

1721
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:25,519
so just out of curiosity

1722
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:28,400
did you have problem accepting any

1723
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:28,400
cookies or so

1724
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:35,199
no not really i heard

1725
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,679
somewhere that some

1726
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:40,159
really smart people had problems using

1727
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:42,640
the site because of cookies

1728
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:43,920
oh no that was not my problem i only

1729
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:47,600
couldn't use the site

1730
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:52,159
because of overcrowding that was

1731
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:55,040
often one of my my little problems

1732
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:56,960
and please i hope you don't see what i'm

1733
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,280
doing right now in the background with

1734
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,040
uh

1735
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:01,040

1737
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:12,880
to all of you this was the

1738
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:13,519
first congress where we have so many

1739
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,560
women

1740
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:19,199
and so many non-cis people

1741
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:20,719
running that show and being up front the

1742
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:23,599
camera and

1743
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:24,800
making everything up i would really

1744
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,719
thank you all

1745
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,320
thank you that you made that possible

1746
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:30,400
and uh thank you

1747
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:34,880
that we get more and more diverse year

1748
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:39,040
by year

1749
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:43,840
i can only second that and now we are

1750
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:45,760
switching to the c3 infrastructure

1751
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,199
yeah we need to i'm sure a lot of

1752
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,840
questions will be answered

1753
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:49,839
by them

1754
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:55,760
[Music]

1755
01:16:52,239 --> 01:17:00,159
and i try to make up the

1756
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:00,159
slightly but i do not find them right

1757
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:05,360
now

1758
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:08,560
um yeah welcome to the infrastructure

1759
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:12,400
review of the team infrastructure

1760
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:15,040
uh i'm not quite sure if we have the

1761
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:16,400
uh newest revision of the slides cause

1762
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:18,640
my version of the stream isn't loading

1763
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:21,280
right now

1764
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,840
so maybe link when this possible to

1765
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:26,719
press

1766
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:29,440
ctrl r and if you're seeing a

1767
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:31,120
burning computer then we have the actual

1768
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:33,280
slides

1769
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:36,159
let's just play pokemon karaoke without

1770
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:38,080
the background music

1771
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:41,360
yeah and without the powerpoint

1772
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:41,360
presentation in real time

1773
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:48,719
now i'm seeing me let's wait a few

1774
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:52,400
seconds until we see a slide

1775
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:52,400
you want to wait the entire stream delay

1776
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:59,839
it's just about 30 to 1 minute

1777
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,960
yeah i'm tease and i'm waiting and this

1778
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:09,759
is patrick and

1779
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,760
he's waiting too

1780
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:13,919
yeah but that's in the middle of the

1781
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:18,480
slides

1782
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:21,600
can we go okay

1783
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:23,360
yeah i'm now seeing something in the

1784
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:26,880
middle of the slides but yeah

1785
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:29,040
it seems fine okay yeah we have the team

1786
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:32,239
c3 infra

1787
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:34,080
rc3 info we're creating the

1788
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:39,199
infrastructure

1789
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:43,320
next slide we had

1790
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:47,360
about nine terabytes of ram and one

1791
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:52,559
1700 cpu cores on the

1792
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:56,639
whole event there's only one dead ssd

1793
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:59,600
diet because everything's broken

1794
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:00,880
we had five dead rate controllers and

1795
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,920
didn't bother to replace the weight

1796
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:05,920
controllers just

1797
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:09,760
replace them with new servers and a 100

1798
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:13,040
uptime next slide

1799
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:15,520
we looked about 42 hours

1800
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:17,120
on starting screens of enterprise

1801
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:22,560
servers

1802
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:25,040
20 minutes max is what hp delivered

1803
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:27,360
and we are now certified enterprise

1804
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:30,880
observers

1805
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:32,080
we had only 27 percentage visitors using

1806
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,840
ipv6

1807
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:36,080
so that's even less than google

1808
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:39,280
publishers and

1809
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:40,000
even though we had almost full ipv6

1810
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:43,280
coverage

1811
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:46,640
uh except some really really shady

1812
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:51,199
out of band management networks

1813
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:54,080
we're still not at the ipv6 coverage

1814
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:56,960
that we are hoping for

1815
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:58,320
i'm not quite sure if that's the right

1816
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,320
slides

1817
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:02,080
but i'm not quite sure where we are in

1818
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:05,840
the text

1819
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:08,960
uh yeah patrick

1820
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:10,239
yeah so um before the uh congress there

1821
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:13,600
was one prediction

1822
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:16,400
there's no way it cannot be not dns and

1823
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:18,639
well it was dns at least once so uh we

1824
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:22,799
checked that box and let's go over

1825
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:25,920
to the next topic os

1826
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:29,120
we've provisioned about 300 nodes

1827
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:31,760
and it was an ansible powered madness

1828
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:32,639
so yeah there was full disk encryption

1829
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:35,199
on all nodes

1830
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:36,719
uh no ips locked in the access locks we

1831
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:38,400
took extra care of that

1832
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:39,760
and we configured minimal logging

1833
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,320
wherever possible so

1834
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,199
um the case of some problems we only had

1835
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:46,639
warnings

1836
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:49,519
available and um yeah no uh

1837
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:50,239
no info logs no debug logs uh just uh

1838
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,560
the minimal

1839
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:53,678
logging configuration and with uh some

1840
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,760
software we had to

1841
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:57,280
uh pipe logs to death now because the

1842
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:00,000
software just wouldn't stop

1843
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:00,400
uh logging ips and we didn't want that

1844
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,040
so

1845
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:05,920
no personal data unlocks so no gdpr

1846
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:08,639
headache and your data is safe with us

1847
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,040
the ansible madness i've talked about

1848
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:11,280
was

1849
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:13,040
a magical deployment that deep wood

1850
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:15,519
strapped into the live system

1851
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:16,960
and assimilate it into the lc3

1852
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,280
infrastructure

1853
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:21,120
while it's still running so if you

1854
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:26,159
didn't put the machine

1855
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:28,800
then was just running

1856
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:29,280
when a os deployment was broken it was

1857
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,360
almost

1858
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:33,280
always due to network or routing at

1859
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:36,400
least the os team claims that

1860
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:38,639
and this claim is disputed by

1861
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:40,480
the network team of course at one time

1862
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:42,880
the deployment broke because our trigger

1863
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:46,559
had the infra angel

1864
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,560
but let's not talk about that

1865
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:52,800
of course at this point

1866
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:53,919
we want to announce our great

1867
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:57,600
cooperation with

1868
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:59,120
our gold sponsor ddos24.net who provided

1869
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:02,159
an excellent service

1870
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:03,760
of a handcrafted request to our

1871
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:06,960
infrastructure

1872
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:10,239
there was a great demand or great public

1873
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:13,360
demand with some million requests

1874
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:16,480
per second for a while um

1875
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:17,440
but even during the highest or peak

1876
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,678
demand

1877
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:20,559
we were able to serve most of these

1878
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:22,320
services

1879
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,600
we've provided some infrastructure to

1880
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:27,360
vlog and

1881
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:30,080
they've quickly made use of the

1882
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:34,159
provided infrastructure deployed there

1883
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:34,159
overall an amazing time to market

1884
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:38,559
we had six locations and those six

1885
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:40,960
locations were some

1886
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:42,000
wildly different special snowflakes of

1887
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:46,639
wall

1888
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:49,679
so um we had dusseldorf 816 cpu course

1889
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:51,840
there two terabytes of ram and we had

1890
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:54,400
10 gigabits per second interconnect

1891
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:57,360
there was also a one terabit per second

1892
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:58,239
uh infiniband uh available but sadly we

1893
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:01,120
couldn't use that

1894
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:01,759
this would have been nice um the machine

1895
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:04,239
start had

1896
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,800
a weird and engine ipmi which made it

1897
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:07,440
hard

1898
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:08,239
to deploy there and the admin on

1899
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,159
location

1900
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:11,360
never deployed their metal hardware to a

1901
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:13,120
data center so

1902
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:15,360
um there were also some learning

1903
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:17,519
experience there fun fact about

1904
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,799
this love this was the data center with

1905
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,840
the maximum heat

1906
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:23,280
one server seven units uh over nine

1907
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,800
thousand watts of power

1908
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:29,920
eleven point six to be exact um which

1909
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,639
uh where they had some to take some

1910
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:35,840
creative

1911
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:35,840
heat management uh solutions

1912
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:40,480
next was frankfurt there we had 620

1913
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,600
gigabit

1914
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:47,120
of total uplink capacity um

1915
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:50,159
and we actually only used 22 gigabit uh

1916
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:51,239
during peak demand again by our premiums

1917
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:54,719
on the

1918
01:23:51,239 --> 01:23:58,000
ddos24.net um there was zero network

1919
01:23:54,719 --> 01:24:01,360
congestion and 1.5 gigabit uh

1920
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:04,080
per second were ipv so

1921
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,799
there was no real traffic challenge um

1922
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,280
for the

1923
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:09,040
network engineers of you it was a full

1924
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:12,639
layer 3 architecture

1925
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:15,760
with mpls between the one routers

1926
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:16,880
and there was a night shift on the and

1927
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,960
27th

1928
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:21,760
for more servers because some shipments

1929
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,760
didn't arrive yet

1930
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:28,000
the fun fact about this data center was

1931
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:31,280
the maximum bandwidth

1932
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:34,639
some servers there had 50 gigabit uplink

1933
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,960
uh on the server configured um it was

1934
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,960
the

1935
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,719
data vendor with the maximum manual

1936
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,000
intervention of course we had the most

1937
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:43,440
infrastructure there

1938
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:46,159
and it wasn't over subscribed any

1939
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:47,919
at any point we had some hardware in

1940
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:49,360
stuttgart which was basically the

1941
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:51,440
easiest deployment

1942
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,480
um there were also some night shifts but

1943
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:54,638
uh

1944
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:57,040
thanks to niner and team this was a

1945
01:24:54,639 --> 01:25:00,080
really easy deployment

1946
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:02,159
it was also the most silent dc so um no

1947
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:05,519
incident from dame minus five

1948
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:07,519
until now so um if you're

1949
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,560
currently watching from stuttgart now

1950
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:12,480
you can

1951
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:15,600
create some issues because now we set it

1952
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:17,599
well was the smallest dc we only had

1953
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:19,440
three service d and we managed to kill

1954
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:21,760
one hardware rate controller so we only

1955
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:25,040
could use two servers there

1956
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:27,600
so yeah and then

1957
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:28,880
hamburg was the data center with the

1958
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,880
minimum uptime

1959
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:32,400
we never could deploy to this data

1960
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,400
center because there was a broken net

1961
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:37,599
boot and we couldn't

1962
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:41,040
provision anything there and of course

1963
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:44,239
the data center was the headset cloud

1964
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:47,120
where we deployed on all locations um

1965
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:49,040
department fun facts we received a covet

1966
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,559
warning from the data center

1967
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:52,719
luckily it didn't affect us it was at

1968
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,840
another location but uh thanks for the

1969
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:56,960
heads up uh

1970
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:58,719
and the warning um the

1971
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:01,520
team leader of a sponsor needed to

1972
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:04,800
install uh proxmox in a dc

1973
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:07,600
with no knowledge without any clue what

1974
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,960
they were doing we installed proclaimed

1975
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,960
in the hamburg pc

1976
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:13,280
and no server actually wanted to talk to

1977
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:16,480
us so we had to give up on that

1978
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:20,000
and there had to be a lorry relocated

1979
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:23,519
before we could deploy um other

1980
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:26,080
servers so that's that was turning in

1981
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:29,760
the way there

1982
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:30,239
now let's get to jitsi um our pt user

1983
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:34,159
account

1984
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:35,120
where 1105 users at the same time on the

1985
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:38,719
same

1986
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:39,920
cluster i don't know if it was at the

1987
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:41,600
same

1988
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:44,159
time as the peak use account but the

1989
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:46,000
peak conference cut down was 204

1990
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:48,400
conferences

1991
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,040
i hope you can still beat that today but

1992
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:52,000
this

1993
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:53,440
is data from yesterday and the

1994
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,120
conference size was

1995
01:26:53,440 --> 01:27:00,400
94 participants in a single conference

1996
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:02,800
and um let me give

1997
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:04,000
condolences to your computer because

1998
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:07,440
that must have

1999
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:10,719
um been harder on it our peak

2000
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:12,400
outgoing video traffic on the uh video

2001
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:15,679
bridges was 1.3

2002
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:19,280
uh gigabit per second and

2003
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:20,480
we had about three quarters of the

2004
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:23,759
participants

2005
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:26,638
were streaming video and

2006
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:29,679
one quarter of them had video disabled

2007
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:29,679
interesting ratio

2008
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,719
our jc deployment was completely

2009
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:37,760
automated with ansible so

2010
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:40,159
it was zero to jitsi in 15 minutes

2011
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:41,360
we broke up the egyptian cluster into

2012
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:43,360
four shots

2013
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:45,120
to have better scalability and

2014
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:47,519
resilience so if one shot

2015
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:49,679
were down it would only affect a part of

2016
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:52,159
the conferences and not all of them

2017
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:54,159
because there are some uh infrastructure

2018
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:57,360
components that you can't really

2019
01:27:54,159 --> 01:27:58,000
scale or cluster so we went to with a

2020
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:01,599
shouting

2021
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,719
route our j 50 video bridges were about

2022
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,840
42 peak

2023
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:07,440
uh 42 peak usage

2024
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:09,280
excluding our smallest video bridge

2025
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,080
which was only eight cores and eight

2026
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,840
gigabytes

2027
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:13,920
which we added in the beginning uh to

2028
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,800
test some stuff out and it remained in

2029
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:17,679
there

2030
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:18,400
and yes the over provision a bit there

2031
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:21,280
will also be

2032
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:22,480
a blog post on our gt meet deployment

2033
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:26,000
coming in the future

2034
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:29,120
and for the next time we or for

2035
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:32,400
for the upcoming days we will enable

2036
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:36,080
um 4k uh streaming on there so

2037
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:38,320
um why not use that

2038
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:39,600
and uh we want to say thanks to the

2039
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:42,719
ffmeat project

2040
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:43,440
which who contacted us after our initial

2041
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:46,400
load test

2042
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:47,199
and gave us some tips to handle load

2043
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:50,320
effectively

2044
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:53,678
and so on we also tried

2045
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:57,120
making that uh call out uh or

2046
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:59,679
call you know call out working uh

2047
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:00,639
spent 48 hours trying to get it worked

2048
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:04,080
but uh

2049
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:07,199
there were some troubles there so

2050
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:09,280
um sadly no adding

2051
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:11,199
uh that uh participants to agency

2052
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:14,239
conferences for now

2053
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:16,719
um titsy.lc3.world

2054
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:19,440
will be running over new year so you can

2055
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:19,440
use that to

2056
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:24,320
together to get together with your

2057
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,159
friends and so on over the near year

2058
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:28,639
stay separate don't visit each other

2059
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:31,679
please don't contribute

2060
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:35,040
to covert 19s but

2061
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:37,679
you've got the alternative there

2062
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:39,120
now let's go over to monitoring geez

2063
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:41,679
yeah

2064
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:44,080
thanks first of all it's really funny

2065
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:46,560
how you edit this page but

2066
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:48,559
reveal.js doesn't work that way until

2067
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:50,800
linform reloads the page which

2068
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:53,040
hopefully doesn't do right now

2069
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:55,600
everything's fine so

2070
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:56,480
you can leave it to be uh yeah

2071
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,639
monitoring

2072
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,759
we are the previous uh and the light

2073
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:02,800
mention setup

2074
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:05,440
completely driven out of our uh solemnly

2075
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,400
uh one and only source of truth our net

2076
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:09,759
box

2077
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:13,440
we received about 43

2078
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:15,600
43 885 critical alerts it's

2079
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:17,360
uh looking at my mobile phone it's

2080
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:19,120
definitely more right now

2081
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:20,639
and about thirteen thousand seventy

2082
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:24,880
warnings also

2083
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:29,280
definitely more right now and

2084
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:32,840
we tended about 100 of them

2085
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:35,840
the rest was kind of useless next slide

2086
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,840
please

2087
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:42,320

2088
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:44,638
uh to have an abuse hotline into the

2089
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:47,199
abuse contact i received

letting us know that someone doesn't

2093
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:55,840
like our infrastructure as much as we do

2094
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:58,639
uh props to ddos24.net and

2095

it won't be possible to create such a

2123
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:11,280
huge event and such

2124
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:15,280
loads of infrastructure without them and

2125
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:15,280
that's everything we have

2126
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:24,800
amazing thank you

2127
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:27,920

01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:30,480
and sharing everything to the public so

2129
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:31,600
i promised that there will be a kind of

2130
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:33,839
behind-the-scenes

2131
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,670
look of this infrastructure talk or

2132
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,760
review

2133
01:32:34,670 --> 01:32:37,360
[Music]

2134
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,719
and i really have nothing to do with it

2135
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,599
everything was done by completely

2136
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,840
different people

2137
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,760
i'm only a herod somehow lost and

2138
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:46,719
troubled to this stream

2139
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:47,679
and so i'm just going to say switch to

2140
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:55,840
wherever

2141
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:55,840
show also magic

2142
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:05,839
three hours ago i got a call

2143
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:10,480
hello and welcome from the last point of

2144
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,760
the infrastructure review and greetings

2145
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:13,599
from catsworm

2146
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:15,520
so three hours ago i got a call from

2147
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:18,960
lindrom and he asked me

2148
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:21,440
how is it with this last

2149
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:22,320
talk we have um it may be a bit

2150
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:24,320
complicated

2151
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:25,679
and he told me okay we have a speaker

2152
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:28,799
i'm the herald

2153
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:31,199
oh as always so and then we realized

2154
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:34,560
yeah we don't have only one speaker

2155
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:36,799
we have 24. and for that we

2156
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,840
called cows west and build up an

2157
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:40,880
infrastructure

2158
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:44,639
which dumfcutzer will explain you now

2159
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,639
in a short minute i think so

2160
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:49,360
thank you um yes oh i lost the sticker

2161
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:53,280
okay

2162
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:55,839
after we called uh chaos west we

2163
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:57,519
came up with this monstrosity of the

2164
01:33:55,840 --> 01:34:02,400
video

2165
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:06,880
cluster and we start here

2166
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:10,320
the teams uh streamed via obs ninja

2167
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:13,360
onto three uh chaos chaos west

2168
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:17,040
uh um studios

2169
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:20,880
they were brought together via rtmp

2170
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:23,920
on our mix one local

2171
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:28,239
studio and

2172
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:31,360
then we pumped that into mix 2 which

2173
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:32,000
pumped it further to the walk the slides

2174
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:35,440
were brought

2175
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,480
in uh via another obs ninja directly

2176
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:40,000
onto mix2

2177
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:42,159
they cam came from lindworm um

2178
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:45,840
also the clothing you will see shortly

2179
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:48,320
hopefully will also come from there

2180
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:49,920
and yusuf and linform were directly

2181
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:53,040
connected via obs

2182
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:56,480
ninja onto our mix one

2183
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:59,440
computer and uh
