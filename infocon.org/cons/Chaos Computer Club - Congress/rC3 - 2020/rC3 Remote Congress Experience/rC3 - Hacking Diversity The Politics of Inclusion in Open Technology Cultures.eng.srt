1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:10,520
[Music]

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,520
[Applause]

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,480
alright

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,160
so our next talk is called hacking

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,279
diversity

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,198
where we basically try to treat a really

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,800
awkward question about these spaces that

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,880
we move in here

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,800
which is that we really have these ideas

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,000
about inclusion and diversity but in the

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,480
end most of the people that

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,760
come just look like me and in open

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,360
source

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,839
most people look like me and this is

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,200
extremely strange right because we have

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,160
all of these ideas

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,120
about diversity and everything and today

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,959
we try to

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,559
answer the question why this happens and

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,360
maybe what we can do about it our

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,599
speaker for this

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,440
is professor christina dumber hester

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,199
she's a professor at the university of

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,519
southern california i think

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,800
and today she is preparing she is

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,559
showing essentially

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,319
a condensed version of a book that she

28
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,599
just wrote called hacking diversity

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,920
and i'm really looking forward to this

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,200
talk because i i also have asked myself

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,760
these questions and i don't know the

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,520
answers

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,119
so i'm looking forward to this please

34
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,080
christina

35
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,799
thank you so much thank you for the

36
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,720
introduction and thank you for the

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,520
invitation and thank you for all of your

38
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,840
labor to get this uh

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,399
remote experience off the ground so i'm

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,600
really happy and excited to

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,799
be here whatever that is um and i will

42
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,640
get into the talk

43
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,640
let's see here um

44
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,079
okay

45
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,000
let me know you should be able to see

46
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,798
slides now

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,280
if that didn't work let me know okay uh

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,040
thanks

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,560
this is not a best practices

50
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,280
talk so much as a first principles and

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,360
and how did we get here talk uh my

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,719
examples are mostly from the us

53
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,399
but they are part of a

54
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:10,399
broader euro-american milieu

55
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:13,760
um and so to get started i think i

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,800
want to uh put up this quote

57
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,319
from the free software foundation from

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,319
2012. and the goal of this talk is

59
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,119
really to give some

60
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,119
context and i think at the almost very

61
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,680
end of 2020 it's safe to say that this

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,200
is

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,160
a fairly mainstream and uncontroversial

64
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,760
topic

65
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,239
but it wasn't always this way so the

66
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,799
quote says the free software movement

67
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,280
needs

68
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,000
diverse participation to achieve its

69
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,160
goals

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,120
if we want to make proprietary software

71
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,200
extinct

72
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,720
we need to make everyone on the planet

73
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,399
engage with free software

74
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,480
to get there we need people of all

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,040
genders races

76
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,160
sexual orientations and abilities

77
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,879
leading the way

78
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,239
and as i said i think this is a very

79
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,280
recognizable

80
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,120
uh sort of discourse now um but it

81
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,599
hasn't always been and i'm going to sort

82
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,280
of

83
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:10,000
unpack this for a little while um

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,440
the outline of the talk this is a pretty

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,879
bare bones outline

86
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,359
but there's going to be a lot of sort of

87
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,599
history and context

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,959
and then a little bit about the value

89
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,959
and goal of diversity

90
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,159
and how it relates to profits and

91
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,200
markets

92
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,720
and also the goal of diversity and how

93
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,040
it relates to other

94
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,560
values particularly justice and i want

95
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,840
to note that there's

96
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,720
a couple of content warning slides on

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,840
here

98
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,680
um one for people who've been involved

99
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,760
in promulgating genocide

100
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,120
and another for a person who's been

101
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,159
ejected from hacking

102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,280
for abusive behavior and so there will

103
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,399
be a warning

104
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,599
preceding uh each of those

105
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,840
um okay so first

106
00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:01,280
talking about uh genocide um

107
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:05,040
in the 19th century in the united states

108
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,920
and even into the 20th century

109
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,040
there was an idea of a sort of

110
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,879
frontiersman

111
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,439
a brawny man who you can see here this

112
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,079
is a

113
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,238
folk hero but was important enough to

114
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,840
still be being represented on television

115
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,078
in the 1960s

116
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,198
uh and the sort of consistent thing here

117
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,560
is

118
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,479
i'm gonna actually go this is the

119
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,840
genocide one um

120
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,440
to these sort of consistent

121
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,479
representations you can see these folks

122
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,680
are wearing

123
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,599
well they're you know they're they're

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,080
men and they're being manly and they're

125
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,400
wearing

126
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,159
you know animal hide with the

127
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,359
implication that they maybe you know

128
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,080
shot the deer themself uh they carry a

129
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,040
gun

130
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,680
they're in naturalistic settings they're

131
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:57,199
sort of

132
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:59,280
you know rough and ready for anything

133
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,240
i'm drawing here on historian susan

134
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,320
douglas

135
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,759
who argues that around the turn of the

136
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,919
20th century

137
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,520
society started to change and so even

138
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,919
though there was still this

139
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,280
you know mythos of this brawny

140
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,520
frontiersman

141
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,159
uh what society actually needed was a

142
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,080
reconfigured masculinity that didn't

143
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,840
sort of have this you know rough

144
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,440
physical brawny

145
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,440
uh masculinity and so masculinity itself

146
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,320
she says was reconfigured

147
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,199
to what she calls technical masculinity

148
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,919
and so

149
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,440
uh the masculinity was sort of

150
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,280
re-fashioned

151
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,840
to be about mastery over

152
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,638
uh machines and particularly these sort

153
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,880
of new

154
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,680
cutting edge electronic machines which

155
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,360
in this case

156
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,320
was uh radio so radio experimentation in

157
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,160
the very early 20th century

158
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,880
first wireless telegraphy and then later

159
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,319
wireless sound transmission which became

160
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,199
broadcasting

161
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,240
uh she argues as a way to sort of re-fit

162
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,160
masculinity

163
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,520
for the way the society was changing it

164
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,800
was more urban

165
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,080
there was more specialized division of

166
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,479
labor

167
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,400
needing people to work in you know

168
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,880
professional white collar fields

169
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,960
with technology as opposed to going out

170
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,280
and settling the west

171
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,880
and so here we see techno technical

172
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,919
masculinity

173
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,960
uh entrainment basically a father with

174
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,840
his very young

175
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,159
son you know teaching him this is you

176
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,799
know

177
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,880
a way to be in the world um and

178
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,680
douglas argues that this started with

179
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,719
ham radio in the early 20th century

180
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,440
but perhaps unsurprisingly it

181
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,479
continued to sort of persist over time

182
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,440
and so my next

183
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,280
few slides are showing the same

184
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,680
technical masculinity which is about you

185
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,599
know

186
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,759
curiosity solving a problem uh

187
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,639
you know expressing your will with

188
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,759
technology

189
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,199
only with different sorts of technical

190
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,720
artifacts

191
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,880
and so here this is the model railroad

192
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,160
made very famous in steven levy's book

193
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,319
about hackers

194
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,599
we also have um this is probably about

195
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,960
the 1950s

196
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:20,560
we have phone freaking in the 1960s

197
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,758
and here this is also a 2600 magazine

198
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,199
from the 80s

199
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:29,280
sort of continuing to mythologize

200
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,080
phone freaking going into the 70s we see

201
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,000
this with

202
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,039
computers the homebrew computer club

203
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,479
really important hobbyist formation

204
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,479
for both um you know the history of

205
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,199
silicon valley but also the history of

206
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,800
of hacking

207
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,240
and free software was people who are

208
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,080
sort of building and tinkering and

209
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,160
experimenting

210
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,520
and so what we're starting to see here

211
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,360
is even as the

212
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,840
tech shifts the technical masculinity

213
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,039
stays consistent and this is probably

214
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,159
the early 80s

215
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,199
and this slide is just an ad for a

216
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,759
microcomputer

217
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,680
but we can see you know not only the

218
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,800
representation of masculinity at the

219
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,199
center

220
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,199
we also see femininity in relation to

221
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,199
the technology which is to say it's just

222
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,319
a sort of you know ancillary

223
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:22,800
handmaiden um for the sort of male

224
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:25,919
agent here um and as i said this is all

225
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,360
certainly a really cheesy ad but i think

226
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,318
i hope underscores the sort of

227
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,680
consistent

228
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,200
uh promulgation of this uh relationship

229
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,839
with technology

230
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,560
and so i want to suggest is that tech

231
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,479
here

232
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:43,679
over the 20th and into the 21st century

233
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,000
is not just reflecting a legacy of

234
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,880
division

235
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,040
of which gender prescription gender

236
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,200
roles are a part of this

237
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,240
but it's actually actively been involved

238
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,839
in enforcing

239
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,959
this and so we've got basically a white

240
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,560
patriarchal christian native-born

241
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,399
supremacy

242
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,760
and a global system of racial capitalism

243
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,600
and so i've shown you who's sort of at

244
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,000
the top of this hierarchy

245
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,040
uh we've got colonized subjects

246
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,240
immigrants

247
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,880
women rural and lower class people

248
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,440
indigenous people coming out on the

249
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,160
bottom

250
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,640
and both builders and consumers of tech

251
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,839
are

252
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,600
implicated in this tension

253
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,519
um okay so going back even further

254
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,880
in the history to sort of where some of

255
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,320
this comes from

256
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,560
i'm not sure how many of you thought

257
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,480
that in a discussion of hacking you'd be

258
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,279
looking at a 19th century american oil

259
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,600
painting

260
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,640
but here we are this is called american

261
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,279
progress

262
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,160
so again think mythologized american

263
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,279
progress

264
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,279
from the late 19th century and

265
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,040
uh as you can probably see there's a

266
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,959
real sort of light to dark

267
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,240
element of the photo or of the picture

268
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,518
of the painting

269
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,079
um and we have this maiden

270
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,040
uh who's really not so much a person but

271
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,359
more like a

272
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,800
a god uh this is a sort of greek

273
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,160
iconography

274
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,519
um sort of up above everyone up above

275
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,000
man

276
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,839
and we do see technology in in the

277
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,880
painting we see the railroads

278
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,880
and the some ships on the sort of

279
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,680
right-hand side which is the east

280
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,560
and so you can tell that she's sort of

281
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,800
presiding over

282
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,239
everybody settling the west and again

283
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,359
they're bringing the light which is

284
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,360
civilization

285
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,760
the maiden herself is actually carrying

286
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,519
a book which symbolizes knowledge

287
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,519
and what may not be obvious but she's

288
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,200
actually got telegraph wire

289
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,320
strung around her arm and then you can

290
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:46,160
see the telegraph kind of behind her

291
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:49,200
and so this you know control over

292
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,240
technology is you know part of

293
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,600
how white settler you know

294
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,040
newly arrived uh americans are

295
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,880
maintaining or sort of promoting and

296
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,519
maintaining dominance over

297
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,040
their new continent their new continent

298
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,720
and you can actually see that so we've

299
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,360
got these you know white settler

300
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,399
folks in the center of the painting all

301
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,480
the way in the dark

302
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,240
are indigenous people and there's also

303
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,279
actually a bear so there's sort of again

304
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,320
a

305
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,640
biblical hierarchy of you know man

306
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,600
over the beasts uh and you can tell them

307
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,920
that the

308
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,200
indigenous subjects and the bear are

309
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,120
probably either going to get run out of

310
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,160
the frame or sort of forced to become

311
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:32,320
civilized so this is very deep uh

312
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,920
in how american sort of hierarchy

313
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:39,680
uh and and notions of dominance get

314
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:43,120
promoted and uh you know sort of

315
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,399
renewed over time um and this is

316
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,760
interesting because this

317
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,959
ideology is so strong that it's actually

318
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,720
succeeded in basically erasing some of

319
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,880
the historical record

320
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,639
like for instance we know that there

321
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,920
were

322
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,839
women highly skilled women operators in

323
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,760
world war ii operating the first

324
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,800
electronic computers

325
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,519
this is eniac in the us but they were

326
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,839
still

327
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,880
they were sort of written out of the

328
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,160
record

329
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:17,279
and computing once it became popular

330
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:21,279
and you know moved out of a top secret

331
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,600
military project the women's roles

332
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,000
were basically effaced and you know

333
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,240
credit for

334
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,839
dominance over and sort of control over

335
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,279
the new technology

336
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,079
publicly went to men uh and again so we

337
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,920
see this

338
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,399
sort of sorting happening in all these

339
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,639
different ways even in defiance of the

340
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,399
actual historical record

341
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:47,440
another instance which um

342
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,839
may be kind of surprising is this is a

343
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,079
really

344
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,240
wonderful article by lisa nakamura that

345
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,439
i'm drawing from here

346
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,440
this is a

347
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,040
fair child semiconductor so they're

348
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,320
based in silicon valley

349
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,240
they used to make microchips

350
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,760
and associated equipment in silicon

351
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,600
valley

352
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,319
but they had an intermediate period

353
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,600
before outsourcing that stuff to asia

354
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,600
where they opened operations on a

355
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,959
navajo reservation in the american

356
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,240
southwest

357
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:25,119
and so there's really interesting ways

358
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,160
in which race and gender basically

359
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,040
become

360
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,560
resources for valuing the labor of some

361
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,959
kind of people

362
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,079
uh more and other kinds of people less

363
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,000
so this

364
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,680
reservation was attractive because

365
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,120
regular american

366
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,760
labor laws didn't obtain and they also

367
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,160
managers in their minds thought oh

368
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,199
there's

369
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,800
this history of navajo weaving

370
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:54,800
and sort of fine fabrication work and so

371
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:58,240
uh there's a sort of stereotype that uh

372
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,680
non-white people particularly women um

373
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,600
you know particularly in this day and

374
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,839
age asian have

375
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,360
quote nimble fingers and are going to be

376
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,680
really good and diligent

377
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,040
at uh something that we need like

378
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,279
electronics assembly

379
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,360
to be really sort of diligently done and

380
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,560
so what we've got here is the sort of

381
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:20,160
overlay of navajo weaving

382
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:23,040
and microchip

383
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,360
so nakamura calls this insourcing sort

384
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,639
of outsourcing before outsourcing

385
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,360
um and you know now those laboratories

386
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,120
and

387
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,320
uh factories have mostly moved to asia

388
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,880
but this sort of period of

389
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,240
experimentation with trying to like

390
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,000
uh alienate the the labor from the sort

391
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,120
of managerial home and so now we would

392
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,160
think like

393
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,399
um you know your apple product says

394
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,160
assembled in china designed in cupertino

395
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,959
or whatever that that kind of thing

396
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,319
this is a sort of early moment of that

397
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,920
um

398
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,519
and so again i want to sort of

399
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,000
underscore that race and gender

400
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,199
are a resource for global capitalism to

401
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,320
assign worth

402
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,560
to some people's bodies and work and

403
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,760
not to others another way that this

404
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,399
works

405
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,439
i don't know how much people in the us

406
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,920
will remember this

407
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,480
let alone outside of the u.s but this is

408
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,240
a student a high school student who is

409
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,720
sudanese american i believe who was

410
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,600
you know a geek and he was enthusiastic

411
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,720
about

412
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,519
doing a diy electronics assembly

413
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,480
at home where he built a clock and he

414
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,680
brought it to school

415
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,279
and the school called police and so here

416
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,359
we can see that

417
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,639
you know whiteness has been a resource

418
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,519
for avoiding

419
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,160
criminalization for certain kinds of

420
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,440
sort of

421
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,240
hacky activities um i'm certainly not

422
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,759
saying

423
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,440
that no white people have been

424
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,920
criminalized for hacking because that's

425
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,720
not

426
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,519
true but certain activities get more of

427
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,639
a pass

428
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,519
based on who's participating in them and

429
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,519
i also want to

430
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,519
point out that this legacy of the

431
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,800
division and this

432
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:06,240
um system of social sorting

433
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,359
is flexible in you know 2015 it could

434
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,480
easily be turned

435
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:14,320
to islamophobic

436
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,920
purposes which is what happened here um

437
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,240
and so what i want to point out is that

438
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,120
there's a sort of like

439
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,720
you know history of of division and and

440
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,720
really sort of policing

441
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,079
uh whose inbounds and who's out of

442
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,680
bounds for

443
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:33,199
the most celebrated uh category of

444
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,120
technological agent but i also want to

445
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,719
sort of introduce the idea that this is

446
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,759
not

447
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,800
inconsistent in a way with diversity

448
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:45,440
as a market value

449
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,560
capitalism is actually happy to affirm

450
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,880
difference

451
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,239
if it can help sell something even

452
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,920
though here we also see

453
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,079
the sort of um you know cultural and and

454
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,199
even legal system being brought to bear

455
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:02,479
to to punish certain forms of difference

456
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,000
um okay so

457
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,160
at this point this kind of statement is

458
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,039
really ubiquitous this is from 2012 from

459
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,160
a tech

460
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,400
techcrunch post uh in my mind

461
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,360
the women in tech discussion should

462
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,600
really be framed

463
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,039
as having different people with

464
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,159
different experiences and different

465
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,119
outlooks

466
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,799
helps you build a better product so this

467
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,319
is a pretty different framing of

468
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,000
difference than the one i just showed

469
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,440
you

470
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,799
but the the point is

471
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,960
capitalism is actually able to sort of

472
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,679
reconcile these in um

473
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,640
these contradictions in a way and you

474
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,880
can also see this is my name tag from a

475
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,559
google sponsored event i attended for

476
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,039
for work for this book

477
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,559
and you know they're not only saying you

478
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,360
know we need women to help us build a

479
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,600
better product

480
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,039
they're also reflecting back this sort

481
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,799
of uh

482
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,640
symbol of femininity you know the pink

483
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,639
venus sign which of course turns a lot

484
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,440
of people off but it's uh

485
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,160
you know if you're thinking about

486
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,520
marketing it's a way to symbolize

487
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,919
this inclusion right um

488
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,840
now i'm going to put up the only

489
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,120
horribly academic slide i have for the

490
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,159
whole talk

491
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,360
uh this is a quote from herman gray

492
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,080
who says abstract notions of rights and

493
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,639
freedom

494
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,879
and their expansion to new subjects

495
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,200
elide the social salience of race and

496
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,280
gender as a basis of inequality

497
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,200
even as it culturally recognizes and

498
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,760
celebrates differences

499
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,760
so here we can see you know the market

500
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,799
is happy to recognize and celebrate

501
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,160
difference to sort of

502
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:39,200
take up um you know

503
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,240
uh you know women in tech or whatever

504
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,039
while sort of papering over and doing

505
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,240
nothing to unseat the sort of core which

506
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,440
is that

507
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,320
race and gender are bases of inequality

508
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,120
so you can sort of have this lip service

509
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,399
abstract

510
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:59,039
expansion of um you know

511
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,720
new identities but what is sort of

512
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,520
always intact is even if you're sort of

513
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,600
bringing

514
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,879
one group over and saying oh you know

515
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,080
you're part of the

516
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,240
the dominant group now in some way uh

517
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,199
the system of sorting is remaining

518
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,720
intact

519
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,200
and uh in a less abstract way

520
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,640
like in the us this summer there's huge

521
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,000
you know black lives matter

522
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,440
protests uprisings uh and pretty quickly

523
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
all these companies

524
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,440
started saying oh yes black lives matter

525
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,520
we support this

526
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,440
you know amazon was really prominent

527
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,320
among them and yet

528
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,840
amazon doesn't stop to question whether

529
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,960
or not it's exploiting

530
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,320
a racialized workforce uh during covid

531
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,679
with you know warehouse work and

532
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,439
delivery work these are some of the

533
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,520
lowest paid workers

534
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,640
they are not getting health insurance

535
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,799
they're not getting

536
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,160
consistent you know hazard pay or

537
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,480
protection

538
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,360
and they're dying at disproportionate uh

539
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,600
rates

540
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,959
um but you know amazon's very happy to

541
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:02,320
say black lives matter is part of the pr

542
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,400
uh similarly they're still

543
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,240
you know basically building uh

544
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,039
surveillance equipment

545
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,320
um but there there's you know there's no

546
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,760
inconsistency between sort of

547
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,720
recognition and celebration of

548
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,000
difference

549
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,200
while working to continue to cement that

550
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,799
difference and exploit

551
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,600
that difference um so all

552
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,320
all this is to say is that diversity is

553
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,439
uh

554
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,639
in my opinion a rather toothless

555
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,840
uh value to sort of attach

556
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,640
the the work uh and the sort of meaning

557
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,320
for

558
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,480
you know what's at stake with with

559
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,918
working with tech and with inclusion

560
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,000
too uh diversity can sort of bring our

561
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,880
attention to these patterns of social

562
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,559
difference

563
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,799
but if it ends there it can actually

564
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:51,120
kind of draw us in the wrong directions

565
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,720
without the tools we might need to

566
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,120
um you know actually make some of the

567
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,799
more

568
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,399
you know justice affirming points that i

569
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,879
think are why people are drawn

570
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,080
to these topics in the first place okay

571
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,960
so after this

572
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,360
uh digression getting more some into how

573
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,360
this

574
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,120
relates to hacking and free software um

575
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,559
so i've established a sort of legacy of

576
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,959
division

577
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,760
uh and i wanna sort of underscore that

578
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,080
the

579
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:22,559
hacking and free software milieu has had

580
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,639
this commitment to freedom and openness

581
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:28,799
that's definitely been

582
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,799
at the core pretty consistently

583
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,080
but historically this has really had to

584
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,918
do with you know the

585
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,520
freedom and openness has been about

586
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,320
controlling technology

587
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,158
some free speech of course uh it's

588
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,320
definitely about the individual's

589
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,559
exercise of freedom

590
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,559
uh without necessarily a lot of thought

591
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,080
about you know who the individual is

592
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,840
who's maximally empowered

593
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:54,879
to you know be free um

594
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,799
or it's been about individuals in

595
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,760
collectives but that are relatively

596
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,799
small and relatively homogeneous

597
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,000
and so what i want to suggest is this

598
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,960
sat within

599
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,520
the bigger context of tech and division

600
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,120
but

601
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,639
without really acknowledging this

602
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,039
because the you know

603
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,960
freedom of the individual was presented

604
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,799
as a sort of universal value

605
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,080
even though in practice it really really

606
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,840
wasn't

607
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,000
um and i think around 15 to 20 years ago

608
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,639
that really started to change

609
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,159
um when i started working on this

610
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,200
project there was already

611
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,640
a good deal of agitation forming uh some

612
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,000
of these groups

613
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,799
uh in free software and related projects

614
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,559
uh to especially draw attention to the

615
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,600
sort of disparities around women

616
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:46,639
and pi star was uh

617
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,918
initially for sort of women and it was

618
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,600
was trans-inclusive

619
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,960
and you know i think pretty quickly this

620
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,080
started as a women

621
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,640
but then it became often uh non-binary

622
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,760
and trans-inclusive so not a sort of

623
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,280
essentialist

624
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:04,158
version of women um something happened

625
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,879
in 2006 that really caused this

626
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,480
topic to really spring to the fore and a

627
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,760
lot of these communities

628
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,679
there was an eu policy report

629
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,960
uh that came out so the research was

630
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:19,360
from you know 2004-2005

631
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,200
uh that showed that the rate of

632
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,719
participation by women and

633
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:28,080
floss was less than two percent

634
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,159
and that was significantly less even

635
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,600
than academic and proprietary computer

636
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,679
science and so that i think really

637
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,039
stalked people who had maybe

638
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:40,240
sort of intuitively known oh yeah

639
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:43,279
this isn't very representative but

640
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,600
that number really uh

641
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,480
galvanized a lot of conversations and

642
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,918
and got people

643
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,440
started talking and organizing basically

644
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,440
in new ways

645
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,799
and so i'm now going to show just a

646
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,400
handful of sort of

647
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:00,400
what this report uh

648
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,640
caused which is again a bunch of

649
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,360
conversations this is from

650
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,159
the hackers on planet earth hope

651
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,760
conference

652
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,360
in new york in 2006

653
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,000
and it may not totally be clear what's

654
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:17,120
going on here

655
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,159
but some folks had responded to

656
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,799
this statistic on the one hand and this

657
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,080
quote

658
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:27,120
from this united states senator

659
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,039
who had said something like

660
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,039
sort of gibberish about he was supposed

661
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,640
to be considering net neutrality and

662
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,480
internet regulation

663
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,720
and he said something like the internet

664
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,200
is a series of tubes it's not a truck

665
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,000
that you

666
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,520
dump something on and everybody was

667
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,760
making fun of them for not even

668
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,279
you know understanding network computing

669
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,158
at all

670
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,360
but these activists sort of put these

671
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,200
together

672
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,959
in a sort of match up and they were

673
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,640
selling t-shirts actually that said the

674
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,000
internet a series of tubes and as you

675
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,919
can see that's a

676
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,240
sort of textbook representation of um

677
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,679
like a female reproductive system

678
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,600
and so they just sort of brought this to

679
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,000
the conference and they were

680
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,600
you know trying to force a conversation

681
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,880
about it because they estimated this is

682
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,840
not an official count

683
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,640
but they estimated that there were maybe

684
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,559
um

685
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,320
the ratio of women to men at hope was

686
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,440
like one to forty

687
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,678
and so they just wanted to force a

688
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,960
conversation about this

689
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:28,080
um this is an artifact from

690
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,679
a little bit later 2014 but the rise of

691
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,520
explicitly dedicated feminist hacker

692
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,880
spaces and this is from the us

693
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:40,000
and it's just a flyer for a zine making

694
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,159
workshop which is again a pretty

695
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,200
you know mundane thing but just the sort

696
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:48,080
of difference between the 2006

697
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,279
um sort of flag planting and something a

698
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,960
bit later where there's actually a

699
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,760
separate space here

700
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,200
and uh crucially you know z making isn't

701
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,320
necessarily

702
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:02,000
in bounds with traditional hacking

703
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:04,960
but it is uh closer to

704
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,159
sort of strands of you know feminist

705
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,480
consciousness raising

706
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,640
and you know riot girl and so there's a

707
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,279
sort of intermingling of these

708
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,559
uh different kind of threads of diy

709
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,600
basically

710
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,559
um this is another artifact from someone

711
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,520
in philadelphia

712
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,039
who was an artist and a designer and was

713
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,760
trying to find a way

714
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:31,120
from the stuff that she knew how to do

715
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:34,320
with you know craft and sewing

716
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,120
and find a way into electronics and soft

717
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,039
circuits

718
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,918
and um you know doing new things and so

719
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,559
she

720
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,440
kind of for her own exploration knitted

721
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,639
a scarf

722
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,120
using ethernet cables and for her this

723
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,679
was a kind of speculative object

724
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,360
um that was meant to help her find her

725
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,640
way into electronics

726
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,959
uh but also to kind of start

727
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,760
conversations about you know

728
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,039
why haven't these things gone together

729
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,840
um

730
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:08,679
also seeing gatherings like this one

731
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,000
uh the a more sort of explicitly

732
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:13,200
radicalized

733
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,559
um feminist hacking convergence and i

734
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,520
don't know if everybody can read all the

735
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,960
text but

736
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:24,120
it says trans futuristic cyborgs

737
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:26,399
anti-racist anti-sexist gynepunk

738
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,840
d-i-y-d-i-w-o so taking

739
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:32,639
diy of a sort of heroic individualist

740
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,199
to doing it with others making it more

741
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,159
self-consciously collective and less

742
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,559
you know individual self-reliant it also

743
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,039
says

744
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,760
gender hacking anti-capitalism libre

745
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,279
culture

746
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,840
technologies biohacking so again a sort

747
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,520
of

748
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:52,559
spectrum of uh politics

749
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,760
and interventions around hacking

750
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:58,559
and feminist hacking um

751
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,240
and i'm gonna dwell for a moment on

752
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,080
feminist servers

753
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,880
haven't spent too much i haven't had too

754
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:08,000
much text on slides but this one is

755
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,080
um so these are artifacts that were on

756
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,919
the one hand

757
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,520
basically like an independently

758
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,360
maintained server

759
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:20,879
run primarily by women identifying folks

760
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:24,399
or non-masculine identifying folks um

761
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,240
running free software but they're also

762
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,439
a sort of list of networking principles

763
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,960
that gets

764
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,799
out of that more kind of literal

765
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,240
artifactual mode

766
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:37,840
into a um more

767
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:41,120
sort of speculative and uh

768
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,039
aspirational sort of politics

769
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,239
of of what it means to be doing this and

770
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,320
so the first

771
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,240
couple it's actually a very long list

772
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,000
and i only have a handful up here

773
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,080
the first couple i think are very

774
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,360
consonant with kind of mainstream

775
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,480
hacking

776
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,320
wants networks to be mutable and read

777
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,399
write accessible

778
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,320
and radically questions the conditions

779
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,120
for serving and service experiments with

780
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:08,000
changing client server relations

781
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,600
those again seem kind of axiomatic for

782
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,039
mainstream

783
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,039
hacking but then the feminist server

784
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,360
starts to go in some other directions

785
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,440
uh is autonomous in the sense that she

786
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,879
decides her own dependencies i think

787
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,840
this one's really interesting and

788
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,360
important

789
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,480
it's again it's getting away from this

790
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,760
kind of heroic individualistic

791
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:33,120
uh or almost sort of libertarian

792
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:35,039
um sense of autonomy it's

793
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,320
just the autonomy is about deciding

794
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,919
where you're dependent and being

795
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,600
you know sort of transparent and open

796
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,320
about that it's not about

797
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,360
you know bootstrapping or being you know

798
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,039
individually

799
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,439
um self-sufficient uh does not strive

800
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,679
for seamlessness division of labor the

801
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,559
not so fun stuff is made by people

802
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,240
that's a feminist

803
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,240
issue that one i think is really

804
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,600
important a lot of hacking

805
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,600
that goes on in say a global north

806
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,799
context

807
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,439
is you know about the artifacts and the

808
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,480
practices

809
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,679
in that moment but here this is if it's

810
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,000
not clear

811
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,520
drawing attention to you know where did

812
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,960
that come from it shouldn't be a

813
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,559
seamless experience where you're not

814
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,760
thinking about the

815
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,918
you know pre-history the supply chain

816
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,679
of this artifact which actually started

817
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,399
with you know mining

818
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,279
and fabrication and assembly and

819
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,399
shipping

820
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:33,919
and we'll also have a post-use um

821
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:38,080
life which you know might be recycling

822
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:40,799
might be very hazardous um

823
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,520
you know reclaiming of precious metals

824
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,480
by people

825
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,440
without good labor protections um or

826
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,600
might not

827
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,880
but sort of instead of having this all

828
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,480
be invisible sort of

829
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,159
drawing it forward treats technology as

830
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,520
part of a social reality

831
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,200
this is a big one but it's really just

832
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,679
sort of opening up the space

833
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,919
to acknowledge that legacy of division

834
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,080
that i was talking about earlier

835
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,440
and takes the risk of exposing her

836
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,678
insecurity

837
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,000
um i like this one so much it's it's

838
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,279
really evocative on a few levels

839
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,880
but at the most sort of basic level what

840
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,840
i want to point out is that it's very

841
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,640
different

842
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,080
than again a sort of thread or a strand

843
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,399
of hacking that's about

844
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,199
you know owning hard or mastery or

845
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,799
something

846
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:30,320
uh instead it's it's being um

847
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:33,120
you know sort of present with

848
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,320
oneself and with others and you know

849
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,080
disclosing

850
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,320
insecurities which could be you know

851
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,360
network insecurities or

852
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,279
personal ones right uh so it's taking

853
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,399
what it means to be engaging and hacking

854
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,760
in all these

855
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:49,279
new and sort of mutated directions um

856
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,120
one more example from the sort of

857
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,679
feminist hacking

858
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,239
that i want to just tell you about for a

859
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,440
second

860
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,840
uh was this exercise i was at a

861
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,080
feminist hacking convergence in montreal

862
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,519
in 2016 and people

863
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,918
did a exercise in understanding public

864
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,360
key

865
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:12,080
cryptography as a dance

866
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,519
where you know instead of learning about

867
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,678
this

868
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,159
theory people actually tried to embody

869
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,440
it so placing your body in the

870
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,440
relationship with tech

871
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,640
and often some of these things happen in

872
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,760
kind of explicitly separate spaces

873
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,799
but going through the principles of

874
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,919
cryptography

875
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:34,559
in a spontaneously choreographed dance

876
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,760
and then performing it all together okay

877
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,559
so these are some of the

878
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,879
again ways the mutant strains of

879
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,320
feminist hacking

880
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,720
i don't want to suggest that this has

881
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,600
been just a very linear and

882
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,000
conflict-free

883
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,799
progression uh and so i do want to dwell

884
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,640
for a moment

885
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:55,519
on just a single instance of of conflict

886
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,080
uh which probably the details will be

887
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,440
unfamiliar

888
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,519
but there might be a sort of wider

889
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,320
recognition i think

890
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,880
um so this is from a hackerspace in

891
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,840
philadelphia in 2011

892
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:12,080
and a handful of members of the space

893
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:16,399
proposed uh holding an event to

894
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:18,559
hack sex toys and they

895
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:22,080
thought it was a pretty uncontroversial

896
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:24,960
suggestion you know the same as

897
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,918
you know having an arduino night or uh

898
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,840
you know

899
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,120
i'm making stuff up but you know they

900
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,439
they sort of put it out there as it's

901
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,918
like well let's do this on this saturday

902
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,159
and they were really surprised uh when a

903
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,679
bunch of other members of the space were

904
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,840
very opposed to it and this is

905
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,200
um this is in the book it's a design for

906
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,918
a di diy

907
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,120
flogger made from a bicycle tube and

908
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,960
this was on the

909
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,000
um proposed uh sort of flyer for the

910
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,000
event

911
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,840
uh and and so what happened was they

912
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,840
were they were really surprised that

913
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,439
uh other people in the space were sort

914
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,240
of like no no we don't want to have this

915
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,159
here

916
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,000
uh we don't think it's appropriate and

917
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,000
so here's a quote from one of the people

918
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,760
who was opposing

919
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,599
uh the event and he says

920
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,918
uh a lot of the hackers here at the

921
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,159
space are the make magazine

922
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,960
instructables type not the julian

923
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,040
assange hope conference attending type

924
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,679
or even the kind that cares much about a

925
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,119
global movement of hacker spaces

926
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:28,720
i'm not sure what category dildo hacking

927
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,960
falls in for a lot of people diy

928
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,480
has to do with a sort of father-son

929
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,918
nostalgia

930
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:40,000
end quote ah so

931
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:42,560
this is um really interesting

932
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,839
uh because we've got this

933
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,440
acknowledgement

934
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:50,719
of hacking being a variety of things

935
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,119
right and maybe again for some people in

936
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,000
uh european contexts where hacker spaces

937
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,879
are often more

938
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,839
political maybe this make magazine sort

939
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,279
of

940
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:04,000
home project um

941
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,440
personal fabrication uh will be a little

942
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,599
bit

943
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,480
uh unrecognizable or even disappointing

944
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,680
but it is

945
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,000
part of hacking and making in the us

946
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,240
um and then of course there's the you

947
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,280
know information wants to be free

948
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,319
hope conference um you know lock picking

949
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,520
all these kinds of

950
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,880
things uh hacking that he acknowledges

951
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,160
but he he says i'm not sure what dildo

952
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,800
hacking

953
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,240
is maybe suggesting it's not even

954
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,160
hacking at all

955
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,240
uh and then he says for a lot of people

956
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,598
diy has to do with this father-son

957
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,118
nostalgia which i hope

958
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,280
might make you think of the picture i

959
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,800
had up at the very beginning

960
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:48,000
of the father-son with the

961
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,320
radio apparatus um

962
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,599
and so it's really interesting that this

963
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,960
sort of proposal

964
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,599
that these people didn't think of as

965
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,400
being controversial turned into

966
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,200
this you know pretty full-on argument

967
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,680
about

968
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,439
what even hacking is in the sort of

969
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,598
essential way

970
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,960
uh and so here's a reply from one of the

971
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,160
people who

972
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,280
um had proposed the workshop and

973
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,879
she says so my concern here is that it's

974
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,640
a hacker space

975
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,640
initiatives shouldn't be punished

976
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,240
particularly initiative that shakes up

977
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,400
old patterns

978
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,959
our space is really stratifying and the

979
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,359
hardware tinkering is the core interest

980
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,280
and white males as the demographic i'm

981
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,400
really frustrated

982
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,400
uh and quote and so this um again i

983
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,640
assume that this is fairly

984
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,760
uh recognizable to folks right that's

985
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,520
sort of if the core

986
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:44,960
of what hacking is is uh

987
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,359
taking it upon yourself to take

988
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,400
artifacts and practices that you already

989
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,200
know how to

990
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,079
do in a new direction like that's what

991
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,640
hacking is

992
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,280
according to you know a lot of people

993
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,560
and so

994
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,240
she's really surprised and really

995
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,920
dismayed and really i think felt very

996
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,439
hurt and rejected

997
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:07,119
that this was flaring as as controversy

998
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,359
um and you know

999
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,400
was really surprised that people were

1000
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,520
sort of raising

1001
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,040
the prospect that you know dildo hacking

1002
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,040
was this interruption

1003
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:21,520
of a nostalgic uh father-son father-son

1004
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,440
uh tech practice that you know was

1005
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,359
somehow offensive

1006
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,640
um certainly it seems like part of the

1007
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,759
problem might have been

1008
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,759
uh the introduction of sexuality

1009
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,839
um and maybe questions about who's

1010
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,839
sexuality sexuality that didn't seem to

1011
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,920
center straight

1012
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,960
men uh what happened was this didn't get

1013
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,079
resolved

1014
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:45,040
the people who proposed the workshop

1015
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,640
uh to get included women men and

1016
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,400
non-binary people

1017
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:53,759
uh actually left they decamped to a new

1018
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,160
space that was forming that was

1019
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,520
uh forming with more kind of feminist

1020
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,879
hacking principles and

1021
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:03,359
welcomed them there and the first space

1022
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,320
you know stayed how they were and didn't

1023
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,400
have to

1024
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,680
you know keep having conflicts and and

1025
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,839
grapple with

1026
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,799
uh this kind of controversy anymore

1027
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,320
because

1028
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,160
the people and they weren't kicked out

1029
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,320
but they decided to leave

1030
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:21,359
um and so you know

1031
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,760
i know these conflicts have been very

1032
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,359
painful and alienating for people who

1033
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,760
have experienced them

1034
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,359
uh even though maybe the content of this

1035
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,800
one seems almost you know funny or

1036
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:34,000
something in hindsight

1037
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,839
but what i want to propose is that

1038
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,040
part of why this has been so difficult

1039
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,078
for people

1040
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,000
in these spaces

1041
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,160
is that people are actually wrestling

1042
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,079
with this whole legacy

1043
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,359
of division that i laid out in the first

1044
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,240
part of the talk

1045
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,839
so it may feel like you know you're just

1046
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,640
having an argument with

1047
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,200
your you know fellow group members who

1048
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,040
are

1049
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,040
a lot like you but then you're breaking

1050
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,440
down along some kind of

1051
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,839
you know line that you both you know

1052
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,040
can't cross over to with the other one

1053
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:10,880
um but there's a sort of really deep uh

1054
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:14,960
sedimentary layer um of you know

1055
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:18,480
who has been anointed the sort of

1056
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:21,599
um power of agency over tech

1057
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,520
and you know for whom that has been

1058
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,040
sort of a taken for granted tacit

1059
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,880
assumption and who's had to sort of

1060
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,759
assert their presence or their right to

1061
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,520
be there

1062
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,040
in different ways and so when there are

1063
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,839
these you know conflicts and flash

1064
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,759
points

1065
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:36,078
all of that stuff is there and that's

1066
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,520
actually really hard to solve

1067
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,079
anywhere but it's um very very hard to

1068
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,759
solve

1069
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,560
in elective volunteeristic associations

1070
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,880
i think also

1071
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,560
so not not to say impossible but like

1072
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,240
there's a reason these conflicts are

1073
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,680
difficult um okay so returning to

1074
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,359
diversity

1075
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,480
um and this is the same quote i won't

1076
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:01,920
read it again

1077
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,960
but the you know sort of idea that

1078
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,599
women in tech are there to

1079
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,359
bring forward different experiences and

1080
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,000
build a better product

1081
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,200
you know diversity is maybe necessary to

1082
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,920
start these conversations

1083
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,720
with the idea of diversity but i don't

1084
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,000
think it's

1085
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:23,040
sufficient for the purposes here it's

1086
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,839
too easily you know sitting alongside

1087
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,599
market values which i think are not what

1088
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,279
people in hackerspaces are primarily

1089
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,560
most interested in

1090
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,200
and that's not really why they're there

1091
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,359
and it's also very easily steered away

1092
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,879
from the important political work

1093
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:42,240
that i think people in hacking

1094
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,359
communities often want to do

1095
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,919
it can sort of mutate into this you know

1096
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,598
contradictory thing where you've got

1097
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,800
sort of market values on the one hand

1098
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,520
and something

1099
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,720
that isn't what you set out to do on the

1100
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,000
other hand and

1101
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,759
i'm going to illustrate that with this

1102
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,720
somewhat more provocative example this

1103
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,240
is a

1104
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,919
a meme i stole from the internet um

1105
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,640
but the point here is that you can make

1106
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,920
these diversity affirming slogans you

1107
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,960
know here we've got

1108
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,160
black lives matter and yes we can and

1109
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,839
lgbt

1110
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:18,399
uh sort of flags or slogans

1111
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,480
on a bomber right you can make these

1112
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,560
diversity affirming slogans fit

1113
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,520
within a system that is fundamentally

1114
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,799
violent

1115
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,079
carceral militarized it doesn't

1116
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,960
necessarily challenge

1117
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,000
the system itself to bring forward

1118
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,240
individuals

1119
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,119
identities as members of marginalized

1120
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,118
groups

1121
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,400
in fact capitalism is actually quite

1122
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,119
happy to resolve

1123
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,200
what might seem like contradiction here

1124
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,079
by commodifying identity

1125
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,839
selling it as a brand without resolving

1126
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,920
the fundamental tensions that we know

1127
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:52,799
that are here that have to do with

1128
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,640
social power and dominance and

1129
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,280
exploitation

1130
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:00,480
um so coming back to the free software

1131
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,480
quote from the beginning

1132
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,279
as i said this sort of hit consensus uh

1133
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,799
but i'm actually going to argue it's not

1134
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,280
really going far enough

1135
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,040
diverse participation and making

1136
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,920
proprietary software extinct

1137
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,319
are fine but i think they actually do

1138
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,520
not

1139
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:19,440
fully capture what's at stake in

1140
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,359
these again very tough conversations

1141
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,040
that have been happening in hacking and

1142
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:28,640
free software groups um

1143
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:31,440
and so you know we might think of this

1144
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,598
as again a point of entry but we might

1145
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,040
want to take it a bit farther

1146
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,040
and this is as far as i'll go with

1147
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,480
prescriptions or how to

1148
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:44,160
so specific in uh local

1149
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,800
voluntaristic communities you know that

1150
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,960
are either

1151
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,000
your hackerspace in the city you live in

1152
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,400
or the

1153
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,839
the project that you that's distributed

1154
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,119
but that you work on

1155
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:56,560
so articulate values and politics uh

1156
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,480
diversity is a good one

1157
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,880
but i'm going to say it's necessary and

1158
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,800
not sufficient

1159
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,920
and some of the things i talk about in

1160
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,960
the book include like

1161
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:10,160
other forms of political

1162
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:13,359
beliefs like decolonization or

1163
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,640
attention to militarism uh that can

1164
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,720
actually sort of force you

1165
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,839
to have sometimes harder conversations

1166
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,839
but ones that

1167
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:24,880
can clarify uh values and goals

1168
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:25,279
obviously i don't need to tell um you

1169
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,040
know

1170
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,720
hacking groups but keep theorizing and

1171
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,359
keep experimenting

1172
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,640
uh that is a way you know whether it's

1173
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,359
crypto dancing or not

1174
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,078
it's a way to sort of like walk yourself

1175
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,480
through

1176
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,119
um what you're trying to sort of build

1177
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,880
and iterate uh and within space

1178
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,400
within spaces i think at this point this

1179
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,839
is fairly uncontroversial but i do

1180
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,720
chronicle in the book how people got

1181
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,279
here

1182
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,240
making and enforcing rules having

1183
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,800
conversations

1184
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,680
sometimes one-on-one right not a sort of

1185
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,800
public

1186
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:00,160
conflagration flame war but um

1187
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,680
you know if people feel safe you know

1188
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,399
respect each other enough to actually

1189
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,279
talk through uh what is

1190
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,000
the sort of point of contention or or

1191
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,599
difference and see

1192
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,880
if you can um understand one another

1193
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,400
the other thing i want to point out

1194
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,440
though is that there's a whole lot of

1195
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,480
stuff going on

1196
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,400
here that is much much bigger than the

1197
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:24,480
spaces and communities that you're in

1198
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:27,119
and so it is kind of a mistake and

1199
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,680
no one's fault that you can't solve all

1200
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,040
of this

1201
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:33,759
in the groups uh that you're in and so

1202
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,520
there also has to be much bigger uh

1203
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,240
society-wide goals

1204
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,960
that we you know all have our eyes on

1205
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,000
because

1206
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,880
if we solved some of this stuff then lo

1207
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,640
and behold

1208
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,319
diversity in tech would be a lot easier

1209
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,839
and and probably less fraught and

1210
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:50,160
contentious

1211
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:51,440
but things like demilitarization supply

1212
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,598
chain justice

1213
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:58,560
basic social equity workplace fairness

1214
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,680
uh public reconciliation i'm giving u.s

1215
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,560
examples here

1216
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,598
reparations land back and obviously the

1217
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,640
one that's

1218
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:09,119
coming for all of us climate

1219
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,480
is going to be you know the biggest

1220
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,680
problem it already is the biggest

1221
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,880
problem in terms of

1222
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:18,000
you know racial and uh economic

1223
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,960
and um environmental justice worldwide

1224
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,880
so in conclusion um my little take home

1225
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,880
slogan is that there's no hack or tech

1226
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,119
audit for justice

1227
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,640
but there are these different levels and

1228
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,520
you know you can work on one

1229
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,000
and work on another but you can't solve

1230
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,119
the really

1231
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,960
big stuff um in the sort of tech domain

1232
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,960
and that's not that's not a shortcoming

1233
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,000
and it's not for lack of trying

1234
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,800
um that is all i'm very happy to quit

1235
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,079
talking so much

1236
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,200
and move to q a thank you so much for

1237
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,640
your attention

1238
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:53,439
thanks all right thank you

1239
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,319
thank you um all right everyone

1240
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,520
questions

1241
00:45:54,319 --> 00:46:01,279
on twitter mastodon rc3

1242
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:03,839
2 on isc um

1243
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,400
we will wait for a little bit and ask

1244
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:09,200
the question in the meantime so this

1245
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,319
research for this book when when did you

1246
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,520
actually do it

1247
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:16,880
like time wise yeah um

1248
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,839
it started it actually we were talking

1249
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,440
before

1250
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,119
we had an audience a little bit about

1251
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,119
radio and

1252
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,400
my earlier project was about people

1253
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,839
building radio stations

1254
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:29,599
and try to be brief but they had a very

1255
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,359
emancipatory

1256
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,800
set of ideas about what it meant to

1257
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:34,480
teach people how to

1258
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,240
build electronics or solder a

1259
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,400
transmitter board or something

1260
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,560
but they kept running into some of these

1261
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:44,160
patterns of exclusion

1262
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:45,440
that i mentioned um and so it was

1263
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,520
actually through them

1264
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,640
that i heard about these conversations

1265
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,800
that were starting to happen

1266
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,078
in in hacking and open source

1267
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,319
communities

1268
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,440
where people were trying to you know

1269
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,880
directly head on

1270
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,839
confront some of this stuff so i think i

1271
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,880
heard about it around the 2006 era

1272
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:05,680
um started working on it maybe

1273
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,599
it's about 2010 to about 2015 it's the

1274
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,919
period that i was actively

1275
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,800
you know going to conferences and

1276
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,440
meetups and

1277
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,800
spaces and interviewing people so it's

1278
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,760
this sort of snapshot

1279
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,160
um yeah that's the shortest answer

1280
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,359
thanks

1281
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,200
all right that's very interesting

1282
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:23,200
because like i

1283
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,680
kept thinking if you had encountered

1284
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,040
this sort of the rise of the alt right

1285
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,359
or something like this because i feel

1286
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,200
like

1287
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:31,040
in the last couple of years like these

1288
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,118
discussions have just become

1289
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,640
so much more radicalized and not from

1290
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,319
the left but from the right

1291
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,640
like where you can basically no longer

1292
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:41,119
talk about this without just

1293
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,799
all hell breaking loose right i think

1294
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,680
that's a really interesting

1295
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,440
point and i think you're right this does

1296
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,520
i mean i was finishing the book

1297
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,440
during the trump era over here and i

1298
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,040
know you've got your own counterparts in

1299
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,119
europe

1300
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,880
but this is all very much within a kind

1301
00:47:55,119 --> 00:48:00,640
of obama

1302
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,839
liberal neoliberal framing and actually

1303
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,400
something i wrote about

1304
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:06,880
i think is in the intro of the book is

1305
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:10,160
the obama white house had a

1306
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,760
women in stem as part of a women in

1307
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,598
people of color and stem as part of a

1308
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,960
kind of national

1309
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:19,680
security and a nationalist agenda

1310
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,359
basically on their page and the trump

1311
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,640
administration took it down

1312
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,960
so i think and also in the book there's

1313
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,118
a

1314
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:32,880
discussion of a channel for

1315
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:35,359
polish python users

1316
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,640
where they were like fretting about how

1317
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,799
to ban nazis

1318
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,960
from the channel and whether nazis were

1319
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:44,640
just people showing up and throwing

1320
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,160
um swastikas all over the irc channel

1321
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,359
whether that was trolling

1322
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:51,200
or whether it was real nazis and yes i

1323
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,960
think the sort of stakes of some of this

1324
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:57,439
has gotten a lot

1325
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:59,839
more stark um

1326
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,880
and and so in certain ways the sort of

1327
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:04,078
which side are you on

1328
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:07,520
questions are easier uh but the sort of

1329
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,400
depth of what's at stake and what's

1330
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,280
being defended

1331
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,920
is is maybe harder so yeah the political

1332
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,280
context

1333
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:18,319
is or the sort of temporal is is really

1334
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,280
is part of this yeah all right

1335
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:23,599
now return to the isc have you looked

1336
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,319
into the woman in floss as perhaps being

1337
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,720
one with

1338
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:29,119
predominantly engineers as mother slash

1339
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:33,040
fathers

1340
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:35,440
um sorry could you repeat women

1341
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,279
i think the question is whether you have

1342
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,800
sort of noticed a pattern that women

1343
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,359
that get into these spaces

1344
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,880
uh sort of by their parents have

1345
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:46,720
encountered engineering

1346
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:50,480
i think as a familiar context

1347
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:54,319
i yes i have not personally

1348
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:57,280
uh done research on that but it does

1349
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:57,680
um other you know sort of historical and

1350
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,440
more

1351
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:05,520
and sociological research shows that

1352
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,760
uh people with um who are exposed

1353
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,119
you know at a young age that that's part

1354
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:14,400
of the differential

1355
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:17,440
um and even even in households where

1356
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,720
say a computer came home early on

1357
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,359
we're talking about a slightly older

1358
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,839
generation a computer came home early on

1359
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,000
because

1360
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:26,078
you know parents brought it into the

1361
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,200
house

1362
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:31,359
you know boys were more likely to sort

1363
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,919
of claim it as theirs or take time on it

1364
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,078
or start

1365
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,119
playing with it even a couple or a few

1366
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,200
years earlier than

1367
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,880
girls and so yeah i haven't looked at

1368
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,040
that those sort of life

1369
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,880
narratives directly but other people

1370
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,079
have and i draw on that and that's also

1371
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,119
something

1372
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,559
i am hearing now you know from people

1373
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,160
who are adults

1374
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:55,200
and are thinking about these problems

1375
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:58,319
and how they want to not have their

1376
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,759
own kids encounter the same problems or

1377
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:01,279
sort of legacy of division you

1378
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,280
definitely hear people saying you know i

1379
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,079
want this to get solved so my daughter

1380
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,359
doesn't have a hard time um but that's

1381
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,200
that's a little outside of what i've

1382
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:12,240
looked at but it feeds in

1383
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,839
yeah all right all right this is a

1384
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,720
slightly longer question i'll try to do

1385
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:16,480
my best

1386
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,078
um i've witnessed a lot of white

1387
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,839
feminism in

1388
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,000
foss so that's free open source software

1389
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:25,839
right

1390
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:29,040
and for diversity equity and inclusions

1391
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:32,078
dei spaces is intersectionality

1392
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:34,319
sufficiently recognized as an issue

1393
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,400
in fast feminism or is it actually worse

1394
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:39,680
off due to the low number of women

1395
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:43,119
in free reinforce around two percent

1396
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:45,680
great yeah so i couldn't um

1397
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,319
at first i will flag that the numbers in

1398
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,240
foss have

1399
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,599
started to change there's later research

1400
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:53,598
that shows that they're up

1401
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:55,280
some um the question about

1402
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,000
white feminism is a really good one and

1403
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:01,200
i do write in the book about people sort

1404
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,200
of grappling with that

1405
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:09,520
and so the sort of

1406
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,720
trajectory was the first category

1407
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:16,000
that people started to notice

1408
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:19,520
uh of exclusion was women

1409
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,040
and uh i think i discuss

1410
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:25,759
how women

1411
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,119
opened up pretty quickly to being

1412
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,680
non-essentialist and

1413
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,359
again inclusive of trans and non-binary

1414
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:34,720
sorts of identities

1415
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:37,119
but i think that the race and the

1416
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,558
what i sometimes talk about is sort of

1417
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,559
global positioning

1418
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:43,280
you know global north hackers in europe

1419
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:46,640
and north america

1420
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:50,000
it is harder i think for them to sort of

1421
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:53,279
deal uh as head-on

1422
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,960
with um you know

1423
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,800
race and i mean these are fundamentally

1424
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,960
questions of racial capitalism

1425
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:03,680
and so being uh positioned within

1426
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,359
fairly well advantage you know global

1427
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,399
north communities

1428
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:09,680
uh it is harder to

1429
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,040
confront some of those issues i think

1430
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,399
there's a consciousness of it but i

1431
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,520
would say it's a lot

1432
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:18,319
what i observed was a lot greater uh

1433
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:21,839
awareness and sort of development of

1434
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:26,079
potential solutions for um

1435
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:28,000
being inclusive of women than

1436
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,359
you know a sort of really broadly

1437
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,720
intersectional notion

1438
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:34,960
of women including people in

1439
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:36,480
uh global south positions and in

1440
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,440
racialized categories in the global

1441
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,240
north

1442
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,800
and i again i think i think there's been

1443
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,118
a sort of

1444
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,720
probably shift in attention to that some

1445
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:48,000
of which post

1446
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:51,118
post dates the period in the book um

1447
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,200
but i also think that that is

1448
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:55,520
it's uniquely hard i think to solve in

1449
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,558
voluntaristic groups because the forces

1450
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:00,240
at least in the u.s um and i would

1451
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,680
speculate in europe as well like the

1452
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:05,680
forces

1453
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:08,960
that cause inequality and segregation

1454
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,960
and you know

1455
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,240
like the the tech industry is a really

1456
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,160
good place to see these contradictions

1457
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,558
like what's going on now with like

1458
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,279
you know google and the firing of doctor

1459
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,720
tim

1460
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,720
jibru is

1461
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,400
you know places where there's a sort of

1462
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,759
capitalistic

1463
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,760
um incentive

1464
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,599
are not going to be able to solve these

1465
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,439
problems of inequality because the

1466
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,160
profit motive is always going to be

1467
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,280
there

1468
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:40,558
to build surveillance tech to

1469
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:44,400
assist you know countries and

1470
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:46,400
um you know that are that want to build

1471
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,920
prisons again this is what's coming with

1472
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:51,599
with climate stuff

1473
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:53,280
uh and so saying oh you need to hire

1474
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:55,119
you know more black women or something

1475
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,559
is like running smack into these

1476
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,319
contradictions and this is part of why i

1477
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:01,520
say this really can't be solved within

1478
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:02,799
tech um and these are very big thorny

1479
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,000
issues another thing the final thing

1480
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,480
i'll point out

1481
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,559
this is sort of rambling is for a

1482
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:11,200
volunteeristic group

1483
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:13,119
it's it's going to be easier to make

1484
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,118
fairly small interventions and so i

1485
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,799
think that that's

1486
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,839
i actually have somebody talking about

1487
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:21,040
this like if we make the space more

1488
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:23,279
inclusive to anybody

1489
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,359
and say you know bad behavior isn't here

1490
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:28,720
or isn't welcome here

1491
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:31,200
um you know that can hit

1492
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,558
a note where it might cause there to be

1493
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,680
a sort of more inclusive community that

1494
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,960
would be welcoming to a bunch of

1495
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:38,319
different kinds of folks

1496
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:40,960
but it's not necessarily realistic to

1497
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:42,640
tailor uh in a volunteristic group

1498
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,480
that's small

1499
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,839
a response to the sort of forms of

1500
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,000
exclusion

1501
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,200
all the kinds of different people have

1502
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,680
experienced

1503
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,598
and so again i think of this as kind of

1504
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,118
a question of scale

1505
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,160
but i really do think that the sort of

1506
00:55:55,119 --> 00:56:00,839
way that voluntaristic groups i.e not

1507
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:03,598
the market not workplaces

1508
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:04,319
articulate you know what they think the

1509
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,319
problems are

1510
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:08,000
and what they can you know how they can

1511
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:09,920
sort of begin to talk about solutions

1512
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,520
are really important precisely because

1513
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:15,119
they're not

1514
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:16,960
uh hamstrung by the same contradictions

1515
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,680
that for-profit

1516
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,880
spaces are that was a long it's a really

1517
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:24,240
great question i do

1518
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,440
take it up some uh the people i was

1519
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,118
writing about i think we're starting to

1520
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,960
take it up some it's probably more

1521
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:32,079
full-throated now

1522
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:34,640
and it's very complicated

1523
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:36,000
yes all of these things yeah all right

1524
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:39,839
we have an interesting question

1525
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,119
would you advise people to try to change

1526
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:44,480
communities from within

1527
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:47,200
or just start new structures with more

1528
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,960
intersectional spaces i don't have a

1529
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:54,319
great answer to that i think it's

1530
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:54,319
um it is kind of the

1531
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,000
pressing question of the day i think in

1532
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,799
a lot

1533
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,799
of uh

1534
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:05,200
a lot of spaces and i

1535
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,279
i i see good answers on both sides and i

1536
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,640
think it

1537
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:16,319
um depends perhaps

1538
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:19,520
um i do see a virtue in

1539
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:22,558
some space being set aside um

1540
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:24,559
but how that

1541
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:27,040
you know separate space chooses to

1542
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:30,960
interface with a sort of wider space

1543
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:32,640
is um going to vary and i don't think

1544
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,400
i don't think it's necessarily a binary

1545
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,200
like you're either totally outside or

1546
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,000
you're

1547
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,040
within having a you know a big

1548
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,599
discussion about

1549
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,720
how to be maximally inclusive um you

1550
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,799
know i think those things are always

1551
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,720
kind of dialogically

1552
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,880
you know happening but i've seen people

1553
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:51,839
argue both sides of it and i've seen

1554
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,880
i think compelling answers on both sides

1555
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:57,119
of it

1556
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:58,079
um but yeah it is kind of the place

1557
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,720
where the

1558
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:03,040
idea that we're sort of all taking up

1559
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:06,640
this project together

1560
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:08,000
can start to you know break down and

1561
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,879
some people think you're really losing

1562
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,440
a lot of people go off and and stop you

1563
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,880
know

1564
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:18,480
working together as some sort of um

1565
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,920
unified uh group and so

1566
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,760
yeah i don't i don't have a great answer

1567
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,640
that i do write about it in the book and

1568
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,240
i would say

1569
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,920
it depends on what the goals are i think

1570
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,839
having some separate space is probably

1571
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,160
important in any event

1572
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:31,920
yeah it seems like these like these kind

1573
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,680
of hacker spaces have

1574
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,119
at least the advantage of being able to

1575
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,598
accommodate like sort of

1576
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:39,680
sub groups right so you can have these

1577
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,839
certain events or these certain working

1578
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,919
groups that can focus on these issues

1579
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:46,078
for example i think our host today the

1580
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,160
exxon hackers base in berlin

1581
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:49,680
i just they they started this talk

1582
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,759
series president

1583
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:54,399
which is just talks below the tree they

1584
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,920
have a led tree in there hacker space

1585
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,440
and it just sort of naturally happened

1586
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,280
that it would had only women as speakers

1587
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,040
and it was just this lovely

1588
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,960
natural evolution of just having much

1589
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,520
more interesting topics and not just

1590
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,880
you know the traditional male hacker

1591
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,319
kind of topics

1592
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,000
so i think it's really cool when you

1593
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:11,920
just have these ability to have these

1594
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,440
initiatives inside existing spaces

1595
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:19,040
somehow

1596
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:21,359
right just a rant from my side um

1597
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:23,200
or someone had a question the title of

1598
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,319
the book is just hacking diversity right

1599
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,118
i think we mentioned this at the

1600
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:29,200
beginning yeah i think the whole title

1601
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,640
yeah if you look for hacking diversity

1602
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:34,319
you'll find it my name

1603
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:37,040
princeton university press yeah nice

1604
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:38,319
oh and i'll i'll be shameless and say

1605
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:41,359
it's on very deep

1606
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:43,759
sale right now if you were to buy it

1607
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:44,880
from princeton directly there's a

1608
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,640
discount code

1609
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:51,680
and it's on my twitter it's

1610
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:54,319
i think it's h d e v s

1611
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,879
anyway it's 40 off through like february

1612
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:58,640
but

1613
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:00,640
nice yeah it's very affordable

1614
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,799
can you comment on how structures like

1615
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,558
github that predominantly value code

1616
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:06,559
submissions and other highly formalized

1617
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:08,240
tasks over community building and less

1618
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:11,280
technical contributions

1619
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:15,520
play into this nexus yes

1620
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:18,720
absolutely i mean historically um

1621
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:20,640
the focus on

1622
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:22,078
you know the artifact what you get

1623
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:25,440
produced the code

1624
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:28,160
even hardware has taken on this sort of

1625
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:30,960
exalted uh

1626
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:33,359
symbolic meaning and it has definitely

1627
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,839
contributed to both the denigration and

1628
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:37,440
the

1629
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:41,200
invisibility of people who weren't doing

1630
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:43,920
that kind of work and who might be doing

1631
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,720
community building or even you know

1632
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,040
things

1633
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,160
documentation or translation right with

1634
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,839
it's being global

1635
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:53,279
practices um that the sort of

1636
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:55,200
authors of the code are getting this

1637
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:57,280
sort of you know

1638
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,558
priesthood status and everyone else is

1639
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,799
sort of lower

1640
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:03,760
um i think again awareness of that is

1641
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:03,759
starting to change but

1642
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:08,160
it's definitely contributed to again the

1643
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:09,040
historical

1644
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,640
sense that there was

1645
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,200
under-representation of some kinds of

1646
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:16,960
folks

1647
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:19,520
um and i think there are ways you can

1648
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,640
i mean it sort of starts with uh raising

1649
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,799
awareness of this

1650
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,720
um but again that sort of signal the

1651
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:28,079
celebration of the

1652
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:29,919
the technologist is is coming in

1653
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:31,440
from all these other places in the

1654
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:34,799
culture and so

1655
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,200
uh deprogramming that or something as it

1656
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:38,559
were

1657
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:40,640
is um is tough but not impossible and

1658
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:42,160
again i i see that

1659
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,960
i see that actually at least here as

1660
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:48,558
part of a sort of bigger culture war

1661
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:50,400
um and you know the idea that this sort

1662
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:53,520
of tech is the

1663
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,400
you know godly apparatus and everything

1664
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,759
else is

1665
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:59,599
you know humanities and squishy

1666
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,280
soft stuff we don't need that's gonna

1667
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:05,359
you know fall away

1668
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:07,680
um yeah it's it doesn't have to be

1669
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:09,359
as big of a topic as that but that's

1670
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,598
again it's all kind of in there

1671
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:13,038
um like i don't know if that answered a

1672
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,319
question but yes that's there

1673
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:16,319
and i think that's something that the

1674
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:19,038
first step in

1675
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:19,359
addressing it can be acknowledging it

1676
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:22,640
and

1677
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:23,440
and building um forms of collaboration

1678
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,359
and

1679
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:28,240
that are not just sort of like nominally

1680
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:30,319
non-hierarchical but specifically

1681
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,520
raising visibility and sort of credit

1682
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:34,799
giving uh to

1683
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:35,920
other kinds of contributions so do you

1684
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:37,680
feel like someone that

1685
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,760
is actually a science and technology

1686
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,520
scholar that this field has

1687
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,359
like is finally getting recognized as

1688
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,559
something that exists and is real

1689
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,319
because i always have this impression

1690
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:48,079
that people just assume this doesn't

1691
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:50,079
exist or no one thinks about this except

1692
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:51,359
them and there's an entire academic

1693
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:54,160
field about it

1694
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:55,680
do you think this is changing or is it

1695
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,319
just

1696
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,640
the same as always i don't know i mean i

1697
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:02,640
think that there's a

1698
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,759
there's a lot of visibility on the one

1699
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:07,279
hand

1700
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,280
um and even

1701
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:12,480
you know something in the u.s with

1702
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:15,039
and who knows what will be happening

1703
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,039
after kovid but you know public school

1704
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:19,280
systems were

1705
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:20,960
having their budgets cut after the first

1706
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,760
financial crisis

1707
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:25,119
in 2008 and one of the things that was

1708
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,960
being proposed was you know

1709
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:29,599
moving a hacker space into a high school

1710
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:32,720
and sort of having that

1711
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:34,880
you know come forward and

1712
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,319
do things that institutions had maybe

1713
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:39,359
once been doing

1714
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:41,279
um i think that

1715
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:43,520
again i'll keep coming back to the

1716
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:46,400
tension between

1717
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:48,640
what i think some of the most

1718
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:51,839
interesting

1719
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:54,720
volunteeristic and politicized sort of

1720
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:56,558
goals for these kinds of activities

1721
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,640
them versus what the market wants them

1722
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:02,000
to do

1723
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:05,038
are our sort of intention

1724
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,480
and there was a moment where i was

1725
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:09,760
interviewing someone maybe

1726
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:12,160
in i want to say 2012 and i was asking

1727
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:14,799
him questions about free software

1728
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:16,240
and he was very kind but he said

1729
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:18,559
something like why are you asking me

1730
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:20,720
about free software like that's dead

1731
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:21,680
you know what we mean open like open

1732
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:24,558
source one

1733
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:25,279
sort of um and i'm not the only person

1734
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:28,799
who's written

1735
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:31,520
about that at all um

1736
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:32,880
but i think the sort of idea that

1737
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:35,038
there's something here that can't just

1738
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,039
be

1739
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:40,880
you know co-opted by a market like

1740
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:44,319
that's the hard part um

1741
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,599
and i mean i think there is a lot of

1742
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:46,720
there's continuing to be a lot of

1743
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:49,680
attention to you know

1744
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,799
hackathons and coding boot camps and

1745
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:55,520
these kinds of things

1746
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:57,038
um but

1747
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,799
i don't know i guess i'm sort of too

1748
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:59,760
inside and outside at the same time to

1749
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:01,200
have a good answer i

1750
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,520
i think that there's a well-established

1751
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:07,118
body of like scholarly recognition

1752
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:09,119
of these activities um

1753
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:10,799
i think people look at me less weird

1754
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,760
talking about this than a book about

1755
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:15,359
radio

1756
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:20,319
in the 21st century um

1757
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:22,160
but i think the sort of you know

1758
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:24,640
really sustained work to sort of dis

1759
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:27,359
articulate or disentangle

1760
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:29,118
um some of this from industry where it's

1761
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:30,558
getting the sort of most

1762
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:32,400
not just attention but the sort of most

1763
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:34,000
celebration and and the ways that that

1764
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,720
can kind of

1765
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,440
uh distort i think some of the other

1766
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,480
intentions

1767
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:42,559
that is is always going to be tough

1768
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,640
all right wonderful i think we're out of

1769
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:47,920
time so thank you very much

1770
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:49,279

1771
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,640
