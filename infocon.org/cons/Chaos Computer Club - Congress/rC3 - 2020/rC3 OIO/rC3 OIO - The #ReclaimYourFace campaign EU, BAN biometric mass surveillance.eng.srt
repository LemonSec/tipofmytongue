00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,439
and while many voices from the police to

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,439
governments call for widespread video

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,439
surveillance

broad coalition of 14 european

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,120
organizations calls for the opposite

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,079
a ban of facial and other biometric

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,680
recommend

12
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,000
recognition systems in public spaces

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,000
the next talk is about these efforts and

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,239

and explain what you can do to support

30

so good morning good evening or good day

32

everyone we don't know when this is

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,079
being broadcasted

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,119
yet but this is the reclaim your face

35
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,158
talk

36
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,920
for this year's congress

37
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,960
and we wanted to start with an

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,680
imagination exercise

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,759
imagine you're in a public space uh what

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,680
do you do in this public space

41
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,759
you're probably walking you're on your

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,399
way to work or to your house to grab a

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,240
beer

44
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,399
or you're just walking for the sake of

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,000
it you might be meeting a friend to hang

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,119
around in the park or

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,119
some people for a demo um maybe you're

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,680
in a public square and you just decided

49
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,840
to join some folks for a random concert

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,320
that spontaneously just

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,319
started because some folks had their

52
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,560
guitars around

53
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,160
the point is that public spaces are

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,160
spaces for communities

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,680
their platform for group dialogue and

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,520
civic action

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,120
there's spaces where we can really

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,879
exercise our freedoms

59
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,080
be it our freedom to gather in an

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,480
assembly to speak out against injustices

61
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,920
or the freedom to document and record

62
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,720
abuses

63
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,399
public spaces are the areas where we

64
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,280
want to be treated

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,000
fairly and not discriminated against

66
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,560
because of how

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,760
we look how we walk what we wear or who

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,480
we kiss

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,280
public spaces allow us to decide

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,518
ourselves

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,560
how we want to be seen by others and

72
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,239
have the autonomy

73
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,959
over what actions we take

74
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,599
however the introduction of biometric

75
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,920
mass surveillance into our public spaces

76
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,879
is threatening our communities our

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,518
freedoms

78
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,000
our autonomy and the very expectation

79
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,480
one has to be treated fairly

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,480
when we say biometrics we mean any type

81
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,159
of data that relates to your body or

82
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,959
your behavior

83
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,159
biometric data is sensitive data under

84
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,720
eu law

85
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,760
what better idea than to combine this

86
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,319
sensitive data

87
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,000
with an unlawful practice mass

88
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,720
surveillance

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,280
mass surveillance is any monitoring

90
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,599
tracking

91
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,200
and otherwise processing of data of

92
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,480
individuals or groups in an

93
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,720
indiscriminate

94
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:38,480
or a randomly targeted manner

95
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,599
our qualities behaviors emotions

96
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,480
characteristics are used against us our

97
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,679
dignity is

98
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,959
under threat people are objectified

99
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,959
commodified dehumanized

100
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,200
the use of these technologies like

101
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,680
facial recognition

102
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,839
are manipulative for example coercing

103
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,120
people into avoiding certain places or

104
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,560
events

105
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,400
the problems with biometric mass

106
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,799
surveillance are many from being

107
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,959
constantly monitored to being treated by

108
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,040
your government like a potential suspect

109
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,159
being discriminated against because you

110
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,000
have a certain color

111
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,439
religious accessory or because you're

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,160
holding the hand of the

113
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,000
wrong partner biometric mass

114
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,040
surveillance technology such as live

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,199
facial recognition

116
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,880
is being deployed in european public

117
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,680
spaces every day

118
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,159
in secret with no evidence behind the

119
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,479
need

120
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,400
of such deployment with no respect for

121
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,680
our right or for our dignity

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,919
in the public space this is why

123
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,720
the reclaim your face movement is

124
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,198
calling for

125
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,840
a ban on biometric surveillance in

126
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,840
european public spaces

127
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:50,320
we are a coalition of organizations

128
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,320
across europe as well as organizations

129
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,800
with international reach such as article

136
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,919
today i'm joined by my colleagues ella

in the next hour or so we will give you

143
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,400
an update on how the eu legal

144
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,799
landscape is looking like we will zoom

145
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,758
in

146
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,560
on the mobilization in greece serbia and

147
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,880
italy

148
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,680
and we will discuss how you can help out

149
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,560
if you're as concerned as we are

150
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,680
i'll hand it in now to ella my colleague

151
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,360
will give a

152
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,840
intro into how the eu law landscape is

153
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,840
looking like

154
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,520
thanks andrea so what are things looking

155
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,039
like for

156
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,280
biometrics in europe well the eu

157
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,560
has actually been developing rules on

158
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,318
biometrics since

159
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,400
as early as 2004 and parts of the edgery

160
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,319
network have been advocating for

161
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,318
just as long to make sure that this is

162
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,360
done in a way that's lawful

163
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,639
and that respects people's rights so

164
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,919
probably most notably

165
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,400
in 2018 the now world famous

166
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,680
general data protection regulation or

167
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,919
gdpr

168
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,520
as well as its lesser known counterpart

169
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,198
for police purposes

170
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,799
called the data protection law

171
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,919
enforcement directive

172
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,120
both came into force and these rules

173
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,840
explained for

174
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,919
really the first time in european law

175
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,400
what biometric data actually

176
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,919
are and they also established the

177
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,638
principle of a ban

178
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,599
on their youth so specifically this

179
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,560
meant that the

180
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,199
processing of sensitive biometric data

181
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,319
was now

182
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,479
forbidden in eu law but

183
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,360
there are a number of really broad

184
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,840
exceptions

185
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,840
and loopholes to this ban which has

186
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,960
opened the door to deployments which

187
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,679
have really clearly

188
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,599
violated people's rights and freedoms

189
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,479
and it's been a really similar story

190
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,319
in non-eu european countries like serbia

191
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,240
too

192
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,240
so in february or march of 2021

193
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,319
we're expecting that the european

194
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,840
commission will propose a new

195
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,120
and potentially quite groundbreaking law

196
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,479
for how the eu

197
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,039
will regulate artificial intelligence

198
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,520
this law will likely have ramifications

199
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,919
on

200
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,039
other european countries and probably

201
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,080
the rest of the world

202
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,880
in terms of the standards that it sets

203
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,880
and it's likely to include rules on the

204
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,000
use of what the commission calls

205
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,319
remote facial recognition but we call

206
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,880
that

207
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,800
a form of biometric mass surveillance

208
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,639
and there are many other forms of

209
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,400
biometric mass surveillance out there

210
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,039
too

211
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,039
over a year ago there was actually a

212
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,960
leaked draft of a paper

213
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,878
on artificial intelligence which

214
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,960
revealed that at one point

215
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,240
the european commission had actually

216
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,960
considered a

217
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,560
three to five year ban on some uses of

218
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,680
biometric surveillance in

219
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,319
public spaces but ultimately

220
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,840
and very unfortunately they made a

221
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,199
political decision that

222
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,679
so-called innovation and profitability

223
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,199
were more important so we're really

224
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,000
hoping that this time round

225
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,360
when we get this new proposal for a law

226
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,879
early next year

227
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,520
they'll be more aware of their

228
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:29,840
obligations under fundamental rights law

229
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,919
so to quickly give an overview of what's

230
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,519
happening in europe in response and and

231
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,958
what we're doing about this

232
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,839
uh well because our lawmakers and our

233
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,640
politicians

234
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,519
are not yet taking decisive action to

235
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,560
protect

236
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,560
european public spaces democracies

237
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,640
and essential rights and freedoms from

238
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,199
biometric mass surveillance

239
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,040
our coalition is stepping up to demand

240
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,200
that they do so

241
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,599
we've been raising the alarm about the

242
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,760
fact that any use of biometric

243
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,120
surveillance technologies to scan

244
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,240
everyone in public spaces inherently

245
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,040
constitutes a form of mass surveillance

246
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,279
and as a network we've been following

247
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,560
the deployment of these systems in

248
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,040
almost every european country and

249
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,079
after investigating the high levels of

250
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,399
abuse

251
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,800
the harms posed to individuals

252
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,720
communities and society

253
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,359
the resistance to this biometric

254
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,399
surveillance from people across europe

255
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,240
and the emerging global examples of

256
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,640
people's rights and freedoms being

257
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,040
really severely violated as a result

258
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,160
of the use of these technologies we have

259
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,519
decided that

260
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,079
enough is enough over

261
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,120
20 organizations in the reclaim your

262
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,839
face coalition

263
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,399
have been exposing why biometric mass

264
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,000
surveillance is so harmful

265
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,519
and they've been providing strong

266
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,240
evidence for why we need to ban it

267
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,680
we focused on the lack of transparency

268
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,480
and justifications for

269
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,399
existing systems with for example

270
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,120
members of ccc in germany

271
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,880
raising freedom of information and data

272
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,800
subject access requests

273
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,240
for information from authorities and

274
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,160
companies

275
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,680
we've focused on the need for clear

276
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,920
legal limits with

277
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,000
la quadrature dunet in france

278
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,319
successfully litigating against

279
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,760
unlawful uses of facial recognition by

280
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,320
authorities

281
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,959
and across europe we've focused on the

282
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,839
shocking

283
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,640
absence of respect for human dignity

284
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,680
human autonomy and human rights

285
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,680
um so i'm gonna pass over now to three

286
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,719
of the brilliant organizations in the

287
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,959
editorial network

288
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,720
that have been resisting biometric mass

289
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,599
surveillance in their cities and

290
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,360
countries

291
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,519
so that they can share more about what's

292
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,040
been happening specifically in greece

293
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,440
serbia and italy so without further ado

294
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,800
i would like to introduce elepharius

295
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,440
from homo digitalis

296
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,680
in greece i think ricardo is the first

297
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,720
one to go

298
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,120
but i'm sure

299
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,600
reshuffling is not an issue ricardo will

300
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,880
basically detail

301
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,800
the black hole italy is when it comes to

302
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,839
details on the facial recognition used

303
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,839
by police and how local municipalities

304
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,560
are trying to catch up with the latest

305
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,200
innovative

306
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,560
technologies completely disregarding

307
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,800
fundamental human rights

308
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:31,439
ricardo you've got the floor thank you

309
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,920
in the past three four years italy has

310
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,640
seen a slowly but constant introduction

311
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,479
of these

312
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,880
biometric surveillance technologies

313
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,240
ranging from face recognition to

314
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,760
other kind of metadata analysis of

315
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,720
video cameras in this map you can see

316
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,760
three main points of entrance in the

317
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,200
city of cuomo

318
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,120
a festive recognition system was

319
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,480
introduced but later

320
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,959
thanks to the intervention of data

321
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,839
protection authority the system was

322
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,560
stopped

323
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,720
because was deemed illegal the city of

324
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,079
turin and the city of udine they're both

325
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,760
trying to introduce

326
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,599
barometric surveillance systems in the

327
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,920
case of wooden they are specifically

328
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,600
talking about face recognition systems

329
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,399
while in the case of turin they are

330
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,920
talking about a kind of metadata

331
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,200
analysis of the video

332
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,000
that would allow the the police forces

333
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,240
to

334
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,040
monitor the movements of citizens across

335
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,320
the city

336
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,279
and to distinguish if someone is a man

337
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,560
or a woman

338
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:33,120
and to check and detect what kind of

339
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,920
clothes or objects they are carrying on

340
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,399
these are examples of what's going on at

341
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,079
a

342
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,519
local city level when we look instead to

343
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,599
the italian police so

344
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,600
at the national level the scientific

345
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,360
police has bought in 2017

346
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,639
a fist recognition system that can be

347
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,639
used during investigations

348
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,800
just to give some examples of what's

349
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,240
going on what we've done and what the

350
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,399
protection authority has said

351
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,720
in the case of the city of como this is

352
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,320
a summary of an article you can find on

353
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,720
previous international

354
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,680
we wrote in english so we can spread it

355
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,880
around

356
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,800
basically the seed of comma was

357
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,920
approached by huawei in order to

358
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,639
acquire a new innovative system

359
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,800
for uh ensure that the city was more

360
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,120
safe so basically surveillance as a

361
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,399
safety measures but also seen a

362
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,920
solidarity between the citizens

363
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,600
from our investigation from finding

364
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,560
funeral information requests we obtained

365
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,920
documents that

366
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,439
clearly show how the data protection

367
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,399
impact assessment carried out by the

368
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,639
city of cuomo

369
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,680
was basically a field of a seal of

370
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,519
approval uh

371
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,719
meaningless because was done after the

372
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,040
system was acquired

373
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,000
it was basically claiming that face

374
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,480
recognition

375
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,440
equals video surveillance which is not

376
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,880
and for this

377
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,600
for this reason the data protection

378
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,320
authority uh stopped the city of como

379
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,480
from using

380
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,320
this kind of surveillance system video

381
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,000
of face recognition system

382
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,240
and also from the from the documents

383
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,320
we've seen that the huawei the company

384
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,279
involved in this kind of

385
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,639
activity was basically uh pushing for

386
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,519
the introduction of these innovative

387
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,440
technologies

388
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,760
and in the end again the city of como

389
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,440
wasted public money on a system the data

390
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,839
protection authority

391
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,160
say it's lacking a legal basis to be

392
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,279
used

393
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,839
from the from the documents that we

394
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,040
obtained

395
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,680
thanks to the freedom information

396
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,040
request we can see the

397
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,920
other kind of abilities of the

398
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,560
technology that it's being solved by

399
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,560
workbay in this case it's a soft or sort

400
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,959
of metadata analysis so we can see that

401
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,319
the the system in addition to physical

402
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,399
recognition can also

403
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,760
uh track abandoned objects loitering

404
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,000
crowd density

405
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,959
face detection head counting abnormal

406
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,440
speed detection

407
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,079
these are all kind of metadata analysis

408
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,480
that criminalize behavior so basically

409
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,199
there is a if there is a suspicious

410
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,480
behavior

411
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,800
which is like not clearly defined this

412
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,000
system can send an alert this kind of

413
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,760
message analysis

414
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,680
falls within the barometric surveillance

415
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,360
the biometric processing of our data

416
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,199
and it's also something that yeah it's

417
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,880
been installed in the city of turin as i

418
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,760
mentioned before

419
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,240
if we move forward and at the national

420
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,680
level

421
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,680
talking about the system acquired by

422
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,239
italian police this is a screenshot from

423
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,319
the

424
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,079
system being used showed on national

425
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,040
television you can even see the address

426
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,719
of the website

427
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,120
of course this is called and

428
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,800
it consists of two different um aspects

429
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,959
there's a sorry enterprise

430
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,800
which is basically an upgrade to the

431
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,800
manual search that they used to do

432
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,880
in the database of mac shots uh

433
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,519
previously they did this

434
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,959
writing down the details of the suspect

435
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,800
in this case the police can use

436
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,279
a fish recognition system to automate

437
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,479
the process make it more

438
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,399
fast a kind of optimization

439
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,600
and can search images during

440
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,000
investigations

441
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,279
given an image from a cctv camera during

442
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,120
an investigation they can

443
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,120
match this image to see if in the

444
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,959
database

445
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,600
there's someone they know and that

446
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,599
there's a match

447
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,560
as andrea was mentioning in italy the

448
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,000
black hole regarding this information

449
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,160
this is the fact that when we ask

450
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,680
questions regarding this database

451
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,319
we don't know uh how many people are in

452
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,560
there

453
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,399
the overall number is two million images

454
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,680
of italian citizens and seven million

455
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,040
images on foreigners

456
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,359
but when it comes to these foreign

457
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,759
citizens it's not clear if they are

458
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,839
citizens from other european countries

459
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,480
or migrants and assignment seekers we

460
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,920
know for sure

461
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,519
they're in there because the office

462
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,599
database this is the name of

463
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,880
the database used from for this space

464
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,279
recognition system

465
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,160
is a database that includes also

466
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,279
fingerprints

467
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,719
of people so if you are required to

468
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,920
give your fingerprint to the italian

469
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,920
police you are included in this database

470
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,599
also there are lacking evaluation of the

471
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,000
algorithm used by the police every time

472
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,199
you ask

473
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,839
information they basically refrain from

474
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,839
giving you

475
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,120
any kind of details in 2018 the italian

476
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,720
distribution authority opened an

477
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,959
investigation on the second

478
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,000
aspect of the saudi phase recognition

479
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,520
system which

480
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,520
is the real-time one so after two years

481
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,959
the investigation is still ongoing and

482
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,959
we don't have any

483
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,000
kind of details regarding the legality

484
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,079
and possibility

485
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,359
for the police to use the real-time

486
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,720
system that was

487
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:23,760
acquired in order to monitor

488
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,319
public manifestations public events

489
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,199
which falls within a kind of biometric

490
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,159
mass surveillance

491
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,160
but we're still waiting

492
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,200
i now leave the floor to philip to

493
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,400
introduce

494
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,400
what's happening in serbia

495
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,000
thanks ricardo hope everyone can hear me

496
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,000
so

497
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,559
as ella said serbia is a non-eu country

498
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,880
so

499
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,799
we are in kind of hybrid regime at the

500
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,080
moment media is controlled

501
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:58,400
freedom is of speech is suppressed so

502
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,320
officially we are leaning towards west

503
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,840
and european union but we have also

504
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,720
strong influence from

505
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,720
east and china on i would say mutual

506
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,679
interests

507
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,799
we are part of the china's belt and road

508
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,080
project among

509
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,000
other 70 countries mostly third world

510
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,080
countries and

511
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,240
we are being probably victims of that

512
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,439
trapped and soft power influence

513
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,799
so uh huawei managed to sell us

514
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,200
a huge infrastructure with around 8 000

515
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,000
facial recognition cameras being

516
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,120
deployed

517
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,720
either on poles in the streets of police

518
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,639
cars as

519
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:41,679
since few days ago and

520
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,799
also there will be body cams on

521
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,799
our police officers so since we are not

522
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,280
into geopolitics we don't care if this

523
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:52,400
is like huawei of or siemens

524
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,600
or some us companies cameras we're just

525
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,720
scared that

526
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:00,639
this is completely unlawful

527
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:03,360
so two years ago our

528
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,360
ministry minister of police said that

529
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,399
there will be no significant street

530
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,479
entrances or

531
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,240
passages between buildings that will not

532
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,760
be covered by cameras

533
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,840
we will know from which entrance and

534
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,720
building the perpetrator came from which

535
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,080
car

536
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,760
so this was kind of shocking to us we

537
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:25,199
started doing research on this we

538
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,360
were sending a lot a lot of

539
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,919
freedom of information access requests

540
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:34,399
we were being denied

541
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:38,559
mostly because they're confidential

542
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:41,840
so we did some uh

543
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:45,520
awesome or open source intelligence

544
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:48,559
research we found a nice case study

545
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,480
about belgrade on huawei's website which

546
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,000
was kind of weird because we didn't get

547
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,520
any information from our government

548
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,120
but we got it from from

549
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,760
chinese website and as soon as we

550
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,879
we published it it was removed from

551
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,640
their website

552
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:10,960
which was kind of interesting so

553
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,720
we analyzed the laws and we were pretty

554
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,760
sure that

555
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,799
that this is unlawful we also found some

556
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,000
other ways to

557
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:23,120
to obtain some information like this one

558
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,360
while the the the cameras were deployed

559
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,719
on the streets

560
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,280
and uh finally we we

561
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,159
we realized that we have to to reach out

562
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:38,000
to the community because

563
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:42,320
we we know that the whole system

564
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,559
uh is really bad for the society and

565
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,360
it's also awful so basically in serbia

566
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,480
we have this

567
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,719
uh data protection law which is kind of

568
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,280
translated gdpr so

569
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,640
so actual purpose was not defined for

570
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,440
this system

571
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,200
and the the necessity was not confirmed

572
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,120
so basically belgrade is not

573
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,240
unsafe city we don't have terrorist

574
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,559
attacks we

575
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,679
don't have much of this low-level crime

576
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,840
so why do we need this kind of system

577
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,080
also data protection impact assessment

578
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,320
was not approved yet but we still

579
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,199
have this whole system being installed

580
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,480
in in belgrade so what do we do next we

581
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,520
start reaching out to

582
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,799
to community this is a a small

583
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,679
exhibition at the art festival we we put

584
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,600
one bench under surveillance and and the

585
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,960
qr codes to our

586
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,000
cute little small website which was

587
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,320
just uh means to to to leave some

588
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,960
contact information for everyone that

589
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:44,000
was interested in joining this fight

590
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,039
so we we basically were promoting it

591
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,320
on on music festivals we

592
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,480
we on hacker events we

593
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,559
printed a lot of these speakers to

594
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,840
promote the website at one point and

595
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,280
went it went wide

596
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,360
viral so actually

597
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,200
a lot of people reached back offering

598
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,639
help in many ways

599
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:11,039
so this was a good sign for us

600
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:13,280
we gathered them in a nice event

601
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,360
we them to do collaborative work in

602
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,399
several domains so basically what we

603
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,678
wanted to do

604
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,159
we had a group for called.txt where

605
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,559
journalists were speedwriting

606
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,200
everything that our citizens needs to

607
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,000
know

608
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,559
we had the pdf group which were legal

609
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,400
guys

610
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:35,520
who were analyzing laws and making some

611
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,960
strategies for this we had the

612
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,918
html group which were web developers and

613
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,240
designers creating this website

614
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,039
we also had tech guides that were

615
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,720
analyzing

616
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:52,400
patents and other resources this was

617
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:56,080
one of the blueprints that came to be

618
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:59,440
something like this so we actually

619
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,120
did a really nice map called the

620
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,240
architecture of the face recognition

621
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,280
system this is

622
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:10,480
yet about to go out but we used

623
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:13,760
understanding of this system to to

624
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,640
and some of its details to to help our

625
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,280
co-citizens understand the issues so

626
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,440
this is

627
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,240
part from our website which actually

628
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,720
explains how this whole system works and

629
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,720
why is it so bad for for the whole

630
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,919
society

631
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,400
so uh finally we had the the

632
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,159
the guys from the local hack club in

633
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,799
belgrade that

634
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,919
helped us deploy the surveillance under

635
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,879
surveillance it's

636
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,240
it's a german um free and open source

637
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,200
application for mapping

638
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,679
cameras so we deployed this and then we

639
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,840
started

640
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,720
the hunt for the cameras as we call it

641
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,360
with with the

642
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,320
with our community in in belgrade in

643
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,039
serbia

644
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,840
we invited people to recognize the

645
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,480
cameras that

646
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,399
recognize themselves so these are the

647
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,120
three most common cameras used in this

648
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,200
system

649
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,918
we set up the twitter profile which

650
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,000
became uh instantly popular people were

651
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,320
sending us photos from the

652
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,200
from the streets with gts coordinates

653
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,879
and

654
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,919
and we actually were able to

655
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,279
fill in gradually the whole

656
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,679
map of belgrade which counts more than 1

657
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,200
000

658
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,760
cameras at the moment

659
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,000
so we launched this crowdsourcing

660
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,919
campaign which was really nice

661
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,240
and and this this is kind of success

662
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,400
that

663
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,640
because we have now a strong community

664
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:43,600
supporting us we did

665
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:46,799
a nice campaign a few weeks ago

666
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,279
asking the petition campaign asking

667
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,799
the government to ban biometric mass

668
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:55,039
surveillance

669
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:58,158
and of course finally

670
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,440
we managed to to start a crowdfunding

671
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,640
campaign because as

672
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:06,640
you can see on this internal uh

673
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,960
meme we did one of the main components

674
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,600
in

675
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,640
our starter pack for anti biometric mass

676
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,600
surveillance factories

677
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,960
is resilience we mostly do this pro bono

678
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,039
so we started

679
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,880
this crowdfunding campaign and it's

680
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:22,240
going really well so we are

681
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,000
hoping to ban uh biometrics in belgrade

682
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,240
and remove all the cameras

683
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,840
so thank you very much i will leave it

684
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,840
now to asterisk

685
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:40,159
thank you philip ellis

686
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,720
if you would like to turn on your camera

687
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,520
and

688
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,080
hello yes thank you i'm sorry i had a

689
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,320
small

690
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,158
issue with my camera before also i still

691
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,000
hope that now you can see me well

692
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,760
uh thank you felip thank you andrea

693
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,840
greetings from athens greece

694
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,720
uh in the next few minutes i will

695
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,120
present to you

696
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,840
my slides about the the actions you have

697
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,080
taken

698
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,320
in greece i will speak about the central

699
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,240
database of biometric info

700
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,720
about the use of drones at cameras by

701
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,679
hellenic police during demonstrations

702
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,400
and about an important contract of smart

703
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,480
gases

704
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,720
that will enable the hellenic police to

705
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,600
use facial recognition technology during

706
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,200
stops

707
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:24,480
and controls in our streets so

708
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,240
without further undo to begin with

709
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,480
the hellenic police and the private

710
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,200
vendor called intracon telecom

711
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,320
signed last year a 4 million euro

712
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,400
contract

713
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,439
the company will develop and deliver the

714
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,240
hellenic police

715
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,960
smart devices with integrated software

716
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,080
enable

717
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,400
facing facial recognition and automated

718
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,520
fingerprint identification technologies

719
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,120
among other functionalities the devices

720
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,080
will be very small in the size of the

721
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,760
smartphone

722
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,120
and police officers would be able to

723
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,200
carry them with

724
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,199
to carry these devices with them and use

725
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,279
them during massive police stops

726
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,120
in order to take a close-up photograph

727
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,480
of an individual

728
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,158
as well as to collect their fingerprints

729
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,880
then the fingerprints and photographs

730
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,200
collected will be immediately compared

731
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,159
with

732
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,480
data already stored in eu databases for

733
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,960
identification purposes

734
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,960
so we decided to take some related

735
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,320
actions and to file some extra

736
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,799
information requests

737
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,799
to the hellenic police the replies we

738
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,399
got were very unsatisfying

739
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,799
so we decided to proceed with a

740
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:31,918
complaint before the hellenic data

741
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:34,080
protection authority in march 2020

742
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,080
it is important to remember that no

743
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,158
related legal bases exist

744
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,918
for the use of such technologies in

745
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,000
greece

746
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,679
as well as no data protection impact

747
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,720
assessments were conducted by the

748
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,799
hellenic police

749
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,480
prior to the signature of this smart

750
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:52,559
policing contract of 4 million euros

751
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,080
we were very satisfied to see that the

752
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,960
hellenic data protection authority

753
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,039
follow up

754
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,960
and in august 2020 they started an

755
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,399
official investigation against this

756
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,360
contract

757
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:05,120
now moving on to uh the next action i

758
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,959
will briefly speak to you about a

759
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,279
central biometric database of the

760
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,919
hellenic police

761
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,360
our police collects all fingerprints of

762
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,159
greek passport holders

763
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,240
in this central database it is again

764
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,720
important to underline that based on the

765
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,520
eu laws on passports as well as

766
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,960
the set case law of the european court

767
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,918
of the court of justice of the european

768
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,320
union

769
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,320
fingerprints shall be stored in the past

770
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,918
from themselves in the very documents we

771
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,439
carry in our

772
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,000
bags and in our pockets so the eu law

773
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,720
neither

774
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,039
prohibits nor allows for national

775
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,840
central databases of biometric

776
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,120
info to exist if member states want to

777
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,439
proceed with the creation of such

778
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,399
databases they have to create their own

779
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,720
laws

780
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:53,120
but also we need to remember that based

781
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,440
on european data protection laws

782
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,879
processing of biometric information such

783
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,399
as fingerprints

784
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,320
is allowed where it is strictly

785
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,120
necessary subject to appropriate

786
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,279
safeguards

787
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:07,840
and authorized by a national law

788
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:10,000
so we had to take action again and in

789
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,000
june 2020 we decided to file two

790
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,679
strategic complaints before the hellenic

791
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,039
data protection authorities

792
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,440
using data subjects um two months later

793
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,760
the

794
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,840
taxation authority replied to our

795
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,039
complaint and they started again an

796
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:30,799
official investigation

797
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:33,200
now in addition to these two uh

798
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,000
actions i would like to briefly speak to

799
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,559
you

800
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,840
about the use of drones and other type

801
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,399
of civilian mechanisms by the hellenic

802
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,760
police

803
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:46,000
back in april 2020

804
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,440
we filed one friend of information

805
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,480
access request

806
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,080
before the hellenic ministry of citizens

807
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,520
protection

808
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,720
because the hellenic police used drones

809
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,279
in order to monitor

810
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,159
people's movement uh during the coving

811
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:05,039
19 lockdown measures last easter

812
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,200
also a few days ago we filed other two

813
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,360
freedom of information access requests

814
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,360
before the chief of the hellenic police

815
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,158
regarding the use of drones and cameras

816
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,959
on sticks

817
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,240
in public demonstrations it is important

818
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,039
to mention that back in

819
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,360
april 2020 the hellenic police didn't

820
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,000
have

821
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,678
a legal basis to use drones or other

822
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,760
types of cameras and

823
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,559
surveillance in order to monitor

824
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,879
individual movements

825
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,960
the adoption of a related presidential

826
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,200
degree of the legal base

827
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,399
happened a few months ago in september

828
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,880
2020

829
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,399
so with our first friend of information

830
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,320
access request

831
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,719
to the hellenic ministry of citizen

832
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,240
protection we demanded to know what was

833
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,559
the legal basis

834
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,720
for using these drones in our city

835
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,440
centers baking back in april

836
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,440
while with our second round of friend of

837
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,640
information access requests

838
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,320
we ask the hellenic police uh to give us

839
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,360
access to the related data protection

840
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,360
impact assessment

841
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,799
that sees obli that it is obliged to

842
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,279
carry as well as

843
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,559
to the administrative decisions that the

844
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,519
hellenic police

845
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:14,000
is obliged again to publish based on the

846
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:17,200
applicable laws

847
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,240
and i will now give the floor back

europe

862
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,440
well we're continuing to reveal abusive

863
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,240
uses and to contest

864
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,880
the implementation of biometric mass

865
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,000
surveillance across our public spaces

866
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:15,120
in europe because we're just not seeing

867
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,880
enough action from regulators or data

868
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,518
protection authorities

869
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,080
instead we're seeing law enforcement

870
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,399
governments and private companies

871
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,600
really taking advantage of the

872
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,639
democratic and

873
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,678
legal vacuum that we're in right now

874
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,880
so in 2021 we plan to do

875
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,200
even more to engage people across europe

876
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,200
to help us challenge those in power and

877
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,399
to seek answers about what's really

878
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,279
going on

879
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,959
this is going to include everything from

880
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,559
formal challenges

881
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,240
and requests to information from

882
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,840
authorities like with freedom of

883
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,480
information requests

884
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:56,320
uh also through to public workshops and

885
00:32:52,480 --> 00:33:00,000
even partnerships with artists our

886
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,480
big ticket item for 2021 is going to be

887
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,360
a european citizens initiative calling

888
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,600
to ban

889
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,039
biometric mass surveillance practices in

890
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,279
the eu

891
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,640
this initiative which is also known as

892
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,840
an eci

893
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,519
is a form of legally recognized petition

894
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,320
which will call on the european

895
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:21,840
commission to take concrete legislative

896
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,799
action we have very clearly told them

897
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,320
that right now

898
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,760
the lack of specific eu laws to limit

899
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,399
uses of biometrics

900
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,360
and the problems of enforcing the

901
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,840
existing

902
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,399
general principles have meant that they

903
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,799
are in violation of their obligations

904
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,000
under the eu charter of fundamental

905
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,799
rights and

906
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,399
that causes so many harms in the ways

907
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:47,519
that my colleagues have just

908
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:50,158
explained in just three of the countries

909
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,840
whereas this is happening systematically

910
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,720
across

911
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:57,840
europe and so soon we are going to need

912
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:01,039
over 1 million european nationals to

913
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,158
sign our eci to say that they agree with

914
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,720
our call to ban

915
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,120
biometric mass surveillance practices so

916
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,240
we really hope that we can count on you

917
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,078
for this uh the eci is also going to

918
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,479
give us a platform

919
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,679
to extend the coalition that we've been

920
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,719
building

921
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,240
bridging across issues of labor rights

922
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,040
media freedoms

923
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:25,040
social and racial justice women's rights

924
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,480
lgbtq eye rights

925
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,040
environment and more because

926
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,960
after all biometric mass surveillance is

927
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,480
an issue that can cause

928
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,879
very serious harm to certain groups

929
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,839
but of course it can also have a

930
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:43,279
chilling effect

931
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,679
on absolutely everyone because it really

932
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,639
goes against that fundamental right that

933
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,480
we all have

934
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,480
to respect for our private life

935
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,720
andrea i'd like to uh invite you to let

936
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,800
everyone know how

937
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,359
they can join us and be a part of the

938
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,599
reclaim your face movement

939
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:10,000
thank you anna so biometric data

940
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,520
includes data about our body and

941
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,320
behavior and that means

942
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,839
everything from fingerprint palm print

943
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,400
palm

944
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:21,759
veins face recognition of course dna

945
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:25,119
hand geometry iris recognition

946
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,920
retina recognition typing rhythm walking

947
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,119
manner

948
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:32,480
voice and much more companies

949
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,640
and governments in europe are

950
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,280
innovating and trying to find new ways

951
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,560
to capture your identity

952
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:43,280
um yet under eu

953
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,279
data protection law this data is

954
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,680
especially sensitive

955
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,320
they're linked to our identities and can

956
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,560
be used

957
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,560
to infer protected and intimate

958
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,359
information about who we are

959
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,480
our health and more if you think this is

960
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,279
problematic

961
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,160
and if you're worried about all the

962
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,440
information

963
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:07,520
my colleagues have mentioned so far well

964
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:10,480
get involved over 11 000 people

965
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,200
have already wrote to their governments

966
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,240
you can go on the reclaimyourface.eu

967
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,160
website

968
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,000
and sign a petition to address your

969
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,640
government

970
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,480
from february though we're mobilizing to

971
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:26,078
address the eu

972
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:30,560
so two things what can you do

973
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:32,400
now and what can you do in february 2021

974
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,160
as you've just heard we're focusing on

975
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,280
gathering evidence

976
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,480
and um gathering support

977
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,720
so right now for starters you can write

978
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,839
an email to your mayor or to a city

979
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,640
councilor

980
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,279
in your own city ask them to promise

981
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,359
that will

982
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,520
they will not deploy biometric mass

983
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,640
surveillance in your city's public

984
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,280
spaces

985
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,440
do they reply they're positive about it

986
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,240
get in touch with us and let us know

987
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,520
we'll celebrate together in february

988
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,520
2021

989
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,440
we will launch the european citizen

990
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,560
initiative that my colleague ella

991
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,560
mentioned

992
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,759
in order for this to be really powerful

993
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,400
we need to reach

994
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,640
1 million signatures then the european

995
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,599
commission will be obliged to respond to

996
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,400
us

997
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,160
this means we'll need a lot of help do

998
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,160
you want to get involved in gathering

999
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,920
these signatures

1000
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:28,240
again get in touch finally

1001
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,160
what if you're an organization what if

1002
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,240
you know an organization

1003
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,598
that might be interested in joining our

1004
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,759
coalition

1005
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,720
we're looking in particular like ella

1006
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,920
mentioned

1007
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:43,200
for organizations that cover a broad

1008
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,200
range of areas from media freedom

1009
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,640
freedom of assembly

1010
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:52,720

together a

1014
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,160
civil society movement that will make

1025
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,640
directions

in europe right now i was really

1032
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,440
interested at what made you start the

1033
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,320
campaign or what was the the point where

1034
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,200
you thought

1035
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,800
now now this has to change we have to do

1036
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,598
this campaign and bring organizations

1037
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,160
together

1038
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,160
and stop this

1039
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,640
question yeah so thanks rick and uh hi

1040
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,520
everyone

1041
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,640
and on the uh point about experimenting

1042
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,040
with the q a

1043
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,279
we are very happy and comfortable

1044
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,839
experimenting with q and a's um

1045
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,520
we are not happy with experimenting with

1046
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,160
people's faces and bodies

1047
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,200
and public spaces so that's kind of

1048
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,960
what's driven us

1049
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:23,759
to to launch this this campaign um

1050
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,240
from a policy and legal point of view

1051
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,119
we've been following developments across

1052
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,359
europe

1053
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,240
uh for many many years across the edry

1054
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:33,279
network

1055
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,799
and we were noticing a trend in

1056
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,119
the number of really harmful uses

1057
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,000
just going up and up we were seeing

1058
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,400
every

1059
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,160
or pretty much every police force in

1060
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,280
europe starting to trial

1061
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:50,000
these technologies in a really uh

1062
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,040
sketchy way and we were seeing private

1063
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,079
companies

1064
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,880
rolling them out in supermarkets concert

1065
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,920
stadiums

1066
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,560
football stadiums without any public

1067
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,119
debate

1068
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,880
on what this means without properly

1069
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,319
considering the risk

1070
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,560
without knowing what it means for eu law

1071
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:11,520
and then when there were the rumors that

1072
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,680
the european commission was considering

1073
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,759
some sort of ban on you know five year

1074
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,200
three to five year moratorium on on some

1075
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,680
of these technologies

1076
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,319
in public spaces that have gave us a lot

1077
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,520
of hope

1078
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:26,079
as civil society and as activists and

1079
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,800
it never materialized and we realized

1080
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,640
that

1081
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,400
civil society aren't really being

1082
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,078
listened to and

1083
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,599
the public aren't really being listened

1084
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,800
to when it comes to these

1085
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,960
biometric technologies but as i've

1086
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,200
noticed when i've spoken on panels

1087
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,839
alongside ceos from

1088
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,399
surveillance tech companies they are the

1089
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,279
ones

1090
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,960
that are being listened to by the eu

1091
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,079
they're the ones that are getting

1092
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,800
millions of euros to essentially

1093
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,880
experiment with with our faces and

1094
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,440
bodies with our public spaces

1095
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,560
uh so we decided enough is enough and we

1096
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,000
need to do

1097
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:07,520
something about this um and we needed to

1098
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,760
make sure that our our european values

1099
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,920
our democratic principles are actually

1100
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,880
adhered to you it's really really

1101
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,160
important to us that this is something

1102
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,480
that is considered

1103
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,359
um and not something that's just done

1104
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,680
and

1105
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,799
a few years down the line we hear well

1106
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,960
it's everywhere it's

1107
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,319
it's too late um because it's not too

1108
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:30,400
late this is really

1109
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:33,759
the time for us to take decisive action

1110
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,040
but yeah andrea am i am i missing no i

1111
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,160
think that was a great

1112
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:42,240
overview um and

1113
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:46,000
if i if i may um chip in some thoughts

1114
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:49,040
we started working on this already

1115
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,640
i think more than a year ago right so

1116
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,000
when the corona crisis

1117
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:56,799
and all the measures um to

1118
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,359
stop the spread of it were not even in

1119
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,040
our

1120
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,598
worst dreams um but i feel like in the

1121
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,680
past

1122
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:08,960
months the general public has

1123
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:12,000
grown more and more aware of where

1124
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,280
can surveillance measures

1125
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,400
lead to and how do they look like and

1126
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:22,960
see them above their heads when they go

1127
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:26,000
out in their cities and i feel like

1128
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:29,440
this this awareness um

1129
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,920
is also a very very kind of

1130
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,640
big push for this campaign to move

1131
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,960
forward

1132
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,359
and like ella mentioned when you see

1133
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,680
that people are outraged about this

1134
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,560
and when you know that the eu is making

1135
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,520
new laws

1136
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,799
on the topic there is no way we can stay

1137
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,079
quiet

1138
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:51,359
so i feel like um yeah i'm

1139
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,760
sure and i i hope not but

1140
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,799
i have a presupposition but more and

1141
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,400
more reasons

1142
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,079
we carry this fight for world war ii

1143
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,800
appear

1144
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,800
so we better start mobilizing

1145
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,040
ella you mentioned that in many many um

1146
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,200
cases there's no real debate and people

1147
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,800
just start implementing systems and are

1148
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,720
listening to the

1149
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,160
company bosses of big companies instead

1150
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,640
of the general public

1151
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,480
what do you think is the reason for that

1152
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,839
so why are we missing out on these

1153
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,599
really important debates

1154
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:29,599
what what do we need to do to have these

1155
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,599
debates before systems are introduced

1156
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,400
there are so many reasons really why why

1157
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,240
it's happened this way

1158
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,520
um a lot of the pushback shall we say

1159
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,839
that we hear from

1160
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,440
the european commission for example are

1161
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:44,560
things that just aren't true so there's

1162
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,440
a lot of

1163
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,640
myths out there and people say oh well

1164
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,520
you can unlock your

1165
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,160
phone with your fingerprint um so it's

1166
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,160
too late

1167
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,759
and actually that's that's really not

1168
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,399
the same thing as

1169
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,359
suddenly every time you leave your house

1170
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,720
to go

1171
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:05,598
to a protest uh to walk in a park to

1172
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,520
to do nothing as is your right um

1173
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:10,720
suddenly you're being tracked

1174
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:14,400
and not only trapped but that's etched

1175
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:16,799
into your identity um in a really

1176
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,000
immutable way that's going to follow you

1177
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,800
around and connect you to lots of people

1178
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,839
is absolutely not the same thing as

1179
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,560
unlocking

1180
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,520
a phone so we hear these kind of

1181
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,720
arguments that

1182
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,359
that aren't really uh aren't really true

1183
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,240
um and we face the kind of security

1184
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,440
argument

1185
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,839
um a lot and we have uh

1186
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,960
governments in particular using that to

1187
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:44,160
justify doing

1188
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,800
uh unlawful activities and actually uh

1189
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,759
if you

1190
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,480
look at the eu law that we have there

1191
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,640
are of course

1192
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,680
provisions that allow governments and

1193
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,480
police forces

1194
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,359
to protect their citizens um that's a

1195
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,560
legitimate

1196
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:00,400
policy goal to keep people safe um

1197
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,400
it's just that there are controls on the

1198
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,079
way that they're allowed to do this

1199
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,200
so that we can have those checks and

1200
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:10,480
balances that also protect us from

1201
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,598
abuses of power um from arbitrary

1202
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,720
surveillance

1203
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:17,839
um so actually these excuses about oh we

1204
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:20,319
need to do this and it's justified

1205
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:21,839
i'm not true there's a very clear legal

1206
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,000
threshold and

1207
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,440
what we're seeing is pretty much every

1208
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
single european country

1209
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,280
is is not meeting these legal thresholds

1210
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,240
that are designed

1211
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,000
actually to keep us safe and when we

1212
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,319
think actually about what it

1213
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,280
what it means to feel safe and to feel

1214
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,400
secure

1215
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:43,520
to know that you can express yourself

1216
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,800
uh whether that's your gender identity

1217
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,759
your religious beliefs um whatever it

1218
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,359
might be

1219
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:55,280
you should be free to to be yourself

1220
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:57,680
um and secure knowing that you can vote

1221
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,960
you can attend a community event you can

1222
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,560
participate

1223
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,560
in the things that make it

1224
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,720
worth living the public activities that

1225
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,680
make us feel a part of something

1226
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,919
bigger than ourselves and i've said this

1227
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:15,200
before you you only have to look at

1228
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:17,839
every dystopian science fiction

1229
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,480
film and book ever to know that the

1230
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:22,880
thought of society where there's someone

1231
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,200
breathing down our neck and capturing

1232
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:29,359
every bit of us to put in the database

1233
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:32,240
and turning us into walking barcodes um

1234
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:33,680
it's not a society where everyone feels

1235
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,598
safe and secure it's

1236
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,200
it's actually one where we're treated as

1237
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,839
if we're a criminal suspect

1238
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,799
all the time and we know that once

1239
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:44,000
people

1240
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,359
understand it in those terms and and see

1241
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,760
the fact that this doesn't

1242
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:49,759
contribute to the sort of free and

1243
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,319
vibrant and open society that

1244
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,000
i think the vast majority of us want i

1245
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,880
think then it's a lot easier to

1246
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,920
understand

1247
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:01,520
um the nuance of this debate

1248
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,920
and to not necessarily pay attention to

1249
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,560
a lot of the either political statements

1250
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,079
that we hear

1251
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,200
or often the marketing you hear tech

1252
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,760
companies spout

1253
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,279
all sorts of glossy things and often

1254
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,079
they can't do what they say

1255
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,480
we've found many that are not lawful if

1256
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,960
they do what they claim they can do

1257
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,480
um but that's a lot of of what we hear

1258
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,119
in civil society

1259
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,160
our budgets are not as large as the the

1260
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,640
tech giants

1261
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,078
um which is why it's really important

1262
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,920
that we

1263
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:36,319
find creative ways to raise our voices

1264
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,079
yeah yeah just to add to that i think

1265
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:41,279
biometric data is really

1266
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:44,880
a gold mine

1267
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,720
for government surveillance but also for

1268
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,000
surveillance capitalism so when we're

1269
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,160
talking about this

1270
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,240
we're talking about private companies of

1271
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,078
course on the other side

1272
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,558
but we're also talking about government

1273
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:59,839
so there is here common interest

1274
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:02,480
um that i feel it's not made

1275
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:04,558
clear for obvious reasons to the public

1276
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,760
and i feel like there's also

1277
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:10,319
a misunderstanding when we're

1278
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,839
discussing what is the real public

1279
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:14,000
interest at stake

1280
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,960
because of course governments and

1281
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,079
companies can

1282
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,400
shop can shape the discussion around

1283
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,920
public interest and what does that mean

1284
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,200
when it comes to biometric data and

1285
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,720
biometric mass surveillance

1286
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:29,359
face recognition but is that really

1287
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,480
the public's interest is it really in

1288
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:34,400
public's interest

1289
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,160
to feel like you're a suspect whenever

1290
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,800
you go out of your house

1291
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,520
in a public space is it in your public

1292
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,800
interest

1293
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:46,160
to fear that you know whatever database

1294
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:48,880
that has your face stored on will

1295
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,640
leak tomorrow and you will never be able

1296
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,800
to change your face again

1297
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:56,078
or is this in our public interest i

1298
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:59,040
don't i doubt so so i think

1299
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:01,680
perhaps we can also you know do better

1300
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:04,640
across civil society to

1301
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,720
have a common narrative about what is it

1302
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:10,240
that we want

1303
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,240
this public interest to mean

1304
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,960
explanations to me

1305
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:21,040
it seems like you're implying that

1306
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,640
many of these misunderstandings or that

1307
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,319
people um

1308
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,920
see these technologies in different

1309
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:28,558
lights actually comes

1310
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,319
from not being informed enough and not

1311
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,440
being informed enough how these

1312
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:34,960
technologies work

1313
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,760
and what implications they have and it

1314
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,760
it kind of like

1315
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,839
what i got from your answer is that the

1316
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,680
the difference of a utopia and a

1317
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:44,640
dystopia

1318
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,040
is like the nuances what you think might

1319
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,279
happen

1320
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,079
as soon as these systems are installed

1321
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,640
and

1322
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,079
what do you think what do we need we as

1323
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,640
a movement as a

1324
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,839
um as people as civil societies what do

1325
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,759
we need to do

1326
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,440
to get that knowledge to these people

1327
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,240
who are making these decisions

1328
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:04,480
that they kind of like can come to our

1329
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:07,359
side and see that it's actually a step

1330
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,079
towards a technological dystopia and not

1331
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:13,359
a

1332
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:16,880
safe and nice future for everybody

1333
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:20,000
yeah well if i may i think

1334
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:22,880
i'm thinking translation into ability

1335
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,599
we often talk about uh you know human

1336
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,800
rights but

1337
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:28,000
these are such theoretical non-tangible

1338
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,520
concepts that

1339
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,680
very few of us actually envision

1340
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,440
something when they spell them out and i

1341
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,879
feel like we need to make

1342
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:41,920
these concepts much more clear

1343
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,880
and much more close to the everyday

1344
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,079
reality

1345
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:49,680
of people um i feel like

1346
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:52,720
this is something we can definitely

1347
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,440
work more on and also personally i think

1348
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,799
the role of

1349
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:59,680
art is so important at

1350
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,359
inferring the impact of biometric mass

1351
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,799
surveillance

1352
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:07,200
on our freedoms without mentioning the

1353
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,079
human right that is at stake but rather

1354
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,839
the experience

1355
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:14,880
that europe have if you don't take

1356
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:15,599
an action and finally i think you know

1357
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,359
we spoke

1358
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:20,079
a lot about dystopias and utopias but i

1359
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,558
feel like

1360
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,599
we're um and i feel like we're doing

1361
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,240
that already

1362
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,640
we really need to envision what do we

1363
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,759
want

1364
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,240
this um future to look like in order for

1365

to work towards the positive vision of

1377
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,640
the kind of world that we're trying to

1378

not

1381
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,240
put in a box and not judged and labeled

1382
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,319
and controlled based on

1383
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,000
