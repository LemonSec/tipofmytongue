tin

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,680
a european regulation claimed to

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,680
guarantee net neutrality

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,198
and the right for users to choose their

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,119
own routers

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,480
but is the battle for net neutrality

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,599
over yet

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,320
no it is not in this next talk lucas

10
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,600
lazotta

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,399
who works for the fsfe will explain

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,920
how these new national implementations

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,640
of the regulation

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,480
will put these rights at risk i'm

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,559
looking forward to its overview over

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,959
recent successes for router freedom

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,079
in the eu and what challenges are coming

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,840
in the future

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:57,600

will be about net neutrality in europe

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,520
and the continuation of the struggle

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,759

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,079
we are having right now my name is lucas

and so let's get started today

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,399
uh i want to talk about router freedom

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,360
an activity that we conducted uh when

47
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,040
the

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,320
in the free software foundation europe

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,440
for already uh several

50
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,160
internet this topic has grown more

51
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,400
traction

52
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,359
and become very important in the last

53
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,520
years

54
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,800
and we'll talk about what is router

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,000
freedom what is

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,959
opennet internet and device neutrality

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,920
and of course why router freedom today

58
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,680
is in danger

59
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,958
in in europe and what you can do to help

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,319
so how you can join our

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,440
advocate so how you can join us in our

62
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,799
activity

63
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,920
so everybody in europe every citizen has

64
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,560
his or her rights guaranteed to use

65
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,079
their own equipment to connect to the

66
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,440
internet

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,120
first i would like to

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,160
say that well internet

69
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,120
oh i'm sorry internet access

70
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,680
is a human right so we do everything

71
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,120
today

72
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,680
in the internet and this year has shown

73
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,640
that not only our normal interactions

74
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,120
but our

75
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,480
not our personal interactions but also

76
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,959
our

77
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,799
work interactions everything that we do

78
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,480
are connected the internet so

79
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,040
we must guarantee or empower

80
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,679
users to have access to the internet

81
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,879
through their

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,280
own means through their own equipment so

83
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,480
guaranteeing their the right to use

84
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,480
their own equipment

85
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,319
in order to connect to the internet is a

86
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,599
must and

87
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,159
since 2015 this right is guaranteed by

88
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,920
european

89
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:43,920
regulation so um

90
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,640
through uh the net neutrality regulation

91
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,238
although

92
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,958
the official name is called open

93
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:53,360
internet regulation

94
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:56,720
guarantees end users consumer citizens

95
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,400
for the far freedoms of net neutrality

96
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,280
the freedom of content

97
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,480
freedom of application they want to use

98
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,760
freedom of services

99
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,599
and freedom of devices well we use

100
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,159
different devices to connect to the

101
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,720
internet when we are at home we use

102
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,439
home home routers when we are in the

103
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,478
street we

104
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,599
use our own smartphone for an example

105
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:23,199
and uh although

106
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,639
uh it's quite intuitive that nobody

107
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,280
today tells that the isp owns your own

108
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,759
telephone

109
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,679
and you can use your own telephone your

110
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,040
own smartphone to connect to the to

111
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,759
the internet it's not like that when

112
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,800
it comes to the router the home router

113
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,160
that you use

114
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,880
so in fact we have seen

115
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,720
that uh users are although it is

116
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,719
guaranteed by law

117
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,639
users have a lot of problems to uh

118
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,000
use their own router to connect to the

119
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,800
internet and

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,520
of course if you have your own router if

121
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,880
you have the

122
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,520
the free choice of your own equipment

123
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,759
um not only is compliant with the law

124
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,159
but there is a lot of benefits and here

125
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,520
i would just like to say some of them

126
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,240
if we if we protect router freedom

127
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,919
so the type of equipment that we use to

128
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,199
connect to the internet of course

129
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,719
then we are protecting freedom of choice

130
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,720
we are protecting privacy data

131
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,639
protection of the users

132
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,560
competition in compatibility in the

133
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,840
equipment market and of course

134
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,800
security because users can update their

135
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,560
own software

136
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,000
and to make their equipment more secure

137
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,880
yes but therefore

138
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,880
the the legislation protects that but as

139
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,400
we're gonna see it it's not so

140
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,759
uh straightforward uh to comprehend

141
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,159
but uh net neutrality

142
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,960
uh elders for freedoms is just the

143
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,720
beginning

144
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,280
of a broader debate uh that is going on

145
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,240
right now

146
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,198
in europe net neutrality guarantees that

147
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,039
every user can access any online content

148
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,560
or service using the device of their

149
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,560
choice

150
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,479
the focus of net neutrality debate is

151
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,759
concerned with the various network

152
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,080
management practices that

153
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,280
internet service providers the network

154
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,120
operators

155
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,919
should be allowed to pursue being the

156
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,000
central gatekeepers between consumers

157
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,840
and content providers

158
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,360
there is a difference between however

159
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,520
between open internet and net neutrality

160
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,800
the european net neutrality regulation

161
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,080
from 2015

162
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,039
we're going to talk about that in a

163
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,479
minute and try and uh enshrines user

164
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,400
rights to access and distribute

165
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,880
information and content online

166
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,560
but it applies only to the internet

167
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,960
service providers which are

168
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,759
all only one link in the internet access

169
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,840
chain

170
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,759
the ability to access the internet and

171
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,840
provide content to relies

172
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,880
on a much larger chain in which other

173
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:59,599
stakeholders also play an important role

174
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,039
well open internet is a broader concept

175
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,880
it involves regulation against

176
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,800
discriminatory practices involving

177
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,440
software and hydro which could impact

178
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,039
any

179
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,759
end users reads of choice for an example

180
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,639
operating system neutrality devices

181
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,720
manufacturers

182
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,800
with select and operating system and a

183
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,080
small number of popular apps that cannot

184
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,400
be uninstalled

185
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,359
the same is true for app stores in the

186
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,039
mobile

187
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,360
market search neutrality search engines

188
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,000
like

189
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,280
google or bing may have no neutral

190
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,680
conduct by ranking

191
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,119
search results that relates to its own

192
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,759
or affiliated

193
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,120
services high in the organic and paid

194
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,039
search results

195
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,880
and of course browser web browser

196
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,840
neutrality

197
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,919
can because web browsers can also be a

198
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,919
vehicle that allows vertical integrated

199
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,440
companies in favor their own services at

200
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,120
the expense of consumers

201
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,400
freedom of choice well uh

202
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,240
so we think that uh the the debate of

203
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,560
net neutrality uh

204
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,680
is much broader when we consider

205
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,720
disorder kind

206
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,360
of neutrality in this

207
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,000
in these other elements in the chain and

208
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,759
in this

209
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,120
in this picture we can see that the

210
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,160
router uh

211
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,199
stands in the end of

212
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,319
the the the network between the end

213
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,520
users domain

214
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,520
and the public uh

215
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:29,119
network isp domain

216
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,719
and that's exactly the point

217
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,039
where router freedom stays in danger

218
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,080
and why router freedom a concept a very

219
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,360
clear concept

220
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,440
uh in law is being danger right now

221
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,560
well we're going to see that there are

222
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,120
vague rules

223
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,000
on the european level uh national

224
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,560
authorities

225
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,320
are responsible for monitoring the

226
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,760
activities of the internet services

227
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,120
providers they are doing the bad

228
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,040
monetary

229
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,640
and the network uh operators they are

230
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,640
imposing barriers on

231
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:05,040
users so let's see uh the first one

232
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,720
so i said the net neutrality regulation

233
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,000
from 2015

234
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,640
the uh provides users the the

235
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,560
the right of to choice to choose and to

236
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,240
use the routers and equipment they want

237
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,439
to connect to the internet

238
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,200
um but in 2020 uh there is

239
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,920
a new set of rules technical rules

240
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,160
regarding the network termination point

241
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,800
a definition

242
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,160
that the terms if the router and the

243
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,279
modem should pertain

244
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,839
should pertain to the user or to

245
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,320
internet service providers and barrack

246
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,160
has

247
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,959
uh put some uh criteria to determine

248
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,920
if the router should uh who should have

249
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,319
the property of

250
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:53,680
the router the the user or the isp

251
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,080
the most controversial topic in that

252
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,560
is that they say if there is a

253
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,000
technological necessity

254
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,119
if the isp can determine a technological

255
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,240
necessity

256
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,720
the router can can go

257
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,880
directly to the infrastructure of the

258
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,320
isp

259
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,040
and right now the

260
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,480
eu member states they will implement

261
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,519
these rules the network

262
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,959
the natural regulation the uh

263
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,839
doesn't need to to be implemented

264
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:29,839
because of regulation but the guidelines

265
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:33,440
on ntp will have to be implemented uh

266
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,720
on eu member states and here lies the

267
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,079
problems because it

268
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,240
will be easier for isp to prove

269
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,120
technological necessity and they can

270
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,440
keep uh our routers in their own

271
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,360
infrastructure

272
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:50,320
so uh besides that

273
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,360
this national regulatory aid authorities

274
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,160
who

275
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,040
okay so uh right now the national

276
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,319
regulatory

277
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,000
uh authorities they are responsible for

278
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,959
monitoring the activity of

279
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,279
isp they are doing very bad and they are

280
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,839
not

281
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,839
imposing any type of

282
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,560
fines or penalties

283
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,359
on those who do not comply with the

284
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,040
regulation

285
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,510
allowing users to use their own routers

286
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,079
and of course uh

287
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:25,279
[Music]

288
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,239
isp they are imposing different kind of

289
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,360
barriers

290
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,079
uh in uh for consumers

291
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,760
to use their own routers and we at the

292
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,000
fsfe we divided

293
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,439
these barriers in two types the software

294
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,600
barriers and the hard

295
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,519
barriers of course the hard ones are

296
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,440
much serious because for an example

297
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,360
cause

298
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,800
customers are forbidden to use another

299
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,360
router by contract

300
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,880
isp do not provide users they login data

301
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,720
to the public network

302
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,560
they use known standard plugs or

303
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,160
proprietary protocols

304
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,920
and of course they don't they don't

305
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,120
offer technical support

306
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,959
uh for internet access but there are

307
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,800
other types of barriers software

308
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,160
barriers for example when they don't

309
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,319
inform

310
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,399
the users that they have the right to

311
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,720
use their own routers or

312
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,920
they manipulate users through customer

313
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,040
support in favor

314
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,599
of their own routers and of course there

315
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,079
are other

316
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,959
types of barriers that isp are very

317
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,839
creative

318
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,439
in order to impose their own equipment

319
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,639
on users

320
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,839
so uh what you can do to help

321
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,800
um as we said uh there

322
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,600
there is very clear rules defending our

323
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,519
rights but

324
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,880
right now we are suffering a lot of

325
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,920
people are suffering

326
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,600
with their network operators the

327
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,360
internet service provides because they

328
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,560
don't they cannot use

329
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,000
um their routers and we are we want to

330
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,880
change this scenario

331
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,880
we want to

332
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,720
demonstrate that in fact our rights

333
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,720
should be

334
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,720
respected and we can do that because

335
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,160
there are very clear rules

336
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:09,680
so what you can do to help three

337
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,519
three steps uh contact your isp ask if

338
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,439
you can use your router

339
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,959
and send me an email tell me the results

340
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,680
lucas.lasota

341
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:21,920
fsf.org and

342
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,439
let me know uh what are the kind of

343
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,959
problems you are having

344
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,920
and we are working there to

345
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,638
raise awareness in europe around router

346
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,479
freedom

347
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:37,760
and fighting for our rights

348
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:41,279
so i i think uh we are done

349
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:44,000
my presentations uh um

350
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,320
is quite short and i would just i would

351
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,839
be

352
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,320
very happy to hear if there is some

353
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,279
questions

354
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,519
thank you very much thanks and what

355
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,959
people can do i really like the strong

356
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,639
call for action ask your isp so far

357
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,839
there have been no questions from the

358
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,680
internet

359
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,360
but i thought that maybe so

360
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,760
when when i was thinking about what you

361
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,240
just told us i was really interested

362
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,160
if you could tell us so imagine a legal

363
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,639
situation where the route of freedom in

364
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,199
the u

365
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,000
is absolutely guaranteed what's

366
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,639
beautiful

367
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,920
nice things would happen for the user so

368
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,160
what what is the vision

369
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,839
we're working towards here what are the

370
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,519
the really good things

371
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:30,560
that would happen for users if we if we

372
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,199
won this fight yes uh

373
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,599
absolutely uh again just i wanted to

374
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,680
show

375
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,680
that the benefits for that because

376
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:44,240
first freedom of choice users will be

377
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,560
completely free to choose the equipment

378
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,399
they want

379
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:53,040
today an isp for an isp is very

380
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,680
easy to impose their own router and if

381
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,040
we are

382
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,880
obliged to use their router we have

383
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,120
problems with security because

384
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,959
we don't know uh which kind of software

385
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,760
if it's preparatory structure running

386
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,800
in their equipment um we don't know if

387
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,880
this software uh

388
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,399
has some bugs and therefore we don't

389
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,360
know which kind of software is running

390
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,360
on the equipment

391
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,720
so our privacy and that protection is

392
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,480
all compromised

393
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,720
and of course when we have the

394
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,760
possibility to choose our own equipment

395
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,160
it's it's uh we can uh

396
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,120
it's very nice for the market because we

397
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,719
can then

398
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,639
provide free competition and

399
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,480
compatibility so we are

400
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,199
fighting this kind of fight for router

401
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,800
freedom so

402
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:40,240
users can enjoy this kind of benefits

403
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,359
okay thank you there just

404
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,000
a question came in

405
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,639
um so it's and the question is asking

406
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,680
about the possible examples of these

407
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,839
technological measures

408
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,439
i think the rest is missing do you

409
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,240
already understand what the question

410
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,320
means

411
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,519
so i think there's technical measures

412
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,639
the isps

413
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,399
are implementing or the requirements um

414
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,839
right and i think the question is asking

415
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,880
for example for that

416
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:12,639
do you have any maybe

417
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:16,160
oh yes for an example uh

418
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,639
well a very very true example because

419
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,480
happened

420
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,920
to to me and to other staffers in the

421
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,240
fsfe the

422
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,479
isp they don't want to provide use the

423
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,279
loading data to the public network so we

424
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,120
tell them

425
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,959
look i have my router here and i need

426
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,839
the looking data to access

427
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,599
your network so we i can have access to

428
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,680
the internet here at my home

429
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,440
and they say i'm sorry uh the the

430
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,800
looking data is provided

431
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,000
only inside the our own equipment so we

432
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,880
cannot provide you that

433
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,839
you must use our own equipment so this

434
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,959
is one of

435
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,279
one of types of barriers one type of

436
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,079
technical measures that isb imposed on

437
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,959
users

438
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,319
and uh and we talked like here but it's

439
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,680
happening all

440
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,680
