welcome

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,279
to the zeitgeist stage of the rc3

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,000
this has been a very unexpected year

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,960
the new airport in berlin opened and a

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,719
global pandemic

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,000
killed 1.7 million people as this year

8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,920
is very different

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,520
this congress also is very different for

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,239
us

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,640
this year the open infrastructure orbit

12
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,038
and the about freedom assembly cluster

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,280
joint forces to organize this stage here

14
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,520
in berlin together

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,280
before we tell you other information

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,800
about that

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,840
right at the beginning there's a

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,320
possibility for you to be in the virtual

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,800
audience

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,239
under this link audience.rc3.orio.social

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,560
you can join the audience and be

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,600
displayed with beamers installed

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,520
so that we and other speakers later

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,080
can see you while having talks

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,759
so now more to us the assembly class of

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,000
organizing this

27
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,040
the about freedom cluster is a cluster

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,520
of assemblies

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,080
that focus around technology human

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,640
rights

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,720
and climate justice for example this is

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,159
what our cluster looked like at the last

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,360
camp

34
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,640

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,079
remember the the harbor of the open

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,360
infrastructure orbit

38
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:49,279
last year and the year before in leipzig

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,920
a lot of ships have been there and now

40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,479
some of the members that took part in

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,240
the

42
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,079
open infrastructure orbiting leipzig are

43
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,520
already also here in

44
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,320
berlin yeah this is what their stage

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,840
looked like

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,000
last year and now we come

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,960
to a short introduction of the members

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,959
of these

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,720
organizations that participated this

50
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,120
year in building the stage

51
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,319
building this cluster and and he's going

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,360
to do that

53
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,399
yep the first one is completely new to

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,640
uh to the open infrastructure orbit and

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,200
about freedom it's the cccb

56
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,319
it's the berlin branch of the chaos

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,119
computer club

58
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,679
the largest hacker association in europe

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,840
and

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,720
maybe in the world i i'm not sure about

61
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,360
that

62
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,720
and some members helped us building this

63
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,080
wonderful room and

64
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:44,080
the stage and organizing all

65
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,080
that you can see us in our life

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,800
there's also some remote help from c3

67
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,599
space they helped us in designing

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,599
things and

69
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,080
can't be here because they are not

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,480
located in berlin or somewhere nearby

71
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,959
and

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,720
so they maybe have another assembly in

73
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,840
the rc3 world maybe

74
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,840
you can discover them there

75
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,159
and next one is yes

76
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,680
this one's called concept neue economy

77
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,959
or in english something like

78
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,599
concept space for new economics

79
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,720
they focus on alternative economic

80
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,200
concepts

81
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,200
and they try to create alliances

82
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,238
collaborate with social movements

83
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:35,518
and do educational work

84
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,239
there's open source gardens open source

85
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,720
seeds

86
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,560
are seeds that everybody can plant and

87
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,200
the open source gardens project is a

88
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,159
community of open source enthusiasts

89
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,839
who plant open source seeds in their

90
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,920
gardens and in community gardens

91
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,879
yeah and another member is the torah

92
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,238
network the

93
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:59,200
anonymity network you maybe all know

94
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,640
where you can surf the internet in an

95
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,040
anonymous way

96
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,279
they can't be here too but they have a

97
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,720
talk tomorrow or the day after tomorrow

98
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,280

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,920
introduction of

101
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,399
all the other organizations that are

102
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,199
part of the open infrastructure orbit

103
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:29,840
end

104
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:29,840
about freedom cluster in this year

105
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,800
hello to all of you we are digital

106
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,479
freiheit

107
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,919
we are a bunch of young people who are

108
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,560
committed to privacy and informational

109
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,880
self-determination

110
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,120
we want to show that data protection is

111
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,520
very important and necessary

112
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,000
for a healthy democracy in mass

113
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,000
civilians we see a problem that concerns

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,240
all of us and not only the people with a

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,720
computer science degree

116
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,720
we started in 2017 as a student

117
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,560
organization at university

118
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,000
now we are a registered non-profit

119
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,080
organization

120
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,240
we started with interventions for

121
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,880
example as facial recognition tests

122
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,919
started at the train station's utcoids

123
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,000
we built camera hats and for the

124
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,039
behavioral tests at zukults

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,680
we post at x-ray skeletons

126
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,800
and as our minister of interior wanted

127
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,919
to expand

128
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,639
governmental and police hacking we post

129
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,799
in underpants in front of the ministry

130
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,720
but we also think it is important to

131
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,280
bring organizations together

132
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,240
and to organize broad protests against

133
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,318
current surveillance extension plans

134
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,759
for example when there was a draft law

135
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,960
they wanted to introduce facial

136
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,759
recognition systems

137
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,000
at airports and train stations we

138
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,600
initiated the alliance gazette canon

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,960
minus stopping point e

140
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,560
which means something like

141
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,719
bandfashionrecognition.te

142
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,400
in that alliance we demand with other

143
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,240
organizations that

144
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,560
facial recognition technology has to be

145
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,240
banned in public places in germany

146
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,560
we always work on content production

147
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,240
themes like campaigns and texts

148
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,280
but also on things you can simply

149
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,880
participate in

150
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,758
like printing t-shirts organizing art or

151
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,759
photo actions

152
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,280
designing leaflets or stickers it's

153
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,000
actually

154
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,359
quite easy to come by to just drop by in

we will talk about net politics but also

157
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,440
plan new actions and there's always

158
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,960
something to do for somebody who's just

159
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,840
starting out and is not

160
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,638
super familiar with all the vocabulary

161

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,440
users to control technology

176
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,960
our work is based on three pillars

177
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,400
public awareness

178
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,560
policy work and legal work free software

179
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,000
also known as open source software is

180
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,160
used in a lot of places

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,919
but people often don't know about it

182
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,080
that's why we spread the word

183
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,120
that software freedom means that you can

184
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,800
use

185
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,319
study share and improve it

186
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,800
we run campaigns give talks and organize

187
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,560
information booths all around europe we

188
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,599
interact with people from diverse

189
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,280
backgrounds

190
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,800
often with people who have never heard

191
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,559
about free software before

192
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,240
software freedom is crucial for

193
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,840
functional democracy and the

194
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,000
distribution of powers

195
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,359
that's why we help politicians and

196
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,679
public administrations

197
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,240
to understand why free software is

198
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,478
important for democratic society

199
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,560
we give feedback to public consultations

200
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,320
and answer requests by politicians and

201
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,079
public servants

202
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,560
with our public money public code

203
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,720
framework we provide materials which are

204
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,880
successfully used by individuals

205
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,720
and organizations to explain free

206
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,880
software to politicians

207
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,959
free software licenses build a solid

208
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,839
basis for collaborative software

209
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,479
development

210
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,000
and ensure that developers work stays

211
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,920
free in future

212
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,760
legal aspects of free software can

213
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,199
sometimes seem complex

214
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,080
that's why we provide easy

215
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,399
understandable ethic use and guidelines

216
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,760
we also facilitate a legal network where

217
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,839
we bring people together

218
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,480
to share and exchange knowledge about

219
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,120
free software legal and licensing issues

220
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,000
we have come a long way since 2001 and

221
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,360
build an amazing

222
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,519
community as a charity we depend on your

223
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,279
support to foster software freedom in

224
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,720
the next 20 years

225

226
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,000

227
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,760
my first teacher once wrote down an

228
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,720
african saying for me

229
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,080
many small people in many small places

230
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,800

231
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,360
that will change the face of the world

232

make end to end encryption easy and

252
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,479
automatic for everyone everywhere was

253
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,959
the goal when we created pep

254
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,800
we wanted to do for privacy and security

255
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,920
what skype had done for voice

256

that works for any transport so it works

260
00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:00,000

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,160
end-to-end encryption in order to defend

265

digital security

266
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,760

we've been investigating and researching

307
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,160
uses of biometric technologies such as

308

facial recognition

309
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,519
that are already in place in europe

right now

to reveal the fact that these

316
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,399
deployments have happened

317

european commission has been

experimenting with so-called lie

against young people in schools and they

proportionate or necessary

under eu human rights laws and part of

337
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,160
our work to do this has been in joining

together across civil society across

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,240
we're calling on european companies and

european leaders

345
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,000
to be more transparent about why and how

346
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,920
they're deploying biometric technologies

347

370

sustainable democratic and free public

372
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,240
domain

373
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,079
in our increasingly digitized world we

374
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,199
inform and counsel individuals and

375
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,279
institutions

376
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,959
we carry out risk benefit analysis of

377
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,600
emerging technologies

378
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,920
also related to human rights issues we

379
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,040
offer services like tour exit nodes

380
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,399
software projects

381
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,560
and workshops to digital privacy

382
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,480
we want to be a critical voice to public

383
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,479
policy and a partner for informed

384
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,519
decision makers in the legislative

385
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,279
process

386
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,000
we also bring matters to court to

387
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,000
strengthen civil society when necessary

388
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,839
we're engaged in sustaining the

389
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,440
principles of net neutrality

390
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,600
strengthening data protection and

391
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,519
security and are working on modernizing

392
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,399
swiss copyright law

393
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,959
we support open data freedom of opinion

394
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,120
and freedom of expression

395
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,160
so consequently we counter excessive

396
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,639
state surveillance

397
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,800
censorship and network borrowing we're

398
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,639
organized in different working groups

2020 is different welcome to the remote

408
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,920
assembly hall and the about freedom

409
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,160
space

410
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,439
i'm sarah and that's my colleague leah

411
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,360
and we're both lawyers

412
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:40,959
at gsf gazette chef

413
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,759
let's get right to it leah what is gsf

414
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,119
and what do we do gff is a berlin-based

415
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,759
human rights organization

416
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,160
and we focus on strategic litigation

417
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,920
which makes us a little bit special

418
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,920
strategic litigation means that we use

419
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,719
legal means generally lawsuits and

420
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,040
litigation

421
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,959
to strengthen human rights and to

422
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,240
ultimately push for social and political

423
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,119
change

424
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,799
can you give us an example i can imagine

425
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,640
many people here know us from our work

426
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,400
on digital rights so maybe you could

427
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,480
give an example of a case you've worked

428
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,160
on this year beyond that field

429
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,000
a subject that i've worked on a lot this

430
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,880
year is the discrimination of queer

431
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,640
families

432
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,240
so in the traditional example if a woman

433
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,240
gives birth to a child

434
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,400
she's recognized as the first parent and

435
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,919
then if she's married to a man this man

436
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,919
is automatically recognized as the

437
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,720
second parent and this is regardless of

438
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,640
whether or not

439
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,640
he's actually the biological parent so

440
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,960
if the couple used the sperm donor

441
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,840
the men the husband is nonetheless

442
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,480
recognized

443
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,199
as the second parent but everything

444
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,840
changes

445
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,039
if that woman is married to a woman a

446
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,918
non-binary person

447
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,600
or a trans man in all those cases the

448
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,200
child only has one parent

449
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,678
and the second parent is not legally

450
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,320
recognized and the only way to change

451
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,400
this

452
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,520
is for the couple to go through an

453
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,120
adoption procedure

454
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,120
and that's a lengthy procedure which

455
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,360
takes time and it means that a

456
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,159
government agency comes to the family

457
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,399
and may ask

458
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,600
questions about their finances their

459
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,679
health or

460
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,639
their relationship to the child that

461
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,679
seems like a

462
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,200
clear gender-based discrimination so as

463
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,080
we're a strategic litigation

464
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,559
organization

465
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,080
let me guess you're taking it to court

466
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,080
yes we've taken it to court

467
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,080
together with two wonderful families and

468
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,320
two very good lawyers

469
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,918
we are bringing this before instance

470
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,439
courts right now and we're hoping to

471
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,400
bring this before the constitutional

472
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,720
court

473
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,799
and if we get a positive decision by the

474
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,640
constitutional court then that'll change

475
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,480
not only the life of the claimants

476
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,240
but the life of many rainbow families

477
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,960
out there that sounds great

478
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,840
so is strategic litigation always about

479
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,760
winning a case or is there more to it i

480
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,280
think there's much more to it than just

481
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,120
winning the individual case because the

482
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,639
underlying issue is much greater and

483
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,399
it's the issue of discrimination of

484
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,360
queer people in general

485
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,039
so in our case work at gsf we try to

486
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,199
really look at three aspects in order to

487
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,799
make a good strategic litigation

488
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,640
and number one is i think it's very

489
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,320
important to make the voices of those

490
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,799
hurt that are actually affected

491
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,159
so in our cases the two queer families

492
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,840
that we're fighting with

493
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,919
they have talked to media and they have

494
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,918
had their story heard and impact and

495
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,160
touch many people out there

496
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,160
and then secondly strategic litigation

497
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,960
is only one way of going about

498
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,080
the bigger idea of challenging societal

499
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,080
norms for example

500
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,199
so we partner up with civil society

501
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,639
organizations

502
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,240
in this case major lgbtqi organizations

503
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,039
and initiatives

504
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,960
and they work on these subjects in

505
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,679
different ways much more broadly but

506
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,600
also just with

507
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,600
different methods and then thirdly

508
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,439
litigation takes time and we're prepared

509
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,918
to stick with it

510
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,440
to continue this important work we need

511
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,919
your support

512
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:53,840
so join us in our fight for human rights

513
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,840
and become a supporting member

themselves so on the workshop area

539
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,360
on the workshop page on rc3.world

540
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,200
there's a introduction about themselves

541
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,080
so please read that if you're interested

542

peace and social responsibility

548
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:00,080
they want to focus on the effects that

549
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:02,799
information technology has on society

550
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,480
and for that they do public relations

551
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,600
work they do consulting they produce

552
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,760
tech studies

553
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,918
they publish a journal they do a

554
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,158
conference that was shown in the video

558
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,480

demonstration

561
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,039
yeah and i wanted to say something about

562
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,799
freifenk because

563
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,399
video was in german too maybe there were

564
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,720
subtitles um

565
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,520
freifen stands for free and open

566
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,960

communities all over germany

570
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,240
and one of the points they have all

571
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,959
together is

572
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,159
the networks are open for everyone and

573
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,799
the initiatives are

non-commercial and there are also some

575

video surveillance net politics

599
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:02,799
um cardos has talked about

600
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,480
some devices they built and

601
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,000
i think there are a lot of interesting

602
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,120
things you can find

603
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,679
under this url and um

604
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,639
enjoy it all the videos are streamed via

605
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,200
this channel and

606
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,000
they will be recorded and you can also

607
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,799
look them

608
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:24,240
look up them afterwards so now vic

609
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:26,639
how do does all this work in our

610
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,320
orbit this time yeah it's a bit

611
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,960
different from the last year so

612
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,720
obviously there's no audience but our

613
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,760
audience you hopefully listening to us

614
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,000
sits anywhere in the world so we thought

615
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,760
of

616
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,559
some ways how you can participate still

617
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,919
even under these different circumstances

618
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,158
so the first step is

619
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,440
finding the talks you want to listen to

620
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,720
and the

621
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,840
um the far plan ani already told

622
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,399
you is on farplan.o.social so there you

623
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,760
can look

624
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,360
at the talks and look at the

625
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,679
descriptions and see what talks you want

626
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,959
to

627
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,840
listen to the second step is to be in

628
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,320
the audience

629
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,678
so we have the the beam is set up that

630
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,879
we already mentioned

631
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,840
so please join the jitsi i think it's a

632
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,120
jetty room

633
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,320
under that link so that you can be

634
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,120
displayed in this room um and be seen by

635
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,760
the speakers

636
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,559
so they don't feel that alone standing

637
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,158
here on the page

638
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,000
on the stage because it's really that

639
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,000
many people in this um

640
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,840
hall and i think it's much easier for

641
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,640
speakers to have their presentations if

642
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,840
they see

643
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,559
some visual feedback of people actually

644
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,559
listening

645
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,879
so so that's something yeah what you can

646
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:40,399
do and how you can participate in it

647
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,399
and help speakers make it feel more like

648
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,799
an actual conference

649
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,559
the third step is if you have a question

650
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,519
of course you want to ask that question

651
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,480
and you can

652
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:54,159
so we have three ways of contacting us

653
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,159
there's an isc channel it's called

654
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,120
rc3-uyo

655
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,799
at the hack and rsc server

656
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,279
and on twitter and mastodon you can

657
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,519
contact and send us questions over the

658
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:09,039
hashtag rc3

659
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:12,720
oyo and um these communications

660
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:15,760
channels are monitored by people here

661
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,000
um with us and the the questions are

662
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,960
displayed for the q a sessions after all

663
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,320
the talks

664
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,240
um so that that's the way how you can

665
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,439
ask questions and then these questions

666
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:30,480
will be answered by the speakers

667
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,320
um step four after the talk in a

668
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,240
normal conference there would be some

669
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,000
people going to the speaker ask them

670
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,399
questions

671
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,200
we we don't want to miss out on that too

672
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,039
so there's a way to join a small discus

673
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,720
to join a discussion around with the

674
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,559
speaker after the talk

675
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,120
which is hosted on

676
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:51,279
discussion.rc3.oru.social

677
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,799
where you can join that room after a

678
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,000
talk and

679
00:32:52,799 --> 00:33:00,720
ask some additional questions

680
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,720
the speaker and yeah have a conversation

681
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,039
that's it for the talks for the

682
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,720
workshops there's also a url where you

683
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,879
can find the workshop space

684
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,039
which is unfortunately only for people

685
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,320
who have tickets because posted in a big

686
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,279
blue button room

687
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,600
which is hosted in the rc3 world so you
