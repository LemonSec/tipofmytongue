2
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,359
you have a disability

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,400
and assistive tech solutions for that

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,880
are either

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,159
unavailable in your country or extremely

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,720
expensive

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,400
or they come in a terrible hospital

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,640
light green

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,960
the team of caribbels.org has been

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,960
tackling this problem since three years

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,480
and today they will present an insight

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,320
into their journey

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,559
we're really happy to have aprica here

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,760
today who will give you an overview over

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,919
their journey

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,680
their actions their key moments and how

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,079
they were able to help people

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,680
we're really glad to have you here today

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,320
thank you so much

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,519
and it's so exciting to be here on the

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,039
stage

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,239
and i'm presenting today caribou's

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,280
open source hardware for care we

24
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,360
went on a journey three years ago to

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,840
explore how to co-create

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,280
open hardware for care to create an open

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,799
hardware platform

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,000
and to bring different people together

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,280
to create

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,280
these solutions together

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,080
and first i want to say quickly what a

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,439
caribbean is

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,679
and thankfully most has already been

34
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,079
said so it's co-created

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,600
with those people who need it so if

36
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,399
you're a person with disability

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,720
or with a person with a temporary or

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,479
chronic illness

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,158
you have specific needs and you are the

40
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,439
expert about your

41
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,240
needs so makers designers

42
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,639
people in healthcare create together

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,520
then

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,799
it's replicable and adaptable for the

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,798
individual need

46
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,880
in the local hackerspace or in a local

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,439
makerspace of hablab

48
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,640
and lastly and most importantly i think

49
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,559
as well

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,759
it's open and documented so we have an

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,240
open platform

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,680
where you can upload and download open

53
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,119
hardware designs

54
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,280
get inspired and where you can see

55
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,840
which solutions there are that might fit

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,840
your needs

57
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,160
and why do we need this because the

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,280
solutions

59
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,799
sometimes don't exist because they're

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,720
very often super expensive and

61
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,680
often also unfortunately stigmatizing or

62
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,280
just wrongly designed and not so

63
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,959
beautiful like we would want

64
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,959
them to be

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,879
i'm standing here on the stage but i'm

66
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,280
representing a global community of

67
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,679
people who are creating these caribous

68
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,440
um here you see the members of the

69
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,879
global innovation gathering

70
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,280
an association registered in berlin but

71
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,160
spread across the whole world a little

72
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,480
bit maybe

73
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,159
comparable to a chaos computer club

74
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,440
airfares

75
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,560
like a knowledge exchange group that

76
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,280
comes together

77
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,920
and where you see people who are in

78
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,680
basra

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,440
in iraq have very similar problems to

80
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,159
people who are in south sudan for

81
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,239
example and creating a hackerspace there

82
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:21,280
or if you are in nairobi you have um

83
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,480
yeah things to discuss with people who

84
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,040
are in brazil in olinda for example so

85
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,798
that's

86
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,280
how we come together and

87
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,599
that's also a tiny map of where

88
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,720
caribou's activities already started to

89
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,679
be

90
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,720
taking shape and we are like now in the

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,080
stage of opening up to everybody

92
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,680
who wants to become part of that

93
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,040
and i want to give you a little bit of

94
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,040
an insight into

95
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:58,159
into the different projects

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,280
we are creating and in the different

97
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,120
in the different um yeah products

98
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,680
created and the different events

99
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,599
created and because i'm only standing

100
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,080
here for such a huge

101
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,920
number of amazing people and their

102
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,400
communities

103
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:19,279
i bring mostly videos they send to us

104
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,880
from their events and i'm starting with

105
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,320
a very inspiring video

106
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,199
from berlin that had world premiere

107
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,639
last year at the congress so i'm happy

108
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,160
to now show it in an

109
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:36,000
even better version and i will start

110
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,040
now so

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,840
you see the open health academy

112
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,840
and what happens there

113
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
is

114
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,679
[Music]

115
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
um

116
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
foreign

117
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,729
[Music]

118
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
foreign

119
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,840
so you see all the solutions created

120
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,919
here had the beginning

121
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,840
and the need of the person who wanted to

122
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,039
have it like sven who wanted to ride a

123
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,799
bicycle but couldn't

124
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,719
so that's at core of everything we tried

125
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,520
to do

126
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,120
and as everybody knows during coveted

127
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,639
pandemic

128
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,680
we had lots of people all over the world

129
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,919
creating protective equipment

130
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,880
personal protective equipment also here

131
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,840
in berlin

132
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,319
but also all around the world and here i

133
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,400
bring an example from kumasi hive in

134
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,720
ghana

135
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,679
where the makers and the makerspace also

136
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,840
created

137
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,160
lots of face shields for example

138
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,840
and we still were thinking that face

139
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,880
shields were super important

140
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,840
for protection and also

141
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,800
of course for medical field so in komasi

142
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,198
hive

143
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:46,240
they were already connecting to local

144
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,199
hospital for people with disability and

145
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,960
also with

146
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,120
engineering students and worked with

147
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,159
lots of people in these regards

148
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,599
but also had to see that they can't

149
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,840
access the makerspace

150
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,719
so there were only always a few people

151
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,758
allowed

152
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,520
to enter the makerspace

153
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,039
but still they created lots and lots of

154
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,599
these ppes

155
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:14,960
and these face shields and other helpful

156
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,840
equipment and they also were part of the

157
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,758
caribbean

158
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,119
seeks to empower people living with

159
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,360
disability

160
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,039
by removing the barrier of the lack of

161
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,919
assistive devices

162
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,240
the project is in two phases training

163
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,639
and co-creation which culminates in a

164
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,959
hackathon and kitchen summit

165
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,560
manufacturing and incubation

166
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,640
trainees for the program have been

167
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,559
selected they have been taken through

168
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,679
intensive and interactive training

169
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,880
sessions on product

170
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,519
design 3d modeling and fabrication

171
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,160
and material selection this training is

172
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,000
done in person and veterans

173
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,079
a virtual challenge to engage and

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
evaluate the skills of trainees in 3d

remodeling and fabrication

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,839
and material selection has been launched

177
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,600
and trainees are working on many

178
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,240
projects in teams

179
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,240
teams will develop a investor door knob

180
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,240
lever that easily converts a standard

181
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,160
door knob into a liver handle

182
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,920
people with difficulty gripping a

183
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,519
standard doorknob should find this

184
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,399
adapted liver handle

185
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,320
an easy way to open a door the handle

186
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,839
should be ideal for anyone who has

187
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,000
weak hands osteoporosis or arthritis

188
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,680
designed by a team will be shared on all

189
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,519
our social media platforms

190
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,519
for our online community booth for the

191
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
best

192
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,839

[Music]

195
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:09,519
together with students mostly to

196
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,760
work on these kinds of new designs but

197
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,760
also reproducing

198
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,600
designs that were already published on

199
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,040
the platform and on the internet

200
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,560
generally

201
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,959
and they have opening

202
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,359
they are opening very soon the very

203
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:29,279
first fab lab in nepal

204
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,560
so for them it was also a really good

205
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,600
case to show the community around their

206
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,399
region

207
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,360
that a fab lab and the tools and the

208
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,920
machines

209
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:44,480
and just creating things personally

210
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,370
can help a lot in the local community

211
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,800
and it's not only about

212
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,200
[Music]

213
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,519
learning but also creating something in

214
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,519
the end

215
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,839
there were lots of iterations of course

216
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:05,120
and in the end they published this

217
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:08,320
as open knowledge again for everybody

218
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,839
and also for example work together with

219
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,839
a local

220
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,920
hospital for people with disabilities

221
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,279
where pallab from nepal community

222
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,959
could help the local engineers

223
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,760
to work together in the hospital to fix

224
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,319
their 3d printers for example and this

225
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,319
is polyp

226
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,640
to fix 3d printers and to work together

227
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,439
to

228
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,439
create designs they needed in this

229
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
hospital

230
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:10,239
now we also see what they did during the

231
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:13,439
humanitarian design challenge

232
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,440
[Music]

233
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,200
and we will also of course publish the

234
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,839
videos so you can revisit them

235
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,839
and see what you can take from it for

236
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
example

237
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,980
[Music]

238
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,439
some of you also might have heard about

239
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,200
um

240
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:42,560
which is an organization that creates

241
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,760
this kind of capacity building

242
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,839
workshops but also was known like from

243
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,439
the beginning on for 3d printing and

244
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,500
humanitarian aid

245
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,399
so creating

246
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:57,600
[Music]

247
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,639
and also to collaborate

248
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,200
a lot with ngos on the ground in a

249
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:06,959
certain humanitarian situation

250
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:10,560
so that yeah the capacity

251
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:14,479
to build nowadays they are

252
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:17,119
mainly also creating

253
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,720
for example makerspaces in different

254
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,839
areas of the world

255
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,839
like in iraq

256
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,279
and if you're interested to create such

257
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,599
a

258
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,360
design sprint or other co-creation

259
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,320
events yourself

260
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,800
we also publish the the blueprints for

261
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,920
that

262
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,120
so that you can say the ideation the

263
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,680
empathy

264
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,199
the prototyping i don't have so much

265
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,040
ideas about that

266
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:53,359
can you help me and you can read these

267
00:13:51,040 --> 00:14:03,760
introductions and then also try it out

268
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:06,079
yourself in your hackerspace

269
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,560
oh this was nepal which was very

270
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,560
exciting

271
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,199
next is casa cliatura lab in olinda in

272
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,160
brazil

273
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,719
and they they've also been working a lot

274
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:31,839
in the

275
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:31,839
comfort response

276
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
foreign

277
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,439
[Music]

278
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,520
[Music]

279
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:43,470
[Music]

280
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,160
so this is the last one and it's

281
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,239
something for

282
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,920
all the 3d printing nerds among us

283
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,839
[Music]

284
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,519
and also in milan as you know

285
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,199
in the beginning of the pandemic there

286
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,000
was yeah

287
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,000
a huge hit

288
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:16,839
yeah very struck and so

289
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:19,839
they were mass producing

290
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
also

291
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,179
[Music]

292
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,160
such a nice idea

293
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:39,440
so this was our very small world tour

294
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,879
of places that contributed

295
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,000
a lot to carables there's

296
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,559
many many more to show of course but we

297
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,919
tried to limit ourselves a little bit we

298
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,000
created an exhibition

299
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,480
that you can exhibit in your makerspace

300
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,600
so in your hackerspace

301
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:01,760
we created much more material of course

302
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:06,959
that you can use

303
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,960
and it's just so nice again

304
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:16,240
yeah so they also mass produced so much

305
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,240
what you see now in the box

306
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,559
and also work together of course with

307
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,600
hospitals and with other people who

308
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,879
really used

309
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:29,280
and needed these materials like

310
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:32,640
many others did

311
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,480
so if you want you can become part of

312
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,280
the caribbean's community you can send

328
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,400
if anybody wants to have um

329
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,400
yeah the european union is supporting

330
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,760
lots of different innovation programs

331
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,960
and also this one

332
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:28,879
so thanks a lot for that

333
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,480
cool so far we haven't gotten any

334
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,520
questions from the internet if you are

335
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,600
watching this and

336
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,799
right now you think of a question please

337
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,120
ask it um over the usual channels

338
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,879
um and in the meantime i thought of

339
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,159
maybe maybe it's interesting for for

340
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,559
more people

341
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,280
how did that get started so is it

342
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,440
traceable

343
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,639
to to a circle of people who sat around

344
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,240
the table and were like

345
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,039
yes this is what we need to do there's

346
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,840
this problem and it needs to be tackled

347
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,520
yeah there's assistive tech communities

348
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,320
all around the world

349
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,559
working for example in humanitarian aid

350
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,480
or in humanitarian collaboration

351
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,480
where you see field ready is working for

352
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,640
a long time already cardos is working

353
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,320
for a long time already

354
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,799
in this field of creating your own

355
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,760
solutions for medical purposes for

356
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,559
example

357
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,000
then there's assistive tech communities

358
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,520
from people with disabilities

359
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,640
for example just creating their own

360
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,200
tools that they need for example i don't

361
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,360
know

362
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,559
enhancements for your wheelchair or

363
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,760
other things

364
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,879
and then there was a group

365
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:40,240
from the um

366
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,000
society in amsterdam meeting

367
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,159
geraldine one of the founders of the

368
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,240
global innovation gathering

369
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,799
in brazil in olenna i think or in rio

370
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,840
at a really amazing event and they spoke

371
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,320
about

372
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,039
what can you do and there's this grand

373
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,678
opening

374
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,960
um from the european union where you can

375
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:03,200
apply for with like

376
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:06,000
50 pages or 70 pages of proposal

377
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,919
and we were always in contact also with

378
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,640
the public in berlin and with lots of

379
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,600
people

380
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,640
from the hacker community of course and

381
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,678
found

382
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:21,440
people in milan who were closely related

383
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,120
with a center for the rehabilitation for

384
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,679
children with disability

385
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,399
mainly neurological diseases and they

386
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,080
had

387
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,240
such yeah beautiful products as well

388
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,320
that you could just reproduce for other

389
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,559
children and so they all

390
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,720
came together and thought yeah we can

391
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,520
create that proposal we can create that

392
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,320
platform

393
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,600
because back four or five years ago

394
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,840
there wasn't so many

395
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,360
open hardware platforms yet where you

396
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,480
could really dedicate it

397
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,360
find assistive tech solutions but you

398
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,159
would have

399
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,879
all these general platforms you all know

400
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,000
where you

401
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,400
find door handles but also small ships

402
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,520
and anything else that you could

403
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,960
possibly

404
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,600
3d print and so um the idea to have this

405
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,600
platform

406
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:13,039
dedicated for medical and for

407
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,439
assistive tech use was born

408
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,559
to have a place to collect this all and

409
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,120
to

410
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:22,480
have a place that is maybe also more

411
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,479
accessible for people that is more

412
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,559
accessible for example also for people

413
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,120
in the medical field who maybe don't

414
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,918
want to

415
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,559
scroll through all the ships and all the

416
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,919
other

417
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,600
tiny gadgets you can print so that was

418
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,080
the idea and then

419
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,120
we won the grand and we could start it

420
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,559
and now

421
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,678
the grand period is over and now we um

422
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:48,000
expand it to um yeah whoever wants to

423
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,559
contribute

424
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,919
cool yeah thank you for the insight for

425
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,280
the explanations

426
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,240
um maybe as a last thing i think

427
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,559
no question so far um could you give us

428
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,039
some

429
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,678
outlook so something if everything goes

430
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,679
great

431
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,679
what has happened in five years or what

432
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,960
where do you aim to get

433
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,240
um everybody knows how to create their

434
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,720
own

435
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,120
assistive tech and it's empowered to do

436
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,880
so for example through

437
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:23,439
online course and how to create designs

438
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:25,760
in cid programs for example

439
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,679
people in the medical field are

440
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,679
knowledgeable about what is possible

441
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:35,039
and for example people in the um

442
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,679
physical therapy or

443
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,360
like in this in these areas know about

444
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,840
what's possible technically

445
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,760
and are connected and of course

446
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,279
everybody is just putting everything on

447
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,279
the caribbean's platform but i mean

448
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:50,559
there are more open hardware platforms

449
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:55,440
out there now which is great

450
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:57,840
and so we're more collecting also and

451
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,559
yeah open open source hardware is

452
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,158
advanced

453
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:05,520
so like right to repair super important

454
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:09,360
aspect that you're the owner

455
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,520
of your own devices i don't know if

456
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,360
many people know it but if you're a

457
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,200
person with in a wheelchair for example

458
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,520
you're not the owner of your wheelchair

459
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,159
but

460
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,039
your health insurance is and so all

461
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,279
these

462
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,158
there's so many problems in this field

463
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,320
we're trying to tackle a tiny bit of it

464
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,840
and we hope that more people feel

465
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,039
inspired and

466
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:34,240
empowered to um work in the field

467
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:37,120
and we're also having a talk tomorrow

468
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,159
in the main program which is super

469
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,039
exciting

470
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,240
as well to reflect a bit on the last

471
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,720
three years

472
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,600
as well and to give an outlook of what's

473
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,279
coming

474
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,879
in the next next step okay

475
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,120
thank you for all the explanations that

476
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,080
sounds like a very good future

477
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,959
we will continue at seven o'clock with

478
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,918
the next talk

479
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,600
until we had then we have a dinner break

480
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:15,840
thank you so much for being here today

481
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:15,840
thank you so much for having me bye

482
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:26,240
