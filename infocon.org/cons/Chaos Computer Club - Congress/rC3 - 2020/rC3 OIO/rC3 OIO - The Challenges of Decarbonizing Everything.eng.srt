[Music]

2
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,000
today the fact

3
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,679
that there's a climate crisis and that

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,280
we absolutely need to reduce

5
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,600
our carbon emissions is pretty clear but

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,520
are the different co2 sources equally

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,079
easy to decarbonize

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,719
and do we have enough electricity to

9
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,879
replace carbon-based energy sources

10
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,920
the stakes are high we are talking about

11
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,120
nothing less than

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,680
saving the world in the next talk

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,640
hanobuk who is a journalist and security

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,960
researcher

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,000
will give us answers to these questions

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,199
hano we're really

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,199
happy to have you here today

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,720
hello my name is sanu i'm a journalist

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,520
and i have lately

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,000
covered a lot more topics around climate

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,798
change and the energy transition

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,600
and in this talk i want to highlight a

23
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,520
few things

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,880
that i think are particularly

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,479
challenging

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,479
in this area yeah so

27
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,080
why are we talking about this i mean

28
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,360
obviously i guess

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,039
um everybody knows that um we're in a

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,720
climate emergency and

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,000
um it is necessary that we do something

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,360
about it

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,079
so we need to stop greenhouse gas

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,840
emissions

35
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,679
and on at least on the medium to long

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,000
term we really need to

37
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,439
stop all greenhouse gas emissions and

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,079
move to a

39
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:58,559
zero emissions economy and

40
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,479
usually when people think about stopping

41
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,079
greenhouse gas emissions about tackling

42
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,880
climate change

43
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,158
they they think about things like this

44
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,840
like

45
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,959
um yeah okay we have um things like coal

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,599
power plants

47
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:18,239
um or other fossil powered power plants

48
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,959
and we move away we need to move away

49
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,200
from that

50
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:27,920
and build up a renewable energy like

51
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,920
primarily wind and solar

52
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,599
or you might also think about something

53
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,200
like this

54
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:38,238
that today we have cars that are

55
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,599
driven with with fossil fuels

56
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,959
essentially and we want to move away

57
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,518
from that

58
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,040
on the one hand to electric vehicles but

59
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,160
of course we can also

60
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,959
think about moving to other modes of

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,640
transport

62
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,239
like trains which are in a lot of cases

63
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,359
already electric

64
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:04,480
or also to improving the situation for

65
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:07,519
cycling and walking um

66
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,879
i mean all of that is is good this

67
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,680
helps a lot um this is um

68
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,640
yeah this tackles a huge part of the

69
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,959
problem

70
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,518
but that's kind of the bad news is that

71
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,760
this was the easy part and there's a lot

72
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,599
more that we need to decarbonize we need

73
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,040
to move to zero emissions

74
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,040
that is much more challenging

75
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,720
so we have we have

76
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,200
emissions in industry for example in

77
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,400
steel production or in cement

78
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,079
and we have things like aviation or also

79
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,200
things like the production of

80
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,760
chemicals and plastics that are

81
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,440
very challenging when we want to move to

82
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,280
when we want to reduce emissions there

83
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,879
or even get rid of emissions

84
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,720
um so when we think about moving to a

85
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,480
climate neutral economy

86
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:07,439
usually the idea people have is that

87
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,840
it's basically two steps the first is

88
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,079
that

89
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,200
okay we need to clean up our electricity

90
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,519
production

91
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,879
we need to move away from coal and gas

92
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,720
to

93
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:21,759
primarily renewables and also

94
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,600
then as a next step we need to move all

95
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,199
other uses of energy

96
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,530
to electricity so we need to electrify

97
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,560
almost everything

98
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:36,000
[Music]

99
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,160
so to get a bit of an idea what cleaning

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,600
up electricity means

101
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,880
right now we have roughly

102
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,639
a worldwide electricity production of 26

103
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,440
petawatt hours per year

104
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,199
so that is all the electricity in all

105
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,080
the power plants in the world

106
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,600
this is a number from 2018 which is like

107
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,159
the last year where

108
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,720
there are these statistics it's also of

109
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,120
course obviously a non-corona year

110
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,400
like this year is is obviously very

111
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,400
special

112
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,599
um and i i want to come back to this

113
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,198
a bit during the talk as a reference

114
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,520
because i think this is something we can

115
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,639
imagine like all the electricity that is

116
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,320
produced today

117
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,560
because later on i will say in certain

118
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,919
situations if we want to move this to

119
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,080
electricity

120
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,198
then we will need that much electricity

121
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,919
and that is

122
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,880
that much percent of today's electricity

123
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,840
production because i think that's just a

124
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,719
a good way to visualize how big the

125
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,719
challenges are

126
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,759
um yeah um how's this electricity today

127
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,840
produced

128
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,960
um here's a little chart uh so

129
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,479
the black thing which is unfortunately

130
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,599
still the biggest chunk

131
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,680
is electricity production from coal

132
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,440
and then we also have a big chunk of

133
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,160
natural gas

134
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,560
and the the thing where you want to move

135
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,319
to

136
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,440
is the stuff in the upper right like the

137
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,600
light blue one is wind energy which is

138
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,120
still relatively small but it's it's

139
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,319
rapidly growing

140
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,440
and solar which is uh the light yellow

141
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,840
part which is even smaller but it's

142
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,880
growing even more rapidly then we have

143
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,560
some hydropower

144
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,960
which is um it depends a bit on the

145
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,400
situation but it's mostly

146
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,880
uh relatively good but

147
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:38,799
it will probably not not grow massively

148
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,680
yeah here's a chart which

149
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,919
shows the development of prices of

150
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,639
electricity production and this is one

151
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,000
of the

152
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,199
things that is very promising

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,759
and that is if you look at this red line

154
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,000
which

155
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:59,199
uh visualizes the price of solar energy

156
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,919
that has gone down very massively and we

157
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,960
have another

158
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,198
this dark blue line which is for wind

159
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,638
energy for onshore wind energy so wind

160
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,240
energy built on the land

161
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:13,599
not in the sea um that has also

162
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,960
gotten very very cheap so

163
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,880
this is uh this is good right so

164
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,359
renewable energy particularly wind and

165
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,199
solar they've gotten really cheap

166
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,479
uh prices were reduced massively so

167
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,520
we can build up more of it and um

168
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,639
move in the right direction with that um

169
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,440
what uh may is also interesting in this

170
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,400
chart is

171
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,759
this uh green line which is the price of

172
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,239
nuclear which is actually

173
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,080
the form of energy that has the biggest

174
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,919
increase in prices so

175
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,400
building nuclear power plants is getting

176
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,520
more expensive and not cheaper

177
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,198
which uh maybe one should keep in mind

178
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,758
in discussions because some people

179
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,199
consider nuclear a very important part

180
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,400
of future solutions

181
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:05,039
and maybe just without even going into a

182
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,479
discussion about safety or any of that

183
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,560
uh just the idea of uh of

184
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,240
considering an energy form that is

185
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,599
expensive and is getting even more

186
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,800
expensive

187
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,039
if we want to move quickly to cleaner

188
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,080
forms of energy maybe it's

189
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,080
not the best idea

190
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,719
so yeah so cleaning up the electricity

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,560
sector

192
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,959
it is still a huge task but

193
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,839
the thing is we we mostly know how to do

194
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,478
it we

195
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,000
need to remove to renewables of course

196
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,800
there are still challenges around

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,479
storage

198
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:46,160
and flexibility but i guess these are

199
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,880
it's it it seems doable

200
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,480
and it's and the large part of the past

201
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,480
it's clear what we need to do

202
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,000
um but then there are more challenges

203
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,320
ahead

204
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,680
and that is uh getting all the other

205
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,360
sectors to also

206
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,599
decarbonize um one

207
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,399
sector that is particularly challenging

208
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,040
is

209
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:13,279
steel production so what you can see

210
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,279
here is a so-called blast furnace

211
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:22,880
an industrial plant to produce steel

212
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,040
and the steel production is currently

213
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,680
responsible for around seven percent of

214
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,800
the

215
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,680
carbon dioxide emissions in the world

216
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,959
and that is uh and usually steel is

217
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,319
produced using coal

218
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,800
so and something to

219
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,560
that is important to know here is that

220
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,439
the emissions from steel production

221
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,680
that's not

222
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,640
simply energy it's not simply we burn

223
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,680
the coal to need

224
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,640
some heat or or to to drive some process

225
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,279
but

226
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,040
it is actually the chemistry within this

227
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,880
steel blast furnace

228
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,199
that is causing the carbon dioxide

229
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,920
emissions

230
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,000
um i i thought about writing down the

231
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,000
chemical formulas but for steel

232
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,120
they are relatively complicated so i

233
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,680
will

234
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,839
a i think but the important part is to

235
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,839
get the basic idea that

236
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,600
what is happening here is that what we

237
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,640
put into such a steel plant

238
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,920
is carbon in the form of coal which is

239
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,640
mostly carbon

240
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,279
and we put in iron oxide so that is a

241
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,480
chemical

242
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:30,480
that is a binding of oxygen atoms

243
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,839
and iron atoms and what we get out is

244
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,240
carbon dioxide and pure iron

245
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,240
so and the carbon dioxide comes out in

246
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,360
the form of emissions and goes into the

247
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,440
atmosphere

248
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,480
and that is causing these high emissions

249
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,480
from steel production

250
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,200
um so if we want to move away from that

251
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,920
the technology that is currently seems

252
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,320
to be most

253
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,640
promising is something called direct

254
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,000
reduced iron with

255
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:03,439
hydrogen um

256
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,640
so there's already uh there are already

257
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,399
uh some steel plants it's um

258
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,399
around seven percent of the worldwide

259
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,120
production that are using

260
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,680
natural gas instead of coal and they're

261
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,079
using something called direct reduction

262
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,959
so with natural gas it's still a fossil

263
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,800
fuel

264
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,279
it's still causing carbon emissions

265
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:28,240
they're a bit lower than from coal but

266
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:31,839
not that much actually um

267
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,760
but uh the good thing here is that

268
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,440
you can actually replace this natural

269
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,880
gas with hydrogen

270
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,000
and it seems technically this is only a

271
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,920
relatively small

272
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,519
change so we have an existing technology

273
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,920
that that is known how to operate

274
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,600
and you can switch off the natural gas

275
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,800
for hydrogen

276
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:59,760
and get a cleaner process there um

277
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,199
there's an uh there's a project from

278
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,920
some swedish companies

279
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,240
the hybrid project which is currently

280
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,199
the

281
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,240
most ambitious plan to implement such

282
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,160
hydrogen-based steel production it is

283
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,800
run by the by ssab which is a

284
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,000
big steel producer both in sweden and in

285
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,399
finland

286
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,440
and lk ab which is the steel mining

287
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,920
company

288
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,800
and button file which is the swedish

289
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,319
state

290
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,319
electricity company

291
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,240
and they have announced this last year

292
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,680
and in a press release

293
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,720
ssab said that they actually

294
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:45,120
their goal is that to have the

295
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:48,320
company fossil free in the year 2045

296
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,120
at the latest now we can argue that

297
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,880
uh you could say maybe this is too late

298
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,800
because if we really take

299
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,720
the climate goal seriously then we need

300
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,519
to move much faster

301
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,720
uh but still at least this this is an

302
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,639
ambitious goal because

303
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,399
we're talking about an industry that

304
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,639
basically

305
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,760
hasn't done much to reduce carbon

306
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,760
emissions until now

307
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,279
um and right now there is

308
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,240
quite a lot of momentum about this

309
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,079
hydrogen-based steel production so this

310
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,160
the swedish project is not the only

311
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,479
project there are also a number of

312
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,519
for example german companies that are

313
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,079
currently uh

314
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,160
working on on pilot projects for

315
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,199
hydrogen-based steel

316
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,279
um and what i find interesting about is

317
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,320
this is that there seems to be really

318
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,040
currently

319
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,760
a push from the industry that they want

320
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,079
to have it

321
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,519
and also a push from actually labor

322
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,399
unions that say

323
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,040
we want to go into that direction which

324
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,320
is

325
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,160
quite different from some other

326
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,560
industries where you often have

327
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,959
both the industry and the labor unions

328
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,479
more and putting the brakes on

329
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,079
like if you think in the car industry uh

330
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,000
they are not the ones who want to move

331
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,319
it forward to a more

332
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,040
time friendly production but in still

333
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,680
this seems to be different right now and

334
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,160
i i mean you can we can discuss why this

335
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,920
is

336
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:17,600
the case uh and obviously they are not

337
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,479
not just doing this out of concern about

338
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,279
the world but

339
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,880
also the steel companies just hope that

340
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,880
they will get a lot of

341
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,279
state support for this hydrogen-based

342
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,399
steel which may give them a competitive

343
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,399
advantage

344
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,800
but still i find it interesting that

345
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,720
that here seems to be a push from

346
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,719
industry to move this forward

347
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,399
now we may wonder if we use hydrogen and

348
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,680
if we produce that hydrogen from

349
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,320
electricity

350
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,760
which is like the way you want to do it

351
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,800
if we want to

352
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,800
get climate-friendly hydrogen how much

353
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,479
electricity would we need for that

354
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,160
and i i've done a calculation here so

355
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,959
i've calculated this myself

356
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,880
just for transparency but i have taken

357
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,399
the numbers from the swedish hybrid

358
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,720
project because they

359
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,760
they have published numbers about the

360
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,639
what they

361
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,600
expect the electricity per ton of steel

362
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,079
to be

363
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,120
and then i have taken numbers from the

364
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,279
current

365
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,399
world steel production and if you

366
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,480
multiply

367
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,720
the additional electricity required for

368
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,519
this hydrogen-based steel process

369
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,680
you end up with something around six

370
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,440
petabot hours per year

371
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:35,279
um and this is um around 23

372
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:38,639
of the world electricity production so

373
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,000
this is i mean it's a lot it it's

374
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,160
around a quarter of the world

375
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,480
electricity production that

376
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,319
you would have to add and then move to

377
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,839
clean electricity in order to clean up

378
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,560
the steel sector

379
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,399
but still it kind of seems doable like

380
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,239
it's not something that

381
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,240
seems completely implausible to do

382
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,320
so as we said just that we we can move

383
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,638
steel to hydrogen and the same

384
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,519
is true for quite a few other sectors so

385
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,600
hydrogen is

386
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,440
is considered a very promising option in

387
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,680
a lot of

388
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,199
sectors we should talk a bit about

389
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,800
hydrogen in general

390
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,639
so because um

391
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,639
even though hydrogen is very often

392
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,680
touted as a climate solution

393
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,880
right now it's also a very big source of

394
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,920
of greenhouse gas emissions

395
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,160
um so today we have um

396
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,599
around 70 million tons of hydrogen in

397
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,839
use and

398
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:40,720
another 45 million tons that are used

399
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,399
in mixed gases so you have applications

400
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,040
where there's pure hydrogen and then

401
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,199
there's

402
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,240
some applications where you just use

403
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,839
hydrogen

404
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,160
mixed with other substances in the

405
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,720
industry

406
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,120
and almost all of it comes from fossil

407
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,120
fuels

408
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:03,680
and there are two sectors that are

409
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,240
the main consumers of hydrogen today

410
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,799
and that is for one ammonia production

411
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,679
which is

412
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,839
a gas that is actually used for

413
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,079
fertilizer production

414
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,198
and the other big user are oil

415
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,678
refineries

416
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,199
they are actually using it to remove

417
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,919
sulfur from

418
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,919
raw oil

419
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,520
and the the main process that is used

420
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,720
today to

421
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,679
generate this hydrogen is a

422
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,320
method called steam methane reforming so

423
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,679
methane

424
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:41,840
is the main component of natural gas

425
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:45,039
so or fossil gas um

426
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,000
and this this process is splitting up

427
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,400
the methane which

428
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,559
is the chemical formula is ch4 so it's

429
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:57,039
carbon and hydrogen and then we get

430
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,918
hydrogen and co2 which causes the

431
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,720
emissions

432
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,760
there's also some hydrogen production

433
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,160
from coal

434
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,879
uh some from oil and it's also sometimes

435
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,480
a byproduct in other processes

436
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:14,160
particularly in chlorine production

437
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,799
um but really the the

438
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,039
the major method is this the methane

439
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,320
reforming so natural gas is the major

440
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,600
source of hydrogen

441
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,159
production today um

442
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,719
and this hydrogen production which is

443
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,720
mostly

444
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,400
from fossil fuels it's responsible for

445
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,120
830 million tons of carbon dioxide per

446
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,120
year

447
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,280
which is around two percent of the

448
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,479
carbon dioxide emissions today

449
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,480
so that that's quite a significant

450
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,919
amount of greenhouse gas emissions from

451
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,919
hydrogen production today

452
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,600
there are also some additional emissions

453
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,239
and uh

454
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,399
and particularly if you're using natural

455
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,720
gas basically in every process where you

456
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,120
use

457
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,400
natural gas you will also have methane

458
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,439
emissions and that is

459
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,760
just because there are leakages so

460
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,559
if you're if you're drilling for natural

461
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,280
gas

462
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,639
some of the gas will get out and will go

463
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,240
into the atmosphere

464
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,480
if you have pipelines if you have

465
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,600
compressors all the infrastructure for

466
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,640
natural gas

467
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,199
there's always a an amount of leakage

468
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,160
and methane itself is a very active

469
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,000
greenhouse gas

470
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,160
so if this natural gas gets into the

471
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,400
atmosphere that itself

472
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,400
is is a greenhouse gas

473
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,000
um and so so we have a lot of

474
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,240
greenhouse gas emissions from hydrogen

475
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,919
so if we want to have hydrogen

476
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,480
to be a climate solution then first

477
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,440
hydrogen itself needs to be cleaned up

478
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,720
we need a cleaner hydrogen production

479
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,200
and the the method that is usually

480
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,679
discussed here is electrolysis

481
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,080
electrolysis is a process where you

482
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,360
basically use electricity to split up

483
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,480
water

484
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,360
water is oxygen and hydrogen so if you

485
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,159
split that up

486
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,760
you get pure hydrogen and pure oxygen

487
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,960
what you can see on this picture

488
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,520
is an electrolyzer

489
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,360
from the company anatrax this is in

490
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,799
translau which is

491
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:22,959
north of berlin which is a pilot project

492
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,960
that was started around a decade ago

493
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,559
there are some other ideas how to to

494
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,120
have a cleaner hydrogen production

495
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,720
one of them is to still use this methane

496
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,799
reforming with natural gas

497
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,320
and combine that with with carbon

498
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:41,440
capture and storage

499
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,879
which means capturing the co2 emissions

500
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,039
and then maybe store them

501
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:49,520
in in geological formations underground

502
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,200
another method that is discussed is so

503
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,520
called pyrolysis

504
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,360
which means you're you're also using

505
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,240
natural gas and methane and then you're

506
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,399
breaking it up

507
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,840
but not into carbon dioxide but in in

508
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,360
pure carbon

509
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,600
uh and hydrogen but the problem with

510
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,120
these methods is that they very likely

511
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,360
don't provide any path to zero emissions

512
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,360
and the main reason for that is what i

513
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,000
mentioned earlier these

514
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,600
these leakage emissions from natural gas

515
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,760
you will always have these methane

516
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,240
emissions so

517
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,919
so it is questionable whether it

518
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,960
actually makes sense to go into these

519
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,200
directions

520
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,600
because we're not going to go to zero

521
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:35,440
emissions with these technologies

522
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:38,879
so electrolysis is promising but

523
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,640
currently the there's uh the amount of

524
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,640
hydrogen produced from electrolysis

525
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,000
is is really tiny it's in the lower

526
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,559
percentage area

527
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,840
the the numbers are a bit uncertain it

528
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,399
depends a bit on

529
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,879
on which source you take but it's not a

530
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,520
lot

531
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:58,400
it's really really tiny um

532
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,840
so before this can be significant it

533
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,840
needs to be scaled up a lot

534
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,720
and if we look at the electricity just

535
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,480
the electricity we would need if we

536
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,520
would move the current hydrogen

537
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,240
production to electrolysis

538
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,520
it would be around 3.6 petabyte hours

539
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,080
per year

540
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,200
this is a number i i got from a report

541
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,520
from the

542
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,360
international energy agency last year

543
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,520
they made a

544
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:32,639
an extensive report just on hydrogen

545
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,320
and that is around would be around 14

546
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,039
of the current world electricity

547
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,240
production so

548
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,919
so even just moving today's hydrogen

549
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,320
production to electrolysis

550
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,400
would be challenging now there's one

551
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,039
thing to remark here and that is that

552
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,200
a lot of the current hydrogen production

553
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,679
is used in the oil industry

554
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,280
and of course if we want to move to zero

555
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,640
carbon economy

556
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,360
then this needs to go away we no longer

557
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,480
want to

558
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,479
have an oil industry

559
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,039
but still there's a significant amount

560
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,280
that will be needed in the future

561
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:13,440
and if we think about all these other

562
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,440
areas where we want to move to hydrogen

563
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,039
and then we will need more hydrogen in

564
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,039
the future

565
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,559
another sector that is very challenging

566
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,919
to decarbonize

567
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:31,120
is aviation so um

568
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,720
yeah airplanes today they they run on

569
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,399
kerosene which is

570
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,600
a product made from oil uh aviation is

571
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,320
responsible for

572
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,279
uh around two percent of the co2

573
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,320
emissions

574
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,520
but uh it's important to know that this

575
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,600
is not

576
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,000
this is not the whole story of aviation

577
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,799
emissions um

578
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,679
and one reason for that is actually what

579
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,918
you can see here

580
00:23:53,679 --> 00:24:01,600
these contrails which are water vapor

581
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:04,480
so if you burn this kerosene some water

582
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,760
is produced and that is emitted as water

583
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,880
vapor

584
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,799
and um

585
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,320
this water vapor has a claimant impact

586
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,879
and there are other things

587
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,639
for example nitrous oxide emissions that

588
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,520
have a climate impact

589
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,880
and there's an eu research project the

590
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:26,240
clean sky project

591
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:28,640
that has uh recently published a report

592
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,559
and they have estimated in there that

593
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,279
the climate impact from aviation they

594
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,960
have asked

595
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,880
experts and looked at existing studies

596
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,559
that they estimated that between three

597
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,720
and seven percent

598
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,678
and this is really remarkable because

599
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,919
this is a

600
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,440
an uncertainty that is more than a

601
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,840
hundred percent

602
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,679
so um the so it seems really that

603
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,039
if you ask how big is the climate impact

604
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,880
of aviation

605
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,158
the answer is really we don't know very

606
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,760
well

607
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:02,000
there's a massive uncertainty and

608
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,080
the the biggest source of uncertainty is

609
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,400
actually these water vapor emissions

610
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,439
so water has multiple effects in the

611
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,440
atmosphere

612
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,559
it there are these contrails and then

613
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,080
also the water

614
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:17,120
it has impact on cloud formation

615
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,360
and this is actually very hard to model

616
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,559
and that is why there's just a lot of

617
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,559
uncertainty around this

618
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,199
um so yeah you might ask but

619
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,720
what can we do how could aviation become

620
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,640
more climate friendly how

621
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:37,840
can we get rid of these emissions and

622
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,960
it is challenging um

623
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:44,480
so you might consider okay

624
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:48,000
we use batteries to to electrify cars

625
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:51,039
maybe we can also use batteries for for

626
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,200
aviation um there

627
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,440
actually there's some effort in doing

628
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,400
that so particularly norway has

629
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,360
some ambitious plants here so the the

630
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,720
state

631
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:05,439
aviation company in norway avenue they

632
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,360
have actually plans to to go in that

633
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,559
direction and want to have their first

634
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,918
plane

635
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,320
uh ready in 2030 and they expect it to

636
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,039
be

637
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,520
somewhere between 300 400 kilometers of

638
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,879
reach

639
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,639
and space for 19 passengers and i guess

640
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,320
you you can see in which direction this

641
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,039
is going like this is doable

642
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,399
but we're talking here about relatively

643
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,799
short ranges

644
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,520
and we're talking about a small number

645
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,520
of passengers

646
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,120
um and ultimately it's probably

647
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,840
it's not going to go much further

648
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,158
because just the weight of the battery

649
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,240
will limit the range and the size of

650
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,200
these battery powered planes

651
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,799
so i mean in norway the situation is a

652
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,640
bit special because they have some

653
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,520
cities in the north that are relatively

654
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,799
small

655
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,360
and they are not connected to railway so

656
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,799
these small airplanes are relatively

657
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,520
important there

658
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,400
but this is more of a niche thing which

659
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,679
will play a part

660
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,400
may play a part in some areas but will

661
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,559
not

662
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,799
have a big impact on the sector as a

663
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,799
whole

664
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,120
another option for aviation is again

665
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,960
hydrogen

666
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:21,120
so recently airbus announced

667
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,720
specific plans that they want to build

668
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,479
planes

669
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,960
drawn by hydrogen they help to to

670
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,159
achieve

671
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,960
up to 3 000 kilometers which is

672
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,600
i mean it it's more than these norwegian

673
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,600
plants

674
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,039
but it's still relatively limited so

675
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,080
this is something

676
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:42,799
that could run aviation within europe

677
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:46,480
or within the united states but it's not

678
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,480
enough for a transatlantic flight

679
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,799
there's uh there's essentially two ways

680
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,199
to

681
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,960
use hydrogen in an airplane one is to

682
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,120
have a fuel cell which

683
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,200
turns hydrogen into electricity and then

684
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,039
you basically have an electric plane

685
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,200
but you generate the electricity from

686
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,120
hydrogen or the other one is just to

687
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,039
have a gas turbine and directly use the

688
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,799
hydrogen within the turbine

689
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,799
and you can also combine these two

690
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,158
so what does it mean if we have hydrogen

691
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,720
powered plane

692
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:22,240
ideally with green hydrogen obviously

693
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,240
what does it mean for the climate

694
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,760
so if you burn hydrogen or if you use it

695
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:32,640
in a pure cell

696
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,640
you get water so

697
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,200
apparently it is that hydrogen plates

698
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,080
will actually

699
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,240
increase these water vapor emissions the

700
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,720
estimate by this clean sky research

701
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,720
project

702
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,720
is that this will increase the emissions

703
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,919
by 150 percent

704
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,000
and as as i said earlier we really have

705
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,600
no idea how big the climate effects of

706
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,640
these water emissions are

707
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,959
so there's a huge uncertainty here in

708
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,440
which direction this is going

709
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,360
it it might be possible to think about

710
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,799
storing that water particularly this

711
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,918
might be possible if you use a fuel cell

712
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:12,158
but that is very speculative and i mean

713
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,840
all of this is is of course speculation

714
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,600
because we're talking about technology

715
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,000
that doesn't exist today

716
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,439
that's very far from realization but

717
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,279
this is an option

718
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,919
that should be kept in mind maybe this

719
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,919
is possible

720
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,439
um then the other option that is

721
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,040
discussed for airplanes

722
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,600
are so-called e-fuels

723
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,080
[Music]

724
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,439
and the idea here is that okay we can

725
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,720
use electricity

726
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,480
and hydrogen and carbon dioxide which we

727
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,919
can get from the air i mean it takes

728
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,600
energy but

729
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:50,799
hydro carbon dioxide is everywhere

730
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:54,000
and turn that into hydrocarbons which

731
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:57,120
is the main component of oil and

732
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,399
other fuels so

733
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,840
the advantage of this is that we get

734
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,039
something that is almost

735
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,158
like current fuel for planes it's almost

736
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,039
like kerosene

737
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,120
so this doesn't require a lot of changes

738
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,559
to the plane we can use the technology

739
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,520
that we have today

740
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:18,320
and just replace the fuel and get a fuel

741
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,440
that is made from electricity

742
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,158
but the big disadvantage about this

743
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:28,000
is that this is extremely inefficient

744
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,000
and it needs a lot of electricity

745
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,279
and just how much this clean sky

746
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,880
research project i already mentioned

747
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,720
they have calculated a number of

748
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,799
scenarios for a future

749
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,720
aviation industry with a combination of

750
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,720
hydrogen and e-fuels

751
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,399
and they looked like a scenario what

752
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:49,760
what could happen in the year 2050

753
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,320
and if they look at this with e-fuels

754
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,440
alone

755
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,158
you end up with 32 petabot hours per

756
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,000
year

757
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,000
which is more than the current world

758
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,320
electricity production

759
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,559
and they looked at two scenarios with a

760
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,480
combination of hydrogen and e-fuels one

761
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,399
with a higher share of hydrogen and one

762
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,159
with the lower shear depending on

763
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,840
how fast you could roll out this

764
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,080
hydrogen technology

765
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,000
and they end up there with one scenario

766
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,199
with 21 petawatt hours or

767
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,240
28 percent hours

768
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,720
so uh this is all

769
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,559
within roughly the range of what

770
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,760
currently the world electricity

771
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:30,080
production is

772
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:32,960
so this is really uh like

773
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,720
it seems extremely challenging to have

774
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,799
the idea that we would have to

775
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,480
have all the electricity production that

776
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,879
is used today

777
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,290
clean that up and just use that for the

778
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,519
aviation industry

779
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:48,080
[Music]

780
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,640
i have to say when you look at into this

781
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,279
study

782
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,559
what their assumptions were then they

783
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,799
assumed that

784
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,559
the aviation industry would continue to

785
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,879
grow at a rapid rate

786
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,840
so they assumed a four percent growth

787
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,519
per year

788
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,000
which is less than the growth of

789
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,480
aviation in the past but it still

790
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,399
this would essentially mean that in 2050

791
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,159
you would have an aviation industry

792
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,678
that is more than three times as large

793
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,159
as it is today

794
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,720
so it would they are assuming just a

795
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,960
massive

796
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,760
increase of flights many more flights in

797
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,880
much

798
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,879
larger aviation industry and

799
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,039
i guess it's probably worth discussing

800
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,519
whether that's really such a good idea

801
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,440
or whether there are other options here

802
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,000
whether we should really talk about

803
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,960
limiting that and talk about a smaller

804
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,960
aviation industry

805
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,960
yeah um yeah another factor that we need

806
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,679
to

807
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,640
consider is chemicals and things like

808
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,640
plastic production

809
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,840
because i mean almost all the products

810
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,159
we use today they contain

811
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,320
plastics or they contain other chemicals

812
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,880
they are usually made from either oil or

813
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:00,158
from natural gas

814
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,159
and with these chemicals with these

815
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,000
chemicals from fossil fuels

816
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,039
we need to consider two forms of

817
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,840
emissions one is the emission

818
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,200
before we use that product in production

819
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,760
and they are for example

820
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,840
emissions during the the drilling of oil

821
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,799
and gas

822
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,639
their emissions in the refinery process

823
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,240
and then also there are emissions after

824
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,240
using these products if you have

825
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,320
something that's made out of plastic

826
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,720
it may end up in a landfill or it may

827
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,879
end up burned in a waste incinerator

828
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,120
in both cases that leads to further

829
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,880
emissions

830
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,840
or there are also things like for

831
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,000
example a lot of these chemicals are

832
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,760
fertilizers

833
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,279
and the fertilizers when they are

834
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,519
brought out they they emit

835
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:45,440
actually nitrous oxide which itself is a

836
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:50,159
very active greenhouse gas

837
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,159
and which is also very hard to avoid um

838
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,919
so uh the solution that is usually

839
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:58,080
proposed for the chemical sector is

840
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,039
a range of technologies that are summed

841
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,158
up under this

842
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,320
this term power to x and

843
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,000
the idea here is it's very similar to

844
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,960
the e-fuse that we talked about

845
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,480
earlier is that you take co2 that you

846
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,320
take that out of the air

847
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,000
then you take hydrogen that you can make

848
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,399
from electrolysis

849
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,159
and from that you can go on and create

850
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:21,118
all kinds of chemicals

851
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:23,440
that we need um there has been a talk

852
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:27,119
that i would recommend watching that was

853
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,240
on the uh camp last year and i've put a

854
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,240
link here and

855
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,598
you can get the slides later so if

856
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:35,839
you're interested to look into this in

857
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,839
detail there is there was this talk

858
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:41,280
there there has been a study where

859
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,119
they tried to calculate what it would

860
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,760
mean if we would have a

861
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,599
a chemical industry that is using carbon

862
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,079
capture and use technology which is

863
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,359
basically

864
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,320
that what i said we take co2 out of the

865
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,560
air and then

866
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,879
we combine it with hydrogen and turn it

867
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,040
into chemicals

868
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,359
and they calculated a scenario for the

869
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,520
year 2030

870
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,119
so this has had a little bit of growth

871
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,160
so it was a bit more

872
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,320
chemicals than used today but it was not

873
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,078
not these crazy growth projections like

874
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:17,200
the aviation example we had earlier

875
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,000
um and they ended up with two scenarios

876
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,399
one was

877
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,400
uh with technologies that are mostly

878
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,839
already available today

879
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,000
uh and the other was with more

880
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,599
speculative technologies so technologies

881
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,520
where they said this this will be

882
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,359
possible in the future but we don't have

883
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,320
this developed yet

884
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,240
and they end up with this with an

885
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,800
estimate that we would need electricity

886
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,839
between

887
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:43,200
18 and 32 petawatt hours per year

888
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:45,279
which is again roughly in the range of

889
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,720
one time the the world electricity

890
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,960
production today

891
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,399
which we would need to have this

892
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,440
chemical sector

893
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,440
uh with the uh made from electricity

894
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,119
yeah so another factor that is

895
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,839
considered as very challenging to

896
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,320
decarbonize is the production of

897
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,320
cement

898
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:14,240
so cement this also similar to the steel

899
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:17,759
issue we have a a chemical

900
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,919
source of emissions and that is that

901
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,839
cement what what is done there is that

902
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,119
you take a

903
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:26,900
calcium carbonate which is calcium

904
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,240
carbon and oxygen

905
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:31,359
[Music]

906
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,399
and you turn that into calcium oxide and

907
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:36,000
you also get

908
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,000
carbon dioxide in this process

909
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,359
and these cement emissions these

910
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,960
chemical cement emissions

911
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,279
this is around five percent of the

912
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,280
worldwide carbon dioxide emissions

913
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,880
uh the overall cement emissions are even

914
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,920
higher because there's

915
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,320
also energy emissions um but there's

916
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,960
also

917
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,200
kind of a bit of a nit that some of

918
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,200
these emissions are actually reabsorbed

919
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,000
over the lifetime of the cement but that

920
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,799
is

921
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,160
um but it's it still ends up that that

922
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,240
cement is a huge

923
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:11,520
source of carbon dioxide emissions

924
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,240
and there's really not no technology

925
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,079
that has a perspective of bringing down

926
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,399
these cement emissions to zero

927
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,400
or even close to that so

928
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:27,118
the only option that is that that is

929
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,280
available here is really to actually

930
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,480
capture these carbon dioxide emissions

931
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,960
and to store them underground

932
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,160
and this is a technology that is known

933
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,400
as ccs or

934
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:43,598
carbon capture and storage and

935
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,160
um yeah it just just recently like uh

936
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,000
two weeks ago the company heidelberg

937
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,960
cement they announced that they

938
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,560
want to build such a ccs facility at a

939
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,960
cement plant in

940
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,480
norway although they for at the

941
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,359
beginning they only plan with

942
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,880
a 50 capture rate and the reason for

943
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,960
that is actually that they

944
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,119
they will use heat for this ccs process

945
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,880
and they want to use waste teeth from

946
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,359
their cement plant and

947
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,200
they don't have enough heat to get to a

948
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,960
higher capture rate but it would be

949
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,359
possible to go to much higher capture

950
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,359
rates

951
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,359
so ccs has been proposed as a climate

952
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,280
solution for many years

953
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,720
but it has not been very successful

954
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,000
until now

955
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,399
um and also and this is

956
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,160
uh like a bit of the problem here ccs

957
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,480
has often been used as kind of an

958
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,279
excuse for example we had this in

959
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,280
germany

960
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,040
like when the last wave of new coal

961
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,800
power plants was built

962
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,079
then you often had this argument where

963
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,400
people said yeah

964
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,079
but these these emissions from coal they

965
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,680
are not really a problem because we have

966
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,440
the ccs technology

967
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,680
which at some point in the future we

968
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,839
will add to these power plants

969
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,799
which was never really very plausible

970
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,839
but this was

971
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,960
the discussion that we had

972
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:02,160
um and uh also like if you look at the

973
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,800
existing ccs

974
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,920
projects today most of them are actually

975
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,400
doing something

976
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,520
that is called enhanced oil recovery

977
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,000
which means

978
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,759
you're taking the co2 you're pumping it

979
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,920
into an old oil field

980
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,599
and that allows you to squeeze out a

981
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,560
little bit more of oil from these oil

982
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,839
fills

983
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,078
which i mean at first obviously

984
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,799
that is not very good for the climate

985
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,200
because it needs more oil production

986
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,720
but also there's there there are a lot

987
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,279
of concerns like in the u.s

988
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,680
there's some oil companies get some

989
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,119
subsidy if they actually do this

990
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,598
uh because they're doing something for

991
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,320
the climate right but it's not very well

992
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,200
monitored

993
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,920
and there have been cases where this co2

994
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,799
was leaking out of old oil wells

995
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,320
um and yeah this whole thing is very

996
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,560
problematic

997
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,160
um so so yeah ccs overall

998
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,400
is very controversial and it is

999
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,160
problematic but for cement

1000
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,240
there really isn't much of an

1001
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:06,319
alternative and

1002
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,479
so it is probably a direction

1003
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,880
it's something that needs to be done in

1004
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,400
this sector

1005
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,800
um yeah i just want to briefly mention

1006
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,640
uh that there are a lot of other sectors

1007
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,880
that are also very challenging that i

1008
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,680
won't go into detail one of them is

1009
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,480
like all of agriculture and particularly

1010
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,480
meat production

1011
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:33,040
then there is shipping which is

1012
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,960
mostly based on fossil fuels one

1013
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,759
promising option there may be to use

1014
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,839
ammonia created from electricity

1015
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,520
then there's also of course trucks and

1016
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:45,440
street transport

1017
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:47,520
um there it seems also electrification

1018
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,640
with batteries may play a big role in

1019
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,079
the future

1020
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,078
and then there's the whole topic of

1021
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,800
heating and that is like both

1022
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,880
heating of in the domestic sector but

1023
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,800
also in industry where you have

1024
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,079
industrial processes that need a lot of

1025
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,200
heat

1026
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:07,359
um yeah so

1027
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:11,919
yeah um and then there's another

1028
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:15,200
big topic and that is negative emissions

1029
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:18,319
so a lot of the

1030
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,439
climate scenarios that the ipcc has

1031
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,279
calculated

1032
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,599
they assume that at some point in the

1033
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,359
future we will not just stop

1034
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,880
emitting carbon dioxide but they also

1035
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,520
assume that we will

1036
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,520
suck emissions out of the atmosphere

1037
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,400
just because we have already emitted so

1038
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,480
much co2

1039
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,400
that in order to to get to a safe

1040
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,720
climate we we just need to

1041
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,119
reverse that process and get these

1042
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,160
emissions back

1043
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,200
um and i mean one option to do this is

1044
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,319
renaturation

1045
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,879
if you plant a tree it it binds

1046
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,480
carbon dioxide but this has limits i

1047
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,520
mean there's there's just not enough

1048
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,200
space to do this

1049
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,520
at a large scale so

1050
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,879
uh one technology the one possibility

1051
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,560
that's discussed there is to use

1052
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,000
something called direct air capture

1053
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,960
which

1054
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,160
basically just means we take the co2 out

1055
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,480
of the air

1056
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,560
and then we use ccs so then we store it

1057
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,560
underground

1058
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,640
um yeah um and

1059
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,240
there was a study published in nature

1060
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,359
communications that tried to

1061
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:26,879
calculate the the energy needs for that

1062
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:28,720
because um the this would be huge and

1063
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,400
they ended up like with some of these

1064
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,200
scenarios you'll end up with something

1065
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,240
like

1066
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:39,359
83 petabyte hours per year in the year

1067
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:42,078
2100 and that is

1068
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:44,160
around three times the electricity

1069
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:47,920
production of the world today

1070
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,480
so it's really hard to to contemplate

1071
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,680
that

1072
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,200
this would actually be possible and even

1073
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,960
more so if you think about what what

1074
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,720
should the economics behind this be

1075
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,400
because there's not really an incentive

1076
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,000
for someone to build these

1077
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,680
air capture machines it would be

1078
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,079
something you do

1079
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,598
for for the world climate but not you

1080
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,200
wouldn't have a

1081
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:13,680
personal incentive to actually do that

1082
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:17,118
yeah yeah so some conclusions from this

1083
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:20,799
so i mean i guess it's very obvious

1084
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,720
that this is all extremely challenging

1085
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,240
like in something there are no good

1086
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,200
options in many sectors

1087
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,000
and it takes sometimes insane amounts of

1088
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,399
energy to actually do this

1089
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,040
and many of these technologies are in

1090
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,480
very very early stages

1091
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:41,040
um and i i guess this is

1092
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,839
the biggest takeaway that this just

1093
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,720
requires

1094
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:46,400
massive amounts of electricity like we

1095
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,319
just need to contemplate that

1096
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,000
if we want to go that path we need

1097
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:52,960
multiple times the electricity

1098
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,960
production today

1099
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,960
and uh just a few thoughts how how i

1100
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,440
think we should

1101
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,720
think about that i mean first of all

1102
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,520
yeah we need to build

1103
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,040
lots and lots of wind and solar energy

1104
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,920
and we should really think about

1105
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,440
think big about this like something like

1106
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,680
this is currently

1107
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,040
one of the biggest solar installations

1108
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,560
in the world this is one in

1109
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,240
india so really huge amounts of solar

1110
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,078
energy in the desert i guess

1111
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,319
i mean we should build solar energy

1112
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,000
everywhere where it's feasible but

1113
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:26,000
we should really also think about these

1114
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,319
really big projects where we can have

1115
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,640
massive amounts of them

1116
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,440
and yeah the same with wind i mean this

1117
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,279
is an offshore wind farm this is um

1118
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,200
an off-road wind farm in denmark but

1119
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,599
yeah i think about

1120
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:43,118
like we we need huge amounts of this

1121
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:45,440
renewable electricity teachers

1122
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,400
um then i mean yeah developing these

1123
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,400
technologies

1124
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,720
it should have started a long time ago

1125
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,960
basically you often think like okay

1126
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,640
this is very difficult to develop and

1127
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,280
we're just starting with it and

1128
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,440
like we should have done that earlier

1129
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,040
and and it absolutely needs to start now

1130
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,240
and it needs to start now in

1131
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:07,599
all these sectors

1132
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,200
um and this is i think an important

1133
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,079
thought that

1134
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:14,000
we should not just think about uh minor

1135
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,200
improvements of existing technology

1136
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
where we maybe get

1137
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,078
10 20 improvement but we need to think

1138
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,920
about breakthrough technologies like we

1139
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,359
need to think about technologies

1140
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,400
that can really bring down these

1141
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,400
emissions to zero

1142
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,319
um and yeah cheap wind and solar is the

1143
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:33,440
one thing

1144
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,880
that is uh promising but we should think

1145
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,240
about how can we have similar

1146
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,319
developments where

1147
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,439
a technology gets massively cheaper in

1148
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,839
other areas and

1149
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,480
and one thing that i think is a very key

1150
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:46,319
technology

1151
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:49,359
is electrolysis like to produce hydrogen

1152
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:52,480
but there are other things

1153
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:53,440
um yeah and also like in some sectors

1154
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,000
the

1155
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,119
uh it already looks challenging to move

1156
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
the current demand

1157
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,880
to to electricity and to clean

1158
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,800
electricity

1159
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,960
and if we look at the growth projections

1160
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,599
it looks almost infeasible

1161
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,480
so i think particularly in in sectors

1162
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,040
that are

1163
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,599
that are extremely challenging one would

1164
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,599
be

1165
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:16,560
long distance aviation long distance

1166
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:19,359
flights another would be cement

1167
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,440
we should talk about how can we actually

1168
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:23,520
limit these sectors or even how can we

1169
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,280
shrink these sectors and not continue

1170
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,480
growing them

1171
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,880
yeah yeah that was my talk

1172
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,680
um thanks for listening i think we will

1173
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,720
have a

1174
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,720
q a session afterwards yeah thanks

1175
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:44,079
thanks a lot for the talk

1176
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:47,359
um hello can you hear me we

1177
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:51,440
hopefully now have a q a session

1178
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:54,160
um hi cool um so

1179
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,520
until now there have been no questions

1180
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,118
uh that that has

1181
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:02,160
have uh received us that we received

1182
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,880
um if you are watching to this watching

1183
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,279
the stream and

1184
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,920
still have a question please just send

1185
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,960
it to us

1186
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:12,400
under the rc3 oyo

1187
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,359
on twitter or at the irc it's all in the

1188
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,880
stream details

1189
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:20,400
on the streaming page um

1190
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:23,440
hello i i i when i

1191
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,839
watched your talk i i thought how do you

1192
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,280
cope with thinking and doing research on

1193
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:30,078
such depressing

1194
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,480
topics and not going crazy not giving up

1195
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,240
um

1196
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,040
and still having like interacting with

1197
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,598
that

1198
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,119
and and not losing hope how do you do

1199
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,319
that

1200
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:45,599
um okay uh i wonder how long this

1201
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:48,720
this should be but uh so

1202
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,960
uh i mean one thing is like i i was kind

1203
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,359
of deep into these topics about a decade

1204
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,720
ago and for several years

1205
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:57,839
i i like became interested in other

1206
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,520
topics and that all

1207
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,839
i had to do with frustration because i

1208
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:05,440
felt not much was going forward

1209
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:08,240
but i mean i really feel that

1210
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,280
we are still far from from where we

1211
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,399
should be

1212
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:15,760
but things have definitely changed so if

1213
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,760
i observe these things like for example

1214
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,520
i think i mentioned it in the talk that

1215
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,000
right now in the steel industry you can

1216
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,319
really see

1217
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,359
that this is not just talking but this

1218
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:26,720
is

1219
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:29,440
there's something happening so

1220
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,720
so i guess this is yeah this is my

1221
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,839
answer to it that

1222
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,439
i and we're still like only very much at

1223
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,640
the beginning of tackling these things

1224
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,040
seriously

1225
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,319
but it's a very different discussion

1226
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,759
from

1227
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:46,800
like several years ago okay

1228
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,640
thank you um i i i do think that these

1229
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,520
perspectives that you show

1230
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,200
or like even with practical solutions on

1231
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,680
these other sectors this is how you

1232
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,879
could

1233
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,558
decarbonize them is kind of giving hope

1234
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,559
and it's kind of like it feels like

1235
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,440
there might be a solution to all these

1236
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,559
problems

1237
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:08,000
um i thought um do you know if there's

1238
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,800
somebody calculated it through what that

1239
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,720
might cost

1240
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:14,800
so as far as i understood it you can um

1241
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,759
have the numbers of how much energy

1242
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,160
would we need

1243
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,440
to decarbonize everything and you can

1244
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,558
guess how much

1245
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,480
it maybe might cost to to install these

1246
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,119
replacement technologies

1247
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,240
and do you know if somebody calculated a

1248
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,280
number

1249
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,680
how many billions of dollars we would we

1250
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,720
need

1251
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:37,839
to invest in the next 10 20 years to

1252
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:40,959
prevent a bigger climate crisis

1253
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:44,240
backlashes so i'm not really aware of

1254
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,079
a thorough scenario that would

1255
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,759
like factoring all the things

1256
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,480
particularly like

1257
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,559
you often have where people start

1258
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,440
calculating but they only look at energy

1259
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:58,160
and don't look at

1260
00:49:53,440 --> 00:50:01,599
something like chemistry or um

1261
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,879
like i i read about a new calculation

1262
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,040
that was i think a

1263
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,720
finnish researched institute that seemed

1264
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,200
to be more

1265
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,919
more so than what i had seen before that

1266
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,520
was only a few days ago

1267
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,000
it was actually after i recorded the

1268
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,839
talk so um

1269
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,119
but that was about the energy need and

1270
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,920
not the

1271
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:23,359
not the cost of that and also like there

1272
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,559
are a lot of

1273
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:29,359
questions like do you assume that we're

1274
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:31,520
just growing the economy going forward

1275
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,799
then things get obviously harder like i

1276
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,599
imagine the the

1277
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,520
example of aviation in the talk uh they

1278
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,839
get to these huge numbers but also they

1279
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,079
assume we will just have three times as

1280
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:45,279
many planes in the future as now

1281
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:47,680
and these are obviously uh

1282
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,960
factors that you need to consider when

1283
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:54,399
you try to calculate something like that

1284
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:57,040
okay thank you yeah that makes sense um

1285
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,720
i just thought so usually in in talks

1286
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,800
like this i ask people so

1287
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,240
what what do people have to do so what's

1288
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,640
the call to action what what

1289
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,399
do we need to do i mean right now there

1290
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,680
is some sort of a

1291
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,359
climate social movement but um

1292
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,520
yeah i would imagine that there's a

1293
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:16,960
difference between these

1294
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:19,440
uh general uh what's general being

1295
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,000
generally being said in these uh social

1296
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,119
movements

1297
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,480
and these specific topics of we need to

1298
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,880
decarbonize that and

1299
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,520
in this industry that needs to change is

1300
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,680
there something

1301
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,119
for for people listening who feel like i

1302
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,240
need to do something is there something

1303
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,680
you can tell them

1304
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,598
that they specifically can tackle

1305
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,680
so so i think what what really should

1306
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,640
happen is that more people ask questions

1307
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,279
like if you have a if you have a company

1308
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,000
where you live

1309
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,119
in your city that that is i don't know

1310
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,160
maybe producing

1311
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:51,359
hydrogen then like ask your local

1312
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,118
politicians like

1313
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,720
uh this company is probably producing

1314
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,960
lots of carbon emissions and when will

1315
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:00,558
they switch to green hydrogen

1316
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,240
like um like i feel a lot of these

1317
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,680
things they don't have a lot of focus

1318
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,479
right now and for example there are

1319
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,040
still

1320
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,760
constructions of new facilities to

1321
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,800
produce

1322
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:14,240
hydrogen from fossil fuels and

1323
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,240
they are still like uh or yes currently

1324
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,879
in the uk there's a discussion about a

1325
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:22,000
new coal mine for steel production

1326
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,559
so and i think this is like like people

1327
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,079
should

1328
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,160
get more engaged about this and they

1329
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,720
think a good way is like look at

1330
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,319
maybe what's around you or maybe look at

1331
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,399
if you work somewhere of course

1332
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:34,400
like ask these questions like what is

1333
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:37,680
the plan for this company to

1334
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:42,079
get carbon free how yeah

1335
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:44,319
cool thank you so far oh there comes

1336
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,079
a question from twitter which is

1337
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:49,040
appearing right now

1338
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,160
what should a normal person do to help

1339
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,839
change slash

1340
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,319
change in their lifestyle to have the

1341
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:57,680
biggest impact

1342
00:52:54,319 --> 00:53:01,359
um okay so i'm

1343
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:03,759
i am a bit um i don't know

1344
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:05,440
i have conflicting thoughts about how

1345
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,160
much we should focus on lifestyle

1346
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,559
changes because in the end i think

1347
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,319
they can will only ever play a small

1348
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,119
role and what we really need to change

1349
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:16,000
is

1350
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,400
like we need to change the bigger things

1351
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,640
and

1352
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,000
because we're not gonna solve this by

1353
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,558
voluntary actions

1354
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,400
but i mean if you calculate these things

1355
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:27,440
these things that have a big impact

1356
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:31,119
is like avoiding to fly

1357
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:33,200
not driving a car not eating meat

1358
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:35,119
and also like living conditions like

1359
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:38,319
having a if you live in a

1360
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:40,720
in a more isolated house or if you also

1361
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:44,000
choosing to live in a smaller flat these

1362
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,839
are things that matter a lot

1363
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,240
okay thank you and that's another

1364
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:49,440
question that just came in i think via

1365
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,839
twitter

1366
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,800
um and it says what amount of energy

1367
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:56,480
could be safe

1368
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:58,319
if you if you reused co2 from eg

1369
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,119
cement production for the chemical

1370
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:02,000
sector instead of fueling the chemical

1371
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:05,280
sector from

1372
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,240
ccu um

1373
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,119
okay so repeat it or no no i understood

1374
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,319
the question

1375
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:15,760
the the the problem with that is

1376
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:17,040
that the the stuff you put into the

1377
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,839
chemical sector

1378
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,240
will at some point be emissions so if

1379
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,240
you

1380
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,000
like you produce plastics and then they

1381
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,919
go into a waste incinerator

1382
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,200
and then you have the emissions at the

1383
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,079
end of the life of the

1384
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,359
the product so if you use the the

1385
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,599
emissions from cement

1386
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:35,598
to produce chemicals then you kind of

1387
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,119
have a double use of these emissions

1388
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,880
but you're not avoiding this the

1389
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:41,920
emissions so i

1390
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,760
don't think that this is a feasible

1391
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,599
long-term solution we will really need

1392
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:49,599
both like we will need to

1393
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:52,319
to to avoid the cement emissions and we

1394
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,720
we will need to source the chemicals

1395
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:55,759
from

1396
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:58,879
from other carbon sources

1397
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:02,400
and i i mean that i don't have a number

1398
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:07,760
for the question but i think it's not

1399
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:10,640
yeah okay thanks for the question on irc

1400
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:13,359
do you see these why just promote soda

1401
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,839
and when do you see that as well

1402
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:16,558
uh yeah yeah then please just answer

1403
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:19,119
them but

1404
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,640
we have only a couple of more minutes

1405
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:23,119
left um so

1406
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,558
maybe that last quick answer and then we

1407
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:28,400
have to move on but uh please

1408
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:29,200
answer okay so uh the thing with hydro

1409
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,440
is just that

1410
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:34,480
that in many places there's not a lot of

1411
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,680
potential to build new hydro and the

1412
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,079
potential

1413
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,240
is in many places already being used so

1414
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:43,680
so it makes sense to build more hydro

1415
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:45,598
but uh the solar and wind will will be

1416
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:49,440
the biggest chunks for future

1417
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,440
new renewable energy build

1418
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:57,359
all right hello thanks a lot for being

1419
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,880
