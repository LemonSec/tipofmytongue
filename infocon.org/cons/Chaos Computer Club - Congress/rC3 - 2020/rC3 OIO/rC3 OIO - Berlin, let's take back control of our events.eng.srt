00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,880

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,640
you realized i want to delete my

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,119
facebook account but

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,560
my facebook account is my only source to

6
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,680
get information about events

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,799

misha max misha max and joseph also

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,160
thought about that

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,079
and then they realized that the open

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,040
source mobilium events platform

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,200
mobilizin

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,040
needs to be more popular so that people

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,640
can delete their facebook account

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,440
and use mobilizin instead today they're

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,440
talking about

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,280
how that is going and how mobilizing

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,640
works and we're really glad to have you

19

next year

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,800
we are all based in berlin and we are

60
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,319
very interested in new ways of

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,760
communication

62
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,238
and technology and we ask ourselves

63
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,319
how can we take back control of our

64
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,280
events

65
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,560
i have to start one and a half years ago

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,120
when

67
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,920
i could follow mark mark is the director

68
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,560
of

69
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,518
both films nothing to hide and disappear

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,840
where we

71
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,879
wanted to find out more about massive

72
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,280
aliens

73
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,640
and on how to reduce your digital

74
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,800
footprints

75
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:04,720
i had a chance to follow mark to the ccc

76
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,280
the chaos communication camp 2019

77
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,480
we went there we met obviously a lot of

78
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,519
people

79
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,799
and at one point we talked to joseph

80
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,560
and we were we were like well there are

81
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,760
so many artists they don't know

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,159
um they are a bit forced into

83
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,480
sites like facebook and twitter or

84
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,519
instagram to just name a few

85
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,079
to post their events or to promote their

86
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,840
events

87
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,080
and that there is not really a lot of

88
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,879
different

89
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,440
possibilities to go around that so a lot

90
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,239
of

91
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,599
people stuck to facebook just because of

92
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,000
that

93
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,238
and then we got to know that there was

94
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,360
another workshop organized by reclaimed

95
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,239
club culture which

96
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,080
which we took part of and a lot of other

97
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,799
participants as well

98
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,720
and we really heard the needs of a lot

99
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,159
of people that wanted a big

100
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,280
change on that topic

101
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,239
so when we came back uh from the camp we

102
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,840
sat down with a bunch of different

103
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,239
artists

104
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,799
and programmers and we turned our head

105
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,280
around this question

106
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,400
as we heard more and more about fatty

107
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,478
verse

108
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,880
we were pretty sure that fetiverse could

109
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:22,639
be a possibility

110
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,159
um to create a self-controlled social

111
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,919
network

112
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,560
of different applications put together

113
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,919
so we got into contact with framasoft

114
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,240
primasoft is an ngo that created sites

115
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,758
like

116
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,479
peertube and mobilizer mobilizing we

117
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,680
want to talk

118
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,719
about today is a decentralized and

119
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,280
fragrated

120
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,280
free and open source event calendar and

121
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,880
could be a game changer in the near

122
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,000
future for artists

123
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:58,320
and organizers to publish their events

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,360
after a meeting that we had on um

125
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,880
on internet with the creators of

126
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,680
mobileison

127
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,639
we got interested in creating our own

128
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,280
berlin-based

129
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,440
instant to group all the events in

130
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,239
berlin and to cross post them

131
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,560
on different platforms more details on

132
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,919
that

133
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,000
of how instants work and

134
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,159
how mobilizing works joseph will give

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,840
you in a minute

136
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,000
mobilizing right now is a demo version

137
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,638
so it's really the first version

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,680
and our goal is to involve both

139
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,800
utilities

140
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,639
and the design of this page and create

141
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:42,160
new space against these big corporations

142
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,880
well so far so good now i would give the

143
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,360
word to

144
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:52,080
misha so misha what's going on

145
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,240
in berlin's underground club scene

146
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,359
hi i'm misha thank you max for the

147
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,199
introduction

148
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,880
i'm very happy to be here today and to

149
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,720
have the possibility to talk about

150
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,639
mobilizing and fadiverse as an

151
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,240
alternative to facebook and the facebook

152
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,960
event calendar

153
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,319
i am among other things an event

154
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,318
organizer myself

155
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,880
and with different collectives i already

156
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,759
hosted several club events and open airs

157
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,759
in berlin

158
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,280
and also organized and worked at

159
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,160
different festivals in europe and

160
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,520
germany

161
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,080
so i know how hard it is as an artist

162
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,639
or an event organizer to promote

163
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,719
yourself

164
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,319
or your event successfully without an

165
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,440
instance like facebook

166
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,759
and when i ask myself or my friends who

167
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,000
are also very critical towards facebook

168
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,000
but

169
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,800
on the other hand also active

170
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,240
contributors to the berlin club scene

171
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,960
or at least regular party attendees

172
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,440
why they still use facebook they always

173
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,440
sell

174
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,199
say well because i want to know what's

175
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,400
going on in berlin i want to know where

176
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,199
my friends are going

177
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,560
or they say because i need to promote

178
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,560
myself as an artist

179
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,840
or to promote the event that i'm

180
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,319
organizing

181
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,039
so basically it comes down to the

182
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,400
facebook

183
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,960
event calendar why it is that we still

184
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,080
didn't quit this platform that none of

185
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,280
us really like

186
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,880
using so it is

187
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,638
somehow schizophrenic that the berlin

188
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,479
club scene is so dependent on a platform

189
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,319
like facebook it is schizophrenic

190
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,840
because i think

191
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,240
that the club scene not only in berlin

192
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,919
but

193
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,520
also internationally has always been

194
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,560
this little utopic

195
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,758
island in a capitalistic and patriarchal

196
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,120
society

197
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:44,240
that tries to create a safe space

198
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,960
for all the people who do not fit

199
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,160
the heteronormas and heteronormative

200
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,280
stereotypes

201
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,639
of that society and of that system

202
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,039
so on parties on techno parties who

203
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,479
could

204
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,759
free ourselves anonymously and without

205
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,800
fearing the consequences outside

206
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:08,000
the club doors and most

207
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,120
people i work with they still have this

208
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,919
utopic vision

209
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,840
of a society where everybody has equal

210
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,159
rights no matter their sex or their

211
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,679
gender or their sexuality their religion

212
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,400
their skin color

213
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,479
or where they are geographically or

214
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,000
socially born into

215
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:28,080
and facebook is all of this not

216
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,800
all of this what we stand for facebook

217
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,120
is not its algorithms do not allow for

218
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,640
an

219
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:38,000
autonomous choice um facebook

220
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,799
is and i hope i don't offend anybody by

221
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,240
saying this

222
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:45,279
because i also myself still use facebook

223
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,000
but it's capitalistic is sexist

224
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,959
it allows for racism it exploits their

225
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,839
users and their users data and we still

226
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,479
depend on it in order to pay our rent

227
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,200
and

228
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,959
the rents of our clubs there was a club

229
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,279
in berlin that was always

230
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:06,839
a lot against facebook and in 2019

231
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,480
they decided to join and wrote a huge

232
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,519
statement

233
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,120
about their decision and they said

234
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:20,080
that on the one hand they needed to take

235
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:22,880
back the control of their public persona

236
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,200
because there was already facebook pages

237
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,200
of

238
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,880
that club which they did not create

239
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,200
themselves and they didn't know

240
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,240
who did it so they wanted to take back

241
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,560
this control

242
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,720
and other collectives and event

243
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,479
organizers who were also hosting events

244
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,680
at that club said

245
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,399
look without facebook and this event

246
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,560
calendar

247
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,440
we cannot promote our events

248
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,599
successfully

249
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,720
so they did a little analysis and it was

250
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,959
true

251
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,040
the events that were promoted over

252
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,359
facebook and the facebook event calendar

253
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,120
had

254
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,600
a lot more paying attendees than those

255
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,600
who were promoted without facebook

256
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,040
and with rising rents and running

257
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,920
expenses in berlin

258
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,680
the club was forced to join the game

259
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,839
that they did not want to play

260
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,079
in order to be able to pay their rent

261
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,040
they just could not afford it

262
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:15,439
not to be on facebook anymore so now

263
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,920
this is basically why we are here

264
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,959
because we want to present an

265
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,079
alternative

266
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,880
to a scene that has huge

267
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,359
international attention so maybe we can

268
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,800
here

269
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,839
even gather a critical mass that makes

270
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,399
it possible

271
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,040
to establish an alternative to facebook

272
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,320
and this is

273
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:39,439
mobilizing and free open source

274
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,399
independent and decentralized software

275
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,560
and now i would uh yeah like to give

276
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,519
back to joseph because he can now talk a

277
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,680
little bit more

278
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,079
about how this exactly works thank you

279
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,079
very much

280
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,600
so thank you max and thank you misha so

281
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,880
i'm going to talk a little bit more

282
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,600
about mobilizon

283
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,000
and the activity pub protocol both of

284
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,160
which

285
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,279
are in the spirit of the reclaimed club

286
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,839
culture movement

287
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,640
which is calling for more non-commercial

288
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,279
autonomous

289
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,279
free spaces in the berlin club scene

290
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,000
so as misha mentioned many people are

291
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,760
still using facebook for the events even

292
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,839
though they don't agree with facebook

293
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,160
as a service and this is because they

294
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:26,720
have no choice facebook is a closed

295
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,120
system either in it or you're out

296
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,200
facebook is proprietary meaning that the

297
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,800
service decides how the users use the

298
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,480
service

299
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,880
and the users have no no options

300
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,560
it's a centralized system meaning that

301
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,279
facebook controls

302
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,599
everything about it including the data

303
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,959
and

304
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,800
all of the ways that they can use and

305
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,800
abuse their users data

306
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,600
it's not just privacy issues it's also

307
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,320
their policies when it comes to which

308
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,680
content

309
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:03,040
is permitted on the service

310
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,680
so facebook is a us-based corporation

311
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,079
with

312
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,359
its own culturally specific ideas of

313
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,359
what's acceptable

314
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,800
and what's family friendly so for

315
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,040
example

316
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,000
moderators are told to allow racist

317
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,439
statements

318
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,560
things like the u.s should be a white

319
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,519
only nation however showing a nipple

320
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,399
or advertising female sexual sexual

321
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,399
well-being

322
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,399
is problematic while erectile

323
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,920
dysfunction ads are okay

324
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,920
these are not berlin values

325
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,599
mobile is on by contrast it's free

326
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,239
software

327
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,519
it's developed by fromasoft a french

328
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,040
non-profit

329
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,079
and it's released with a free software

330
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,719
license the agpl

331
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,439
free doesn't refer to the cost it refers

332
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,240
to the four

333
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,760
freedoms granted by the license that's

334
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,760
the freedoms to use

335
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:01,040
study share and improve the software

336
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,680
in short free software users control the

337
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,519
software

338
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,399
in comparison to proprietary software

339
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,800
where the software controls the users

340
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,800
and free software is how we can make

341
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,560
autonomous free spaces

342
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,560
possible in the digital world

343
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,320
moreover mobilizon is decentralized and

344
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,399
federated

345
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,000
in comparison to facebook which is a

346
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,000
centralized service

347
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,360
where facebook controls the entire

348
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,360
system

349
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,760
it decides what the terms of service are

350
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:39,040
it decides how the data is used

351
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,519
mobilizon is a

352
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,240
user's choice there are a number of

353
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,920
servers

354
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,839
that can be part of the network and

355
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,639
users can choose which server

356
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,600
has the terms of service they agree with

357
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,360
they can decide

358
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,199
the users of that server can decide

359
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,120
which instances they want to federate

360
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,040
with

361
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,360
mobilizon can do this because it's based

362
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,519
on the activity pub protocol

363
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,800
which is an open decentralized social

364
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,040
networking protocol

365
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,599
for client server and federated server

366
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,439
to server communication

367
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,800
each of the servers is independent in

368
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,320
the network

369
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,560
that means each can have their own

370
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,680
communities their own interests

371
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,959
and their own rules activity pub is a

372
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,719
standard of the world wide web

373
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,800
consortium

374
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,839
and you can think of it as a a common

375
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,760
language describing social networks

376
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,680
so that there's a shared vocabulary

377
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,920
across services

378
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,680
and there are already many services

379
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,959
using the activity

380
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,599
protocol you have mastodon

381
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,199
which is a twitter alternative peertube

382
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,519
a youtube alternative

383
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,800
next cloud a dropbox alternative

384
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,199
pixelfed

385
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,639
and instagram alternative all making up

386
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:52,399
what's called the fetaverse

387
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,160
a portmanteau of federation and universe

388
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,839
the fetaverse is an ensemble of

389
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,360
federated services

390
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,120
all of which can communicate with each

391
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,880
other

392
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,240
which means that if you're using one

393
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,160
service

394
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,320
such as mastodon you can publish posts

395
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,680
shares and likes with any other service

396
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,600
that are part of the

397
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,519
fetiverse services

398
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,120
since mastodon and mobilized on speak

399
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,839
the same language

400
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,480
a mastodon follow uh user which is like

401
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,839
twitter

402
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,040
can follow events on mobilize on

403
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,360
even if they don't have an account with

404
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,959
mobilezone they can comment on the

405
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,320
events in mobile is on

406
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,000
again even if they don't have an account

407
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,000
with mobile as on

408
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,240
this would be like a twitter user

409
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,519
following facebook events

410
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,399
even without a facebook account this

411
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,759
enables autonomy

412
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,800
self-determination and user choice

413
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,480
across a giant

414
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,199
social network with no walled gardens

415
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:55,839
in this way the content is separate from

416
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,839
the platforms

417
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,040
as max already mentioned mobile is on is

418
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,599
still in development the first version

419
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,519
was released in october

420
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,199
there are other event management

421
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,600
software

422
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,399
services that are looking to implement

423
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,040
activity pub

424
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,720
for example get together but at the

425
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,920
moment as far as we know mobilizing is

426
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,680
the only one that's

427
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,759
done this if you want to take

428
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,279
a test run of mobilizon without

429
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,600
committing to it you can go to their

430
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,120
demo

431
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,399
demo.mobilizon.org

432
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,560
all the data is deleted after 24 hours

433
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,399
you can set up a profile set your user

434
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,719
settings you can take a look at how the

435
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,519
federated identity works

436
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,120
it looks a lot like an email address you

437
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,720
can explore find out for example that

438
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:51,839
there's a talk today

439
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,839
about mobile is on at the ccc

440
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,720
the main reason that we're here today is

441
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,279
because we want to rally berliners

442
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,399
to start using mobile is on and to to

443
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,519
encourage that

444
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:06,559
uh max misha and some other people

445
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,359
are setting up a server in berlin for

446
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,799
berlin

447
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,879
for berlin clubs in the berlin scene

448
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,199
to do this we have a volunteer systems

449
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,199
administrator to maintain the server

450
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,280
we have a programmer that's working on

451
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,880
posting so that if an event appears in

452
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,160
facebook it also appears and mobile is

453
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,679
on

454
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,760
we have a volunteer organizer to found

455
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,880
an association collect donations to

456
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,440
maintain the server

457
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,039
over a longer period of time and we have

458
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,760
a couple of interested club and event

459
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,600
organizers and several users

460
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,440
what we want and what we need we need

461
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,760
more event organizers

462
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,200
and most importantly we need more users

463
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,919
we need a critical mass

464
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,600
to break out of the vicious cycle that

465
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,200
users won't use it until their events

466
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,240
but event managers won't use

467
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,720
the service until there are users

468
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,840
this network effect can only be broken

469
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,440
if enough people start using it

470
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,120
we're looking for contributors to help

471
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,440
write a mobilize on berlin

472
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:05,520
terms of service we want this to be an

473
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,200
instance that reflects berlin values

474
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,879
we're looking for designers to help

475
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,840
design a user interface

476
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,360
with a berlin flavor it's free software

477
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,639
so we can control the server we can

478
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,320
contribute back to the project

479
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,799
and eventually we want to see more

480
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:29,840
mobilizing instances both in berlin

481
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:29,840
and around the world

482
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,320

498
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,000
this is all small steps so

499
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,799
it can take a while for people to know

500
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,919
about this

501
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:21,200
and to move over to mobilizing

502
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,400
and get this thing going well we thank

503
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,440

504
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,080

already

508
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,720
thanks a lot for the talk we have some

509
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,440
questions

510
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,240
um the first question is a hint and a

511
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,120
question

512
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,160
somebody's um suggesting suggesting to

513
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,600
link mobilizer

514
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,760
to basket up basket.de

515
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,039
which apparently is a berlin german

516
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,520
event site

517
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,919
is that possible are there any plans to

518
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,360
link it up to other sites or is it only

519
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:05,039
possible to link it up within

520
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,959
a federated federalist network

521
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,640
the website if they're using the

522
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,440
activity pub protocol it's certainly

523
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,520
possible to

524
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,360
federate with them and i would be very

525
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,918
interested to contact them and see if

526
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,039
there's

527
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,880
any ways that there could be some

528
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,480
collaboration i mean it seems like this

529
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,440
is very much in in the spirit of what

530
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,760
we're trying to do

531
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,520
so yes okay dear people asking that just

532
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,000
write him an email and he will

533
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,440
just get in contact next question are

534
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,200
there plans to grow

535
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,520
or groups in a club event context

536
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,039
in other cities in germany already

537
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,200
interested in establishing

538
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:42,320
slash using mobilizat mobile liaison

539
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,600
in munich well as we said

540
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:49,039
we try first to to do this instant uh

541
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,559
in berlin but it's more like to show

542
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,000
other people that it's possible

543
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,960
and that we hope that other cities

544
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,840
will follow the berlin instance and can

545
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,760
contact us on

546
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,240
how it works and how they should do it

547
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,720
and mobilizing in such um

548
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,440
you can go wherever you are you can

549
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,960
visit it

550
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,600
and you can check events from other

551
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,720
cities but uh this instant is really

552
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,320
then based on

553
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,840
on these billion events that we are

554
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,240
trying to to

555
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,000
um to get people together here for these

556
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,280
events

557
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,480
okay thank you contact us because

558
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,320
certainly they can learn from our

559
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,919
mistakes um if

560
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,600
if they decide to do something similar

561
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,880
in munich or perhaps there's ways that

562
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,080
there could be some collaboration i'm

563
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,559
sure there's overlapping

564
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,600
interests and ways that we could work

565
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,559
together

566
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,520
okay so you also just write him an email

567
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,158
um then as

568
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,158
a third question in a federated network

569
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,039
who would be responsible for moderating

570
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,360
hate speech or illegal content

571
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,960
yes so this would be up to the instances

572
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,439
themselves so each

573
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,039
server can decide with which other

574
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,720
servers they want to federate with

575
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,720
and there actually is some precedence

576
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,679
for this there was in 2014

577
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,200
with the diaspora network which is using

578
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,480
not the activity pub protocol but the

579
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,600
diaspora protocol

580
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:10,080
but it's a similar federation of servers

581
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:12,080
and there was a problem where isis

582
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,840
was spreading propaganda after they were

583
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,199
kicked off other social networks

584
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,199
in the diaspora network and the

585
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,559
server administrators the systems

586
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,720
administrators

587
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,678
effectively cut them out of the larger

588
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,840
federation

589
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,280
marginalizing them you can't stop them

590
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,720
from setting up their own servers

591
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,639
of course but you can stop them from

592
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,240
them communicating with the

593
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,720
larger network but that's going to

594
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,480
depend on the systems administrators

595
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,799
or the people running the the various

596
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,760
instances but this is i mean this is

597
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,559
something that

598
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,360
i would say is a a feature of this

599
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,039
federation

600
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,120
that you're not letting twitter or

601
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,000
facebook decide what is okay and what's

602
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
not okay

603
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,520
there are a lot of things that twitter

604
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,520
allows that i would say if i were

605
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,360
running twitter i would not allow

606
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,960
and this kind of federated network

607
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,479
actually gives that possibility

608
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,679
to decide that cool i think that grant

609
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,720
sounds really good and

610
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:07,039
maybe it's the first starting point for

611
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,000
replacing facebook that's so in all the

612
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,480
world

613
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,320
um we're a bit over the time so i think

614
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,559
we're going to stop it here now as

615
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,200
always there's the discussion room at

616
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:19,360
discussion.rc3.org.social where you're

617
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,200
welcome to join and then you can talk to

618
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,639
them and have more follow-up questions

619
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,640
and maybe

620
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,640
oh there's another question that just

621
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,720
came in is there an api

622
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:34,559
to send events on mobilize on instance

623
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,200
from another platform uh yes as far as i

624
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,960
know yes

625
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,120
but that's you can look there's the

626
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,080
mobile zone the activity pub protocol

627
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,840
which would be

628
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,360
what would be relevant here would be you

629
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,959
can go to the the worldwide web

630
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,080
consortium and they have a full

631
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,520
um explanation of the details behind the

632
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,199
protocol

633
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,960
okay so maybe that's something for the

634
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,880
discussion room um

635
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,480
just go there if you have any other

636
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,159
questions uh we will

637
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,640
proceed shortly with another talk on

638
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,559
open source thanks a lot guys for

639
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,840
having this talk and thank you today

640
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,840
thank you

641
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:23,520
