1
00:00:40,405 --> 00:02:01,370
*electronic music*

2
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:12,549
*applause*

3
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,459
Herald: Welcome to 32c3!

4
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:21,029
Unfortunately this is the last time
I am gonna say this

5
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:22,950
I feel honored to present you

6
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:28,989
Carina and Linus with the closing event.

7
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:44,069
Linus: To be fair,

8
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:50,930
nobody wants to do the closing event.

9
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,299
You want to start?

10
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:57,319
Carina: Especially not us.

11
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:02,519
L: So, we want to recapitulate on some of
the ideas

12
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,799
that we had for this event.

13
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:13,129
And the first question I would like to ask
is:

14
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:19,370
Who of you complied with the 6-2-1 principle?

15
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,790
*laughter*

16
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,250
C: He didn't.

17
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,809
L: I didn't.

18
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:31,450
C: But it is quite some of you. I'm proud.

19
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:53,499
So, great. Your little special effects. Just
blew the show.

20
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:58,439
Not much sleep.

21
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,589
I think that's the main problem for the most
of us.

22
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:05,839
At least I really could use some more.

23
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:15,299
And, to one of the reasons for so little sleep,

24
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:16,728
which we all got,

25
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:20,978
is that some of you really

26
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:26,070
appreciated our new concept for the bathrooms

27
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,710
and saw the possibilities in that:

28
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,060
Toilet parties!

29
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:43,939
*applause*

30
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:48,150
This is something just possible,
if you don't have

31
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,979
gender based toilets.

32
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,610
*applause*

33
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:58,050
*applause*
*music*

34
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:03,629
At this toilet party they also had these
nice glowing massage sticks, I think.

35
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:10,629
It was really amazing, I hope lots of you
enjoyed there and partied there.

36
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:14,750
At least for a little while, because
it was really hot.

37
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:22,580
L: You know at C3 events, there is one rule,
that has never been changed and that is:

38
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,229
Before you take a picture,
please ask people for consent.

39
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:36,099
And for several years now, we have somebody
here that is constantly being asked for consent,

40
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:40,569
to take a picture with his camera of people.

41
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:47,753
And that is one of the little highlights
from my end of this event.

42
00:05:49,378 --> 00:05:54,100
*applause*

43
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,219
Something which happens at congresses
with this size,

44
00:05:58,219 --> 00:06:01,790
is people lose their stuff.

45
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,419
Audience: It's a person!

46
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:04,460
C: It's a person?

47
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,820
OK, that's something we didn't knew
and I think most people not,

48
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,629
because everybody was thoughting:

49
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:11,349
Who lost his shoes?

50
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:12,330
*laughter*

51
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:18,780
So, I wanna say,
if you're missing stuff

52
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,720
you still can go to the info desk, there's
a lost and found

53
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,069
you can grab you stuff there

54
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:26,519
They will be there after the closing event

55
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,770
for a little while afterwards.

56
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,639
All the stuff goes to the logistics area.

57
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,490
So perhaps your friend is also there.
Some people brought him there.

58
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,520
*laugher*

59
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,789
But as we thought shoes is not
the only thing that went missing.

60
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:44,499
There is also this.

61
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:46,200
*laugher*

62
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,159
Audience: Same person

63
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:52,059
C: Same person! Seriously?!
OK!

64
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:55,739
L: I wouldn't recognise.
I wouldn't recognise.

65
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,129
C: Yes, so if you miss something,
coming back to

66
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:04,090
the serious part,

67
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,669
go to the info desk and ask if they found
it there.

68
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:11,270
It much easier to give it back from
here than to have to ship it

69
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,790
somewhere all through the world

70
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,150
Audience:
Do they have IP packets?

71
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,789
L: They have some IP packets left, but you
must prove

72
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:21,040
that it is yours and not spoofed.

73
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:28,360
*laughter*
*applause*

74
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:35,800
You came up with a couple of challenges among
them a challenge to every CERT angel.

75
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,999
That I witnessed last night!

76
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:42,009
*laughter*

77
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:50,484
C: I think this goes without more say.

78
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,555
L: And you remember our little challenge.

79
00:07:58,328 --> 00:08:02,659
We have not prepared a price, because
we wouldn't think, that anybody would be able

80
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:04,409
to print this.

81
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:06,229
And the way it is, it was impossible.

82
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:09,639
You see the fleeting lines somewhere and I
think

83
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,620
3D printing is just not there yet.

84
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,409
But I think there is somebody in the audience
that would like to

85
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:23,073
present their attempt in 3D printing the logo.

86
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,249
*applause*

87
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:33,940
*raging applause*

88
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,120
L: Congratulations Obelix!

89
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,820
C: Congratulations!
Really nice.

90
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,950
L: I need to buy you a beer, or something.
I really didn't think,

91
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,329
that anybody would be that crazy.

92
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:03,160
*laughter*

93
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,510
It took 18 hours to print that thing.

94
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:13,060
And that was the time and effort tradeoff
to make

95
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,490
it until 7 today, so it would be here

96
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,229
for the closing ceremony.

97
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,489
C: We brought you the whole video.

98
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:26,969
*applause*

99
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:30,240
I don't know, exists there a whole video
for somebody,

100
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,380
who wants to enjoy the whole thing?

101
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,180
L: I don't know.

102
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:46,700
C: Something we also talked about
at the opening was the angels.

103
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:52,120
I heard, that when we showed you the logo
and

104
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,720
especially the URL,

105
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,430
they had a peak on their webserver.

106
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,089
Very nice.

107
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:03,960
In total we had,
can you give me the number,

108
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,490
1350 active angels

109
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:19,990
*raging applause*

110
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:25,360
These angels did more than
15000 work hours up to now

111
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:33,259
*applause*

112
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:35,580
I am really proud to say that we topped

113
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,360
the number from last year.

114
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,100
Like I wished at the opening.

115
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,480
What I learned afterwards, is that already
during the opening, we had topped

116
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,410
the number from last year.

117
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,760
applause

118
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,509
So, unluckily it was not our nice speech
which brought all of you,

119
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:06,130
but already you yourself signed up,
who signed up early. Very nice.

120
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:14,100
Yes, but, even if congress comes to an end
and this is the closing it is not over.

121
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,759
There's still a lot to clean up
in the whole house.

122
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:23,600
So, please if you go out here, help
where ever you can.

123
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,120
You don't need to be an angel for that.

124
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:32,250
Just ask where you can help, pick up stuff,
collect things, there's really much to do.

125
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:37,949
And everyone from us wants to finish early,
so that we can go to the after party tonight.

126
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:44,470
L: One little request from the clean up team
please don't just help in a way that

127
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,800
you think you're helping.

128
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,290
*laugher*

129
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:55,220
Please ask at heaven, what exactly it is,
that you could help with.

130
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:01,419
So now

131
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:03,529
We're going to do a little exercise.

132
00:12:05,136 --> 00:12:06,710
C: No, no sports!

133
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,760
L: No sports!
(laughing)

134
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,829
*applause*

135
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:20,360
We are going
to take a little mental trip.

136
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:27,240
And I want you to now be totally silent.

137
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,399
Close your eyes.

138
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,170
And lean back in your chair.

139
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,370
I still hear noise.

140
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:46,870
And now you slowly breathe in,

141
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,808
and then breathe out,

142
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,150
and again breathing in,

143
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,428
and out.

144
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,089
In front of your inner eye

145
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:07,769
you see the chaos.

146
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,130
And you release the tension
from your left leg

147
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,390
and you release the tension
from your right leg

148
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,209
and you breath in

149
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:25,690
and out.

150
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:30,930
C: Remember,

151
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,480
when you first arrived at CCH

152
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,860
and Fairy Dust was there.

153
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,040
Waiting for you.

154
00:13:39,683 --> 00:13:41,693
L: Remember,

155
00:13:41,693 --> 00:13:45,269
when you saw that talk,
you had been waiting for

156
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:47,134
all the time.

157
00:13:48,898 --> 00:13:50,620
C: Remember,

158
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,329
when you did not get into the talk,
you wanted to see

159
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:58,699
had to watch a different one.
And it was so awesome.

160
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:02,040
L: Remember,

161
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,090
when you first met someone,

162
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,989
you only knew
from the interwebz.

163
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:09,819
C: Remember,

164
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:14,379
when you had your first tasty drink
in the lounge.

165
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:17,730
L: Remember,

166
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,790
when you were getting ready to leave,
met someone and suddenly

167
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,620
the sun came up again.

168
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:29,379
C: Remember,

169
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:32,749
when you had two hours of sleep,
one meal

170
00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:34,430
and six showers.

171
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,211
*laugher*

172
00:14:39,724 --> 00:14:40,870
L: Remember,

173
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,850
when you learned something, that you thought,
that you would never understand.

174
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,970
C: Remember,

175
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,149
when you saw the joy in the eye
of a little kid,

176
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:55,856
that was soldering a robot.

177
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,529
L: Remember,

178
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:06,319
when you finally found that awesome sticker,
you had been searching for all day long.

179
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:09,889
C: Remember,

180
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:13,369
when you saw all the cool children toys
and were jealous,

181
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:16,809
because they were all used by children.

182
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:18,070
*laughter*

183
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,459
L: Remember,

184
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:26,310
that funny shirt, that one person wore.

185
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,089
C: Remember,

186
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:33,930
when you took
an involuntary nap during a lecture.

187
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:38,069
L: Remember,

188
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:42,829
all the inspiring, funny, thoughtful, and
nonsense

189
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:45,762
conversations.

190
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:50,709
and now, please, take the feeling

191
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:52,569
you have right now

192
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:54,600
and keep it in your heart

193
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,470
as an infinite source of energy.

194
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:03,319
C: And now, we want you to release this energy

195
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:07,599
to thank everybody, not only for 
their work at congress

196
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,470
but also throughout the years.

197
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,599
L: On the count of three

198
00:16:14,229 --> 00:16:20,769
let us ecstatically cheer
and applaud so loudly

199
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:26,829
that Lemmy Kilmister raises from the dead
to compain about the fucking noise.

200
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:27,949
*laughter*

201
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:31,100
C and L: one

202
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,950
two

203
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,789
three

204
00:16:34,789 --> 00:17:47,400
*raging applause*

205
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,430
*laughter*

206
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:05,722
*applause*

207
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:15,060
*electronic music*

208
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,748
Female narrator: [German]
Die Digitalisierung durchdringt unsere Gesellschaft

209
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:21,810
und die Nutzung informationstechnischer Systeme
und des Internets

210
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,110
schreiten unaufhörlich voran.

211
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,060
Das bietet neue Chancen,
schafft Freiräume

212
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,180
und ermöglicht Synergien.

213
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,920
Das Netz beeinflusst unser gesamtes
öffentliches und privates Leben.

214
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,910
Über Branchengrenzen hinweg

215
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,560
sind mehr als die Hälfte
aller Unternehmen in Deutschland

216
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,010
vom Internet abhängig.

217
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,020
Male narrator: [German]
All diese Einrichtungen oder Firmen

218
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,890
könnten gehackt werden.

219
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,780
*electronic music*

220
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,530
Male narrator: [German]
Die Gefahr von Hacking ist aktueller denn je.

221
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,733
De Maiziere: [German]
Und dann bräuchte ich mal 'ne
Krisen-Nummer von Ihnen.

222
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:55,700
Third male narrator: [German]
Ja, und warum?

223
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,122
De Maiziere: [German]
Ja, um da anzurufen.

224
00:18:57,122 --> 00:19:07,306
*electronic music*

225
00:19:07,306 --> 00:19:09,477
Fourth male narrator: [German]
Ich vertraue meinem Provider nicht.

226
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:15,413
Ich vertrau, ich vertrau dem Anbieter nicht.
Ich vertrau dem Staat nicht.
Aber ich änder' mein Verhalten nicht.

227
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:17,629
Male narrator [German] (mixed):
Das ist definitiv gefährlich.

228
00:19:17,961 --> 00:19:23,187
Ich vertrau Safe Harbor nicht.
Ich vertrau meinem Airbag nicht.

229
00:19:23,187 --> 00:19:26,030
Ich vertrau dem Chaos Computer Club nicht.

230
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,220
De Maiziere: Und ehrlich gesagt,
dass nenn ich sorglos.

231
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,520
Maassen: Wir sind ein attraktiver Arbeitgeber

232
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,370
Male Narrator: Warum?

233
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,760
Maassen: in manchen Bereichen unseres Hauses,
kann man all das machen,

234
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,360
was man schon immer machen wollte,
aber man ist straflos.

235
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,120
Zum Beispiel Telekommunikations-Ueberwachung.

236
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,480
Narrator: Herr Range hat eine Pressekonferenz
einberufen und in der hat er gesagt,

237
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:54,010
dass der Justizminister unerträglich in die
Unabhängigkeit der Justiz eingegriffen hat.

238
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:58,680
Das kann man auch übersetzen
in den Satz,

239
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,740
Bitte entlassen Sie mich in den Ruhestand,
Herr Justizminister.

240
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,840
De Maiziere: Dann bräuchte ich dann mal 'ne
Krisen-Nummer von Ihnen.

241
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,800
Male narrator: Ja und warum?

242
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,020
De Maiziere: Ja, verstehen Sie bitte,
dass ich darauf

243
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,759
keine Antwort geben möchte.

244
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:09,923
Male narrator: Warum?

245
00:20:09,923 --> 00:20:13,380
De Maiziere: Ein Teil dieser Antworten würde
die Bevölkerung verunsichern.

246
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:20,910
*electronic music*

247
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,250
De Maiziere: Lassen Sie es mich
an einem Beispiel sagen:

248
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,460
Sie können ein sicheres Auto haben,
mit Airbag

249
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,400
Sie können sich anschnallen

250
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,280
Sie können sich an die Verkehrsregeln halten,

251
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,730
wenn Sie aber trotzdem sorglos fahren,
produzieren Sie einen Unfall.

252
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,270
De Maiziere:
Und dann bräuchte ich dann mal

253
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,500
'ne Krisen-Nummer von Ihnen.

254
00:20:39,357 --> 00:20:50,124
*applause*

255
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,430
Herald: [German] Mit einem lachenden und einem
weinenden Auge sage ich

256
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,129
vielen Dank für dieses tolle Closing Event.
