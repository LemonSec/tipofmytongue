00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,465
*preroll music*

2
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:13,191
Herald: Our next speaker is Tarek Loubani.

3
00:00:13,191 --> 00:00:14,729
He is an emergency physician,

4
00:00:14,729 --> 00:00:17,840
working in the Gaza Strip and in Canada

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,548
and he is developing medical hardware devices.

6
00:00:20,548 --> 00:00:25,808
And he is going to tell us about the 
Palestinian use of free hardware and software.

7
00:00:25,808 --> 00:00:29,515
So enjoy and give a warm welcome to Tarek.

8
00:00:29,515 --> 00:00:32,524
*applause*

9
00:00:32,524 --> 00:00:39,442
Tarek: ... (missing Audio)

10
00:00:39,442 --> 00:00:44,063
Thank you to CCC for inviting me 
to give this talk

11
00:00:44,063 --> 00:00:48,428
and to you for being here tonight.

12
00:00:48,428 --> 00:00:54,241
I want to start with just some very basic information
here about myself.

13
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:58,088
If we can get the video feed up.

14
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:08,869
OK, so there we go.

15
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:14,444
If you want to get a hold of me, you can find me,
find this project on github,

16
00:01:14,444 --> 00:01:18,529
you can find our team on openmed at freenode,

17
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:21,286
or you can always get a hold of me by e-mail,

18
00:01:21,286 --> 00:01:25,910
hopefully one of the easiest e-mails
you'll ever have to remember.

19
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,523
And I'll bring that information up at the end.

20
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:33,732
I want to start then with a story:

21
00:01:33,732 --> 00:01:39,502
This is another story, because you heard so many
about refugees.

22
00:01:39,502 --> 00:01:42,406
But this story is a personal one,

23
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:44,930
because it is my story as a refugee.

24
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:51,522
And about the time, that my father reminded me
of who I was.

25
00:01:51,522 --> 00:01:55,573
He put this card in front of me, 
when I was 8 years old.

26
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:59,429
This card was literally the only thing,

27
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:05,348
that atested to my existence as a human being 
for the first 12 years of my life.

28
00:02:05,348 --> 00:02:11,752
It says: The director general affirms that
Tarek Loubani is a palestinian.

29
00:02:11,752 --> 00:02:16,781
And as proof, I have given him 
this identity card.

30
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:23,252
Not a lot to work, not a lot to own,
not a lot to do anything. That was it.

31
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:25,656
And so I sat in front of my father,

32
00:02:25,656 --> 00:02:29,606
I just got, I think it was a C
on some meaningless subject

33
00:02:29,606 --> 00:02:33,780
as an 8 year old. Who cares?

34
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,989
But he cared. He put that paper in front of me
and he said:

35
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:43,417
Son, this paper, it doesn't prove 
that you're somebody,

36
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:46,710
it proves, that you're nobody,

37
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,252
that you're nothing.

38
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:54,791
And there we were, living in Kuwait with 
a nice appartment that we had rented

39
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,230
A and a car outfront. And he said:

40
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,661
all of these things didn't belong to us and
could be taken in a moment.

41
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:06,589
He had only one caveat to this nihilism.
He said:

42
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:11,960
There is only one thing you have, one thing
that the wolfs can never take away from you.

43
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,836
One thing, that you can never be dispossessed of.

44
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:20,048
And that's what you know, 
that's the information in your head.

45
00:03:20,048 --> 00:03:24,384
That's what's up in here.

46
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:29,610
And so was thesapokalyptic warning would 
result in me and my family minus my father

47
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,725
because he was trapped in Kuwait at the time
driving through this:

48
00:03:32,725 --> 00:03:35,863
The highway of death 
as it would later be called.

49
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:40,106
With my mother crying tears for weeks
while she got us out,

50
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:45,967
her 4 children until we finally made our way 
through, I think it was 4 or 5 different countries

51
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:49,024
and into Canada.

52
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:55,506
Mine is a microcosmic lesson of the lesson,
that all Palestinian were given.

53
00:03:55,506 --> 00:04:00,941
Because all Palestinian have been dispossessed
at some point or will be.

54
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:06,013
What do you think the parents of these 
children will tell them

55
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:09,060
about who they are and what they possess?

56
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,371
What do you think is the meaning of their homes
and physical possessions?

57
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:19,507
What is it that they own or that they have?

58
00:04:19,507 --> 00:04:23,385
Their parents will tell them, 
what my parents told me:

59
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:32,369
You have nothing and you are nothing.
Only what's in here.

60
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:43,052
And so, if they are in their predatory drones
then we must be the prey.

61
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:48,252
And that means, that we'll always live in the 
third world a different life

62
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:52,262
from the life the people live in the developed 
world.

63
00:04:52,262 --> 00:05:00,060
You have to be on one of the two sides of
that predator drone of that advanced missle,

64
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:07,432
of that technology, that litigation of 
treaty.

65
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:13,869
And we had seen the light of the first world
from that those refugees camps.

66
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:19,283
We saw it. And what we wanted was not
the Playstation 4s and the iPhones

67
00:05:19,283 --> 00:05:22,763
though yes, of course. Great stuff.

68
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:25,258
What we wanted was the CT scanners

69
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:29,412
and the hospitals that were outfitted so that
you could feel like you cold go in them

70
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:33,921
and come a whole human being still 
just like you went in.

71
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:39,871
That is the wealth that we wanted. That is the
wealth that we saw and that is the wealth

72
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:42,231
that they protected.

73
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:46,716
Both metaphorically and literally

74
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:54,090
through all manner of instruments of 
neoliberalism and colonialism.

75
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,443
They do it

76
00:05:56,443 --> 00:06:04,643
because to them everything, everything 
they see, everything in the world around them

77
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:07,662
is fish.

78
00:06:07,662 --> 00:06:09,535
They can't see the world any other way.

79
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:16,285
And so they think, that if you catch a fish
I can't have that same fish.

80
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:21,386
And they don't realise, that we live in a 
different world, where not everything is fish.

81
00:06:21,386 --> 00:06:26,141
Where there is information
and that information can go anywhere,

82
00:06:26,141 --> 00:06:32,517
and be anything and it can help everybody
at the same time.

83
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,962
It's not a new concept.

84
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:41,388
It's a concept that was almost perfected
by Magritte, 85 years ago

85
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:43,743
represented here:

86
00:06:43,743 --> 00:06:46,609
That is not a pipe.

87
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:50,217
It is the information to make a pipe.

88
00:06:50,217 --> 00:06:58,975
That is not an STL. Or that is not a
reproduction, that is an STL.

89
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:06,169
Let's put some economic terms on this,
because the people, who we are working against,

90
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:10,989
the people who promote the anti commons
they put language on this stuff.

91
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:13,219
This is the main language.

92
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:18,511
We can divide it into two main axes:
excludable and rivalrous.

93
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:22,774
All items more or less fall into these categories.

94
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:29,292
And so fish falls into this category. It is a 
non-excludable, largely commodity

95
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:32,497
that is rivalrous. Indeed

96
00:07:32,497 --> 00:07:36,721
it is very hard to keep people from 
catching fish out in the harbour.

97
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:43,852
But if one person catches one fish, then
the next person can not.

98
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:51,313
Where society wants us to be by and large is right here:

99
00:07:51,313 --> 00:07:56,696
Products that are non-rivalrous but excludable.

100
00:07:56,696 --> 00:08:05,349
Think for example of an mp3. An mp3 should be this:
public good, it is not excludable,

101
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:09,273
you can't keep people from it.
It is non-rivalrous.

102
00:08:09,273 --> 00:08:15,750
You give somebody an mp3, you haven't 
taken away an mp3 from anybody else.

103
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:21,259
And yet, what is desired, is for everything
to be here:

104
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:22,974
A club good.

105
00:08:22,974 --> 00:08:25,494
You need a membership.

106
00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:30,126
Be that the country you live in or
the amount of money that you make.

107
00:08:30,126 --> 00:08:35,063
It is excludable.
Because they have excluded you.

108
00:08:35,063 --> 00:08:39,021
Not because of any inaid or inherant reason.

109
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:43,614
How can we turn things from club goods
into public goods or

110
00:08:43,614 --> 00:08:49,709
another question: how have they turned things
from public goods into club goods?

111
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:54,848
Well, here two men who've led the charge:

112
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:58,088
Birch Bayh and Bob Dole.

113
00:08:58,088 --> 00:09:03,541
They came up with this legislation, that
ended up, basically making it so, that

114
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:09,766
one thing that was available, non-excludable 
and non-rivalrous, that is

115
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:16,086
all of the information coming out of universities
and these sorts of charities and other little groups

116
00:09:16,086 --> 00:09:21,713
could now be patented. Patenting is the 
main weapon here.

117
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:27,268
That's how you turn things from usable by
everybody, available to everybody

118
00:09:27,268 --> 00:09:32,774
to usable by a few and available to few.

119
00:09:32,774 --> 00:09:38,272
Their policy was absolutely a success.

120
00:09:38,272 --> 00:09:47,820
Here you see the patents, starting from 1963
all the way to 2014. Total patents granted.

121
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,859
1980 is highlighted in blue. Everything before
that is basically since the time of a man

122
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:57,472
named Vannevar Bush,
who kind of floated the main idea,

123
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:01,008
that information should kind of be out for folks.

124
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:03,406
And as you can see, it's relatively stable.

125
00:10:03,406 --> 00:10:07,212
More or less minor deviations
more or less the same.

126
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:12,734
But from 1980 to 2014 it virtually looks exponential.

127
00:10:12,734 --> 00:10:15,617
So closer with the numbers.

128
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:24,712
1980 66 thousend patents, in 2014 326033.

129
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:31,493
And so these weapons, they've resulted in 
us not being able to take things from

130
00:10:31,493 --> 00:10:37,203
simple idea to something we can use,
but instead we are loaded,

131
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:42,834
we have to walk through these landmines.

132
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:47,572
Now, this is a story that you all already know.

133
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:49,599
Because it doesn't matter what country 
you live in.

134
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:52,858
I'm guessing that everybody here lives in
first world.

135
00:10:52,858 --> 00:10:58,509
These are issues, that innovators in the first world
must content with.

136
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:04,793
But by and large these are issues that stop
people in the first world from becoming rich.

137
00:11:04,793 --> 00:11:08,676
In the third world these are issues,
that can mean the difference between

138
00:11:08,676 --> 00:11:12,258
life and death.

139
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:21,012
*applause*

140
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:26,118
Here is an example from the late 90s
early 2000s.

141
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:32,304
Profiteering pharmaceutical companies versus
South Africa.

142
00:11:32,304 --> 00:11:37,310
South Africa was in the middle of a 
absolutely terrible crisis,

143
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,197
which arguable they have not exited
with HIV AIDS

144
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:46,280
and pharmaceutical companies using
the weapon of patents

145
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,568
were saying: ehm, sorry, we can not give you
this medication at the rate you can affort,

146
00:11:51,568 --> 00:11:58,382
we can not give this medication to everybody,
because what protects our profits?

147
00:11:58,382 --> 00:12:04,414
Now, most people aren't that crass most of the
time, there are not saying what protects our profits,

148
00:12:04,414 --> 00:12:08,215
because that's bad public relations.

149
00:12:08,215 --> 00:12:13,132
But they say: Oh, what about our research and
development funds etc etc.

150
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:17,301
Of course mostly done on the public dime.

151
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:23,531
But in the end every once in a while, we happen to
see, one of the type, who pops up, who speaks

152
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:33,402
a little bit more from the heart, as we have seen
recently.

153
00:12:33,402 --> 00:12:41,455
What my father told me initially, was what I've been
taught for all the years of my life.

154
00:12:41,455 --> 00:12:42,814
*music*

155
00:12:42,814 --> 00:12:48,956
What he told me is that either
you are one of the predators

156
00:12:48,956 --> 00:12:51,645
or one of the prey.

157
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:58,713
It is an absolutely irrefutable truth.

158
00:12:58,713 --> 00:13:03,580
It's a natural order.

159
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,729
It is absolut. God gave us this.

160
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:09,372
You have to be on one side or the other.

161
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,397
You just have to accept it.

162
00:13:13,897 --> 00:13:20,337
*music of video still playing*

163
00:14:25,214 --> 00:14:29,677
And so if you're born the caribou, 
you have to own that existence,

164
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,420
and just accept it.

165
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:43,737
Well, just before I got on my plane here.
I was at work as a doctor.

166
00:14:43,737 --> 00:14:47,529
When I went to my shift, I did not go there,

167
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:52,109
so that I would allow the natural order 
to take its course.

168
00:14:52,109 --> 00:14:57,203
I did not wake up today, so that the natural
order would take its course.

169
00:14:58,706 --> 00:15:00,313
Fuck the natural order.

170
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:03,081
And fuck the world's who are behind it.

171
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:04,829
I don't want it.

172
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:06,705
People in Palestine don't want it.

173
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,894
My patience don't want it.

174
00:15:09,348 --> 00:15:10,743
None of us want it.

175
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:14,230
So, why do we accept it?

176
00:15:17,602 --> 00:15:19,854
If we look at the world around us

177
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:27,856
what we're seeing then, is this thing, that 
we want to just throw off that natural order.

178
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:34,282
But the terms of our insurgency have to be

179
00:15:34,335 --> 00:15:36,642
careful.

180
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:40,540
You can't as the caribou look at the wolf and say:

181
00:15:40,593 --> 00:15:43,313
ehm, well, I don't really care, you know, 
fuck you and fuck your natural order

182
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,410
and I am not participating.

183
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:49,162
You have to be careful,

184
00:15:49,162 --> 00:15:52,268
because they are potent, they are dangerous.

185
00:15:52,268 --> 00:15:57,720
In this particular case the main danger
to us in the third world and developing nations

186
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,578
is treaties.

187
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:05,785
These laws are applied on us by treaty and 
you can't just opt out.

188
00:16:05,785 --> 00:16:11,285
The Palestinian economic system is shut down
by FIAT

189
00:16:11,285 --> 00:16:13,569
Medication can't arrive by FIAT.

190
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:23,123
All of these things happen, because we are too
weak.

191
00:16:23,123 --> 00:16:27,841
And so, how do you respond?

192
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:31,269
What is the tool of resistance?

193
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:33,059
We eluded to it earlier.

194
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,624
My father even told it to me as a child.

195
00:16:35,624 --> 00:16:37,047
Knowledge

196
00:16:37,047 --> 00:16:39,272
and the Commons

197
00:16:39,272 --> 00:16:43,037
That is where a better future comes from.

198
00:16:43,037 --> 00:16:45,362
And that is where our examples live.

199
00:16:45,362 --> 00:16:49,355
So let's think about the free software movement.
Let's look at some examples.

200
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:54,561
Some of you are German. 
Munich is one such example.

201
00:16:54,561 --> 00:17:01,551
Munich has shifted allmost all of their city
digital infrastructure into free and open source.

202
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:04,102
They even have their own Linux distribution.

203
00:17:04,102 --> 00:17:06,342
That's pretty amazing actually.

204
00:17:06,342 --> 00:17:11,718
There are other examples, that are some minor
cities here and there.

205
00:17:11,718 --> 00:17:13,626
There are some state wide examples.

206
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:17,264
For example, such as Kerala in India.

207
00:17:17,264 --> 00:17:22,883
The chief minister basically like the prime, the 
highest person within Kerala at the time said:

208
00:17:22,883 --> 00:17:27,575
We believe that free and open-source software
is an essential component in our drive to

209
00:17:27,575 --> 00:17:35,248
democratise information technology and bring
its benefits to all sections of society.

210
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:45,291
In additon to Kerala, Tamil Nadu has done 
something similar, also in India.

211
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:50,090
And then there are some partial ministry level
efforts, that have been happening,

212
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:55,622
for example Italy, in their ministry of, I think it is, 
defense or interior, you know, had decided

213
00:17:55,622 --> 00:17:59,858
just a small move to go from Microsoft Office
to Libre Office.

214
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:03,621
Apperently small moves, but really
meaningful to the people around us.

215
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:08,838
We'll look at this from places like
Palestine, like the Gaza Strip, where I work,

216
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:12,371
and we think, why can't we do that?

217
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:14,756
Why can't we participate in these commons?

218
00:18:14,756 --> 00:18:17,450
What is it, that we can do to contribute?

219
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,903
At the national level, there are a couple of very
potent examples.

220
00:18:20,903 --> 00:18:24,752
The two main examples, that I ran into, 
were Equador and Brazil.

221
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:30,492
Equador, if you guys were at the talk yesterday
is a very interesting and nuanced place.

222
00:18:30,492 --> 00:18:34,210
So there are some authoritarian tendencies.

223
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,018
Bethany Horne, who I believe is in our 
audiency here, I won't point her out,

224
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:43,537
is one person, who's been visited by the 
authoritarianism of the group.

225
00:18:43,537 --> 00:18:49,879
But notwithstanding, they are doing some very 
good things and one of those very good things

226
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:54,094
is free software at the national level.
That's actually quite incredible.

227
00:18:54,094 --> 00:18:57,059
Directed from the presidency.

228
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:05,671
Brazil very similar. Brazil started their move
almost the same time, maybe a little bit before.

229
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:12,970
So, Palestine looks quite ripe. For exactly the 
same thing we've been seen,

230
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,227
has a few characteristics:

231
00:19:15,227 --> 00:19:19,945
These are the literacy levels of 
a few different countries.

232
00:19:19,945 --> 00:19:23,741
United States and Germany,
basically 1% who are illiterate.

233
00:19:23,741 --> 00:19:27,966
Brazil and Equador 90.4 and 91.6

234
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:35,824
Palestine 95.3. That's the Westbank and the
Gaza Strip. My best guess, if you would include

235
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:39,212
the diaspora that number would go significantly up.

236
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:41,362
Because the diaspora tends to be well educated.

237
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:45,242
That means that this lesson 
that my father gave me is a lesson that

238
00:19:45,242 --> 00:19:50,446
clearly Palestinians have been receiving for
years if not decades.

239
00:19:50,446 --> 00:19:54,252
They're intelligent people, they're well educated.

240
00:19:54,252 --> 00:20:00,242
They're living under occupation and they want to
see a change.

241
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:03,730
So, we've started all of the same things 
that you would expect.

242
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:09,052
We started of course replacing all of our servers 
with Apache based

243
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:11,041
if any of them were ever on Windows.

244
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:16,000
We've started of course using backends for 
our contact management systems, like

245
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,918
Joomla and Drupal.

246
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:20,532
Of course, we started doing those things.

247
00:20:20,532 --> 00:20:23,956
In terms of the infrastructure that's more or less
the step where we are.

248
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:29,597
We are at infrastructural components rather
then desktops.

249
00:20:29,597 --> 00:20:34,619
We have a very nascent EMR, 
that will be coming up hopefully soon.

250
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:43,827
And we expect that this EMR will leverage at the
best of what we have and what we see.

251
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:50,224
However there is something else that's interessing
a response to the necessity we have in Palestine.

252
00:20:50,224 --> 00:20:55,833
We learned that lesson from people, decorating
their shoes, submerging their computers

253
00:20:55,833 --> 00:21:03,066
from Novenas and homemade 
chicken CT scanners.

254
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:09,215
And what we started doing is making our 
own hardware as well.

255
00:21:09,215 --> 00:21:16,448
I believe that the Gaza Strip is the first place
that is trying a national level strategy for

256
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:19,823
open source hardware and is pushing it hard.

257
00:21:19,823 --> 00:21:28,787
We saw 3D printers, we saw how they worked.
We wanted our own and we got them.

258
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:32,499
Leftmost is the very first 3D printer ever
made in Gaza.

259
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:38,025
In the middle and the next one are their children.
Made entirely in Gaza.

260
00:21:38,025 --> 00:21:42,651
Some of the electronics have to come in,
all of the motors are salvaged from garbage.

261
00:21:42,651 --> 00:21:47,404
We expect that within a year, we'll be able to
make everything domestically.

262
00:21:47,404 --> 00:21:51,478
That's our hope and that's our dream and
I think we can get there.

263
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:55,225
Of course my own work has been to make 
medical devices.

264
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:56,727
That's where I've been leveraging them.

265
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:58,605
This is a stethoscope, a very early version.

266
00:21:58,605 --> 00:22:03,217
This is the final version as of 3 weeks ago
approved by Health Canada.

267
00:22:03,217 --> 00:22:08,039
This is a first world medical device, 
that is available for pennies.

268
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:17,970
*applause*

269
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,277
2 Dollars and 50 Cents to replace 
a 300 Dollar stethoscope.

270
00:22:21,277 --> 00:22:25,321
It's not that people have 300 Dollar stethoscope
running around, I said they had nothing.

271
00:22:25,321 --> 00:22:28,136
Now they have something.

272
00:22:28,136 --> 00:22:31,055
It's been with the help of Kliment, who you will
recognise from around here and

273
00:22:31,055 --> 00:22:32,933
Jenn who you will recognise from here

274
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:39,568
and some engineers, who I can't really show,
because I fear for their safety.

275
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:43,337
Our Palestinians, the heros, 
the real heros of this work.

276
00:22:43,337 --> 00:22:49,293
And as you can see here from a frequency-audio
response curve, it's as good as anything out there.

277
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:55,178
We're working next on a pulse oximeter with the
help of really talented engineer Hanan Anis

278
00:22:55,178 --> 00:23:01,674
from University of Ottawa. And that should be 
ready by the middle of next year.

279
00:23:01,674 --> 00:23:06,229
Surgical tools will be forthcoming, because
right now in Gaza we're washing everything

280
00:23:06,229 --> 00:23:08,110
with salt water.

281
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:15,799
And prostetics are coming, we hope.
Lots of issues there, but not technical.

282
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:23,836
We have this origin story for the commons, as 
so the commons was something from the past.

283
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:26,750
That was there and then now it's gone.

284
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:30,023
But that origin story, I think, is a myth.

285
00:23:30,023 --> 00:23:34,440
And when we recognise, that the commons
are actually an evolution of where we are

286
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,125
rather than somewhere that we were before,
we trying to reclaim.

287
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:43,451
Then I think the next step is trying to
figure out, how to get back there.

288
00:23:43,451 --> 00:23:49,344
At that's what we are trying to do in Palestine.
How do we get back there?

289
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:55,625
The biggest way is to break down those borders
and blockades and share information.

290
00:23:55,625 --> 00:24:03,950
And so, I want to invite you, all of you
to come with me to Gaza

291
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:11,814
In May for the first international Free and 
Open Source Health Conference.

292
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:18,388
Where we will discuss these ideas
and where we will try to move forward

293
00:24:18,388 --> 00:24:22,623
the commons. If the anti commons
is generally funded by

294
00:24:22,623 --> 00:24:26,954
military industrial complex, as we see within
Silicon Valley and so on,

295
00:24:26,954 --> 00:24:31,972
then maybe this commons can be funded
by the ever green spending

296
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:35,514
that we always have in health care.

297
00:24:35,514 --> 00:24:40,088
Health care is one of the biggest spends
in the Gaza Strip.

298
00:24:40,088 --> 00:24:47,444
And if we direct it in the right places we can also 
use it to develop our national sovereignty.

299
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:53,090
Join me, in whatever where you can.

300
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,601
And let's make it more sovereign
better place.

301
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:59,370
For Gaza and for everywhere else.

302
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,762
Thank you.

303
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:12,117
*applause*

304
00:25:12,117 --> 00:25:18,874
Herald: Thank you for the talk.
And we have about 5 min for questions.

305
00:25:18,874 --> 00:25:27,124
So please if you have any questions line up 
in front of one of the microphones.

306
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:33,488
Please!

307
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:40,838
Question: I would like to know, how did you 
distribute your open source instruments.

308
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:47,886
Is it also possible for other countries that have
the same problems as in Palestinian areas

309
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:49,595
to get those?

310
00:25:49,595 --> 00:25:55,409
Tarek: Yes, absolutely. One thing we don't do
is give medical devices.

311
00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:59,989
Anybody who's interested, and there have been
few ministry to ministry contacts on this,

312
00:25:59,989 --> 00:26:05,219
is basically encouraged to start up their own
fundamentally fab lab.

313
00:26:05,219 --> 00:26:11,713
So, what we do is, we go into a country, talk to their
engineers, engineering departments and so on,

314
00:26:11,713 --> 00:26:17,341
and we try to get them up and running, 
so that they're manufacturing their own stuff.

315
00:26:17,341 --> 00:26:24,207
This means anybody who's tried to start an open
source project or free and open source project

316
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,735
will know that the more contributors the better.

317
00:26:26,735 --> 00:26:28,266
You don't want consumers.

318
00:26:28,266 --> 00:26:30,428
You want people, who are participating.

319
00:26:30,428 --> 00:26:35,675
And so anybody who wants to... it's under an open
source licence. The open hardware licence.

320
00:26:35,675 --> 00:26:39,800
And actually it's also cross licenced to GPLv3.

321
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:45,390
Please take it. It would be my privilege to see it 
in the news everywhere else. It really would be.

322
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:50,675
Everybody who's working on it, wants to see that.

323
00:26:55,515 --> 00:27:01,948
Herald: OK, thank you very much again and see
you at the next talk, enjoy the rest of the conference.

324
00:27:01,948 --> 00:27:06,351
Oh, wait we have a question from the internet
it seems.

325
00:27:06,351 --> 00:27:11,313
Question: What would be the solution to Palestine?

326
00:27:15,063 --> 00:27:20,411
Tarek: I don't think you need to worry about the
occupation. I think that's the question.

327
00:27:20,411 --> 00:27:23,471
Don't worry about the occupation.

328
00:27:23,471 --> 00:27:26,891
The occupation is a little bit like a marathon.

329
00:27:26,891 --> 00:27:30,696
You have to keep working, we see the end though.

330
00:27:30,696 --> 00:27:33,874
The Palestinian will take care of their own freedom.

331
00:27:33,874 --> 00:27:35,569
You don't need to worry about that one.

332
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:41,449
All you need to do as much as possible,
is try to not participate within the occupation.

333
00:27:41,449 --> 00:27:47,291
Now, I travel through Israel and nobody, who 
travels through Israel is allowed to endorse

334
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:52,928
the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign,
because that would be illegal and would mean

335
00:27:52,928 --> 00:27:54,614
I could not travel through Israel.

336
00:27:54,614 --> 00:27:58,572
However some people consider it to be a
nonviolent way of participating against

337
00:27:58,572 --> 00:28:01,736
the occupation.

338
00:28:01,736 --> 00:28:06,942
Now, what we do need to do is figure out
what happens the day after occupation

339
00:28:06,942 --> 00:28:15,887
that's what worries me. For example there is
a Coca Cola bottling company being built

340
00:28:15,887 --> 00:28:22,288
in the Gaza Strip. Why? It's going to use more
water than the entire Gaza Strip has available to it.

341
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:27,200
More concrete than in all of the construction
projects. Why?

342
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,722
Because they are looking for the day after
occupation.

343
00:28:30,722 --> 00:28:34,911
And what I don't want is for Palestine to turn
into South Africa.

344
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:41,923
Beautiful dreams, excellent vision and you 
loose the war the day after the occupation ends.

345
00:28:41,923 --> 00:28:45,510
That's why we have to encourage
these democratic institutions.

346
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:50,612
That's why we have to participate in these, I guess
essentually like chaos based

347
00:28:50,612 --> 00:28:55,696
anarchist based collectives, that are going to move
forward the democratic process there

348
00:28:55,696 --> 00:28:59,509
and everywhere else.

349
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:05,409
*applause*

350
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:11,149
Herald: So we have time for one final question.
The microphone at the right please.

351
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:16,374
Question: The big one. Can you say something 
about the interface between open medical devices

352
00:29:16,374 --> 00:29:23,090
and regulation? So in Europe most of the stuff is
public or a lot of it is public, so you have two layers

353
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,649
of regulation: one is what devices you're authorised
to use and operating on the human body.

354
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:31,848
The other one is how you're authorised
to buy the stuff,

355
00:29:31,848 --> 00:29:35,617
so procurement regulation is very, very rigid
in some European countries

356
00:29:35,617 --> 00:29:41,032
in term of medical devices. Most of the stuff
would be illegal.

357
00:29:41,032 --> 00:29:46,169
Tarek: It was very important for us, the project
wasn't, you know, people have made stethoscopes

358
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:51,115
and actually a lot of people told me this. They
said, your's isn't the first 3D printed stethoscope.

359
00:29:51,115 --> 00:29:53,622
I made one, we made one, whatever it is.

360
00:29:53,622 --> 00:29:57,460
And it is true, we are not nearly the first
3D printed stethoscope.

361
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:05,282
We are the first validated and now Health Canada
approved 3D printed stethoscope.

362
00:30:05,282 --> 00:30:13,183
I think that these regulations are actually
a good thing, because the population is

363
00:30:13,183 --> 00:30:16,575
an incredibly vulnerable population 
on the other side.

364
00:30:16,575 --> 00:30:20,701
We see a lots of experiments being run on poor,
disenfranchised people.

365
00:30:20,701 --> 00:30:23,154
It happens in the first world.
Think Tuskegee and

366
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,750
similar things are happening today.

367
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:31,796
It happens in the third world,
think Nestle and such projects.

368
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:34,825
So I think the regulations are a good thing.

369
00:30:34,825 --> 00:30:39,363
The FDA, you know, probably not. It's very 
expensive, very hard to get through.

370
00:30:39,363 --> 00:30:44,907
But it's not taxing to get through
reasonable regulatory bodies, like Health Canada.

371
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:51,099
I myself don't object. What I see in the Gaza Strip
is people there want to know

372
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:55,513
that they're not receiving garbage. So they're
asking for these regulatory approvals.

373
00:30:55,513 --> 00:31:01,961
The Gaza Strip will not use expired medical
devices, that people, you know well-wishers and

374
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:06,962
some hospital in the first world that decided
I like rather throw this away in the Gaza Strip

375
00:31:06,962 --> 00:31:10,443
than throw this away in the garbage.
No we don't want that.

376
00:31:10,443 --> 00:31:15,627
There is a dignity as well that has to be provided.
And that dignity comes with the same standards

377
00:31:15,627 --> 00:31:20,786
being met in the third world as in the first world

378
00:31:20,786 --> 00:31:26,538
Herald: OK, thank you very much. Unfortunately
we are out of time, but I hope you enjoy the

379
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:29,565
rest of the congress and see you at the next talk.

380
00:31:29,565 --> 00:31:38,249
*postroll music*
