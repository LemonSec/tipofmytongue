00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,474
*preroll music*

2
00:00:09,334 --> 00:00:12,669
Gregor Ruttner: Hello everybody, I'm really
excited to be here today

3
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:16,940
as this is not only my first congress as a
speaker but also a visitor

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,230
so I'm really stunned by what I've seen in
the last couple of days

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:28,030
So, I will talk about the art of failure taught
by improv theatre

6
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,770
and before I do that I will talk about theate
in general

7
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,129
First, you heard a bit about my profession

8
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:37,559
I work as a youth theatre leader,

9
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,909
so everyday I meet young people from the age
of 5 to 20, young adult,

10
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:48,499
and together we create a piece of theatre

11
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:52,050
And when you work with young people in the field of youth theatre

12
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,979
you borrow loads of methods of the improv theatre

13
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:00,560
and improv theatre give you a very special mindset

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,990
about how to fuse certain things in life

15
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,370
and about how to handle mistakes.

16
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,860
But as I said first, what is theatre?

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,890
So, theatre is, of course, like this.

18
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:18,640
So, it's loads of impressions, loads of expressions, loads of emotion,

19
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,350
it's very dramatic.

20
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,530
This is also where the word dramatic comes from: drama, theatre.

21
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,840
But when you look behind the curtain, theatre is sometimes like this:

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,370
So, you come to rehearsal, 
best prepared, and you're full of energy

23
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,600
and you want to give your best

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,500
and then there're all the others in the rehearsal and you think like:

25
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,640
why are they not here, 100%? Where is the energy?

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,000
Why didn't they learn the text? And, am I
the only one in here, who wants to work seriously?

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,070
What I can tell you is that the others in
your theatre group think the same, and also

28
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,100
about you

29
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:07,320
So, this is something in theatre that sometimes,
or most of the times, is because of this:

30
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,390
So, theatre is loads about text and memorizing lines

31
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,530
and I can talk about myself when I have acting jobs

32
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,260
So, it's quite easy to remember the lines
at home

33
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,750
when you're on your own and all all alone

34
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,910
and you know when to stop and then you know
that another person will say something

35
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,480
but you don't remember what the person will say

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,020
So, you don't know where to start again and
then your partner thinks, like,

37
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,700
he's not prepared. 
Like I'm waiting for you, where is your line?

38
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,980
So, you gonna have a bad time.

39
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,180
And theatre is about collaboration, about
cooperation

40
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,540
about doing something together

41
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:54,069
and this is very important and we will come
back to that in a few minutes again.

42
00:02:54,069 --> 00:03:00,240
But first the last picture, because this is
like the most important rule in theatre,

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,349
don't ever argue with the director.

44
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,430
Directors are... let's say, very special kind of people

45
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,930
They have a certain idea of what it should
look like on stage in their head

46
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,630
and they want you to put that on the stage

47
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,599
and of course you're not inside the head of
the director

48
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,810
so you cannot ever succeed.

49
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,630
So, if the director says, 
you have to stand there, just stand there.

50
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,019
And don't say: 
but here I think it would be better.

51
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,830
Just don't do it.

52
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:35,209
But, this is a very strict image of theatre
and this is of course traditional theatre

53
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:42,540
So, in the 20th century people came up with
the idea of improv theatre.

54
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,200
And this cannot happen to you when you do
improv theatre

55
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,540
So you cannot forget your lines, because improv
theatre is about doing something spontaneously,

56
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,629
create something great out of something that
hasn't been there a few seconds ago.

57
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:03,129
And, Improvtheatre is trained and not rehearsed

58
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:07,910
so, you call it an improv training and not
an improv rehearsal

59
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:13,450
because you have some games that you get to
know and then you train them with your partners

60
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,199
and later you will present them on the stage.

61
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,910
And, to giv you a short example of improv
theatre, I will play a video of an improv group

62
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,020
and they will play a game called 
"I am a tree"

63
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,600
and the game is called "I am a tree", because
at the start the person enters the stage and says:

64
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,130
I'm a tree, and becomes the tree with the
whole body

65
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,090
and then a second person enters the stage
immediately after that

66
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,660
so with the first thought he or she has, and
says for example:

67
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,710
I'm an apple, becomes the apple

68
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,180
and then a third person enters the stage with,
like, I'm a worm.

69
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:54,130
So we have tree, apple, worm. And then the
tree person chooses one other person and says,

70
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,030
I take it.

71
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,370
So for example, says: I take the worm.

72
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,240
And then the tree and the worm leave the stage
and the apple is all alone on the stage

73
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,820
and again repeats it: I'm an apple.

74
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,130
And then some people in the improv group,
when they think of apple they don't think

75
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,500
of the fruit, but of the computer company

76
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,050
so they say, like, I'm an iPhone, and make
themselves very thin

77
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,260
and then a third person comes and says, I'm
a bad battery life,

78
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,139
and is dying

79
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,630
Thank you for that (*laughs*)

80
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,729
Okay, but now let's have a look onto the video.

81
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:29,609
*Applause*

82
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:32,960
- Hi everybody, where gonna do some improv for you

83
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,290
it's completely unscripted created on the spot,

84
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,300
never to be seen again and never seen before.

85
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,410
- I am a tree
makes dinging sound

86
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,350
Audience: *Laughter*

87
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,160
- I'm a tree!
- I'm a butterfly

88
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,250
- I'm a tyre swing

89
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,590
- I'll take the tyre swing!

90
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,790
- I'm a butterfly
- I'm a branch

91
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,550
- I'm a falling leaf

92
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,620
- I'm a branch
- I'm a banker

93
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,310
- I'm a bowl of mints

94
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,930
- I'll take the banker!
- I'm a bowl of mints

95
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:13,210
- I'm a mint spoon
- I'm an awkward silence

96
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,400

97
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,330
- I'm an awkward silence
- I'm a boyfriend

98
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,790
- I'm a racoon

99
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,150

- I'm a boyfriend
- I'm a girlfriend

101
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,110

00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,880

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,370
- I'm a girlfriend

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:43,580

106
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,449

- I'm arthritis

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,569

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,960
- I'm a person with an ear
- I'm a person with neither of these things

112
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,870
- I take the person with the ear

113
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,900
- I'm a person with neiter of these things
- I am a giant bag of money

114
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,960
- I'm a burglar

115
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,900
- I take the bag of money
- I'm a burglar

116
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,150
- I'm an open window
- I'm a priceless antiquity

117
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,200

118
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,530

119
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,919
- I take the curtain
- I'm an escaping teen

120
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:33,960
- I'm a tree
*Laughter*

121
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,520
*Cheering*

122
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,080
*Applause*

123
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,389
Ruttner: So we see the game ends where there's
the tree again

124
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:45,080
so shouldn't last for more than 3 minutes
as we've seen here

125
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,550
but, why this also is a good example is, because
we've seen at some points

126
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,740
that 2 or even more people wanted to enter
the stage at the same time

127
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,730
but they managed that just one person did.

128
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,580
And this is very important, as I said.

129
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,819
Theatre is about collaboration, about team work

130
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:05,670
so, this is what you train in improv training.

131
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,260
At this point of the talk there will be a
quote, so there it is.

132
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,229
It's a quote from Keith Johnston

133
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:16,330
Keith Johnstone is like the godfather of improv theatre

134
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,599
He created the format of theatre sports

135
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,819
which is when 2 improv theatre groups come together

136
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:27,380
and play some special kinds of games against each other

137
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,760
and then the audience decides which group
did a better job and then the winner wins a small price

138
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:37,809
And he also invented most of the games that
are played in todays improve scene

139
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,349
For eample this "I am a Tree" game

140
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:43,990
So, and he says: "Good improvisors seem telepathic;

141
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,870
everything looks pre-arranged,

142
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,100
this is because they accept all offers made
--

143
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,130
which is something no 'normal' person would do."

144
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,920
So, and this is like the basic idea of improv theatre:

145
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,690
take every change you get, take all offers made.

146
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,410
Now we see another short video

147
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:08,930
This is a Google Tech Talk where Tina Fey
was invited by Eric Schmidt

148
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,360
who was at that time the CEO of Google, now
is the CEO of Alphabet, you know the stories

149
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:21,850
and he talks with Tina Fey, she's a very famous
American actress, writer, director and comedian

150
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,430
I'm sure most of you know her

151
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:29,810
And she explains in a very good way the basic
rules of improv

152
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:30,730
So let's have a look!

153
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,020
Eric Schmidt: It has a lot of lessons in it.
So for example,

154
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,279
Stop! I've got a gun!

155
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:39,630
Tina Fey: The gun, the gun I gave you for
our wedding anniversary, Eric?

156
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,600
How could you?

157
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,610
Schmidt: We're not married!
Fey: Aha! We're not married is a denial,

158
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,260
we've learned our first improv lesson

159
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,409
*Laughter*

160
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:53,760
Fey: It's very hard, it takes a long time
to learn

161
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,470
Schmidt: This is the problem with an engineer
trying to learn

162
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,980
Fey: *laughs*

163
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,290
Fey: It takes a long time to learn those basic
rules of improv

164
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,239
Schmidt: So why don't you take us 
through them, they're in the book

165
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:07,630
Fey: Sure, they're in the book, cause I have
visited improviser at Second City, and a place

166
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,390
called Improv Olympic in Chicago

167
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:15,450
and I talk in the book about improv having
really kind of changed my professional life

168
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,290
and even sort of my world view a bit

169
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,690
There're some basic rules of improvisation
when you're creating something out of nothing

170
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,570
The first rule is to agree, which is to say yes

171
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,410
which we didn't do that successfully

172
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:33,140
You said the phrase, I have a gun. And I didn't
say: That's not a gun, that's your finger

173
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,980
*Laughter*

174
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,140
Schmidt: Which is what a Google person would
say

175
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,890
Fey: Yeah, well I don't know
*Laughter*

176
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:44,060
Fey: And we agreed. And next rule is: Yes, and...

177
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,630
Which is to add-on to what you have already
agreed upon

178
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,250
So: The gun, the gun I gave you for our wedding
anniversary?

179
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,140
How could you?

180
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,370
And then we hit a brick wall, Eric

181
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,179
*Laughter*

182
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:58,589
But it's a very, you know... it's funny, because
some very famous comedians have...

183
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:04,920
there is an old story about Joan Rivers was
a The Second City briefly in 1959 ... 1960

184
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,430
and they used this in class at Second City all the time

185
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,990
that there was someone came in. you know

186
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,600
"I want a divorce" was the beginning of the scene

187
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,810
She said: I want a divorce. And whoever was
with her would say: But what about the children?

188
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,160
And she said: We don't have any children

189
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,510
Which in the moment got a big laugh

190
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,410
Schmidt: Which stops it.
Fey: but killed the scene.

191
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,480
And so that's a... It's a very...
Schmidt: My response would be...

192
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,450
Fey: Human Instinct
Schmidt: Yes, we have children, I just didn't tell you

193
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,380
that's why we're getting divorced
Fey: Yes, yes!

194
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,870
Fey: I have some other children...
Schmidt: Yes

195
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,670
Fey: This is exactly what, yeah

196
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,010
Ruttner: So at least Eric Schmidt learned
very fast

197
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,100
Okay, let's have a look onto the 4 rules she said

198
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,010
So, the first one is to agree, to say yes

199
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:50,610
So, when I say, for example:
Look what I've got here, it's the brand new iPhone 7

200
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,730
It has an astonishing battery life. 
It finally lasts for a whole day

201
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:59,669
then please don't say:
That's never possible, that must be a Samsung Galaxy

202
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:05,140
Don't say that, just say:
Oh cool

203
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,690
And then add something, this is the 2nd rule

204
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,529
Not only say "yes", say "yes, and...".

205
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:14,750
So, for example:
Oh cool, but I see you had to buy now this

206
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,550
fancy apple leather backpack to carry it with you

207
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:22,320
because now it is four times thicker than
before and it just cost, what did you say,

208
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,199
a 1000 Euros?

209
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:27,490
- Yes, now I can spend 2000 Euros for my phone,
isn't this amazing?

210
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,339
So, something like this.

211
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:33,089
The 3rd rule is: Make statements, so give
something to play with

212
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:35,260
Don't say: Look what I've got here!

213
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:40,690
Then this person can just say: Wow. What is it.

214
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,160
*Laughter*

215
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,050
And number 4 is: There are no mistakes, 
only opportunities,

216
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,380
which brings us back to the topic of this talk

217
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:53,269
So, when I say, look what I've got here, brand
new iPhone 7, astonishing battery life...

218
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:57,089
don't say, no, that must be a Samsung Galaxy,
as I just said.

219
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,930
But the person did. So what to do now?

220
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,190
Then, you can help, you see there was a mistake,
take it as an opportunity and say:

221
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,050
Oh, they are really good now at copying Apple's
design, even put an apple on the backside.

222
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,910
Something like this.

223
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:16,170
So, these are the four rules of improv by
Tine Fey and the last one, there are no mistakes,

224
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,190
only opportunities

225
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,419
So, what does that say to us?

226
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:24,669
Has it something to do with this very infamous
quote, "It's not a bug, it's a feature"?

227
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:27,710
Well, let's see

228
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,050
Important thing is to take every chance you
get, this is important

229
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:37,350
So, when you play improv theatre with another
person, then really take every chance you get

230
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,300
So, I give the person loads of stuff, like
it's the iPhone 7, it's brand new,

231
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,839
astonishing battery life and so on

232
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:47,930
So this person has many choices to play with now

233
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:53,709
Second, if something goes wrong, try to make
the best out of it, without pretend that it

234
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:54,480
didn't happen at all

235
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,990
So, everybody would figure out that he made
a mistake when he said, no, this must be a

236
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,459
samsung galaxy, oh, ah, I mean... yeah, nice iPhone

237
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:06,320
So, this is bad he wanted to pretend that
it didn't happen

238
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,630
So when we look onto it's not a bug, it's
a feature, we could rather say, like,

239
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:15,290
Yeah, it's a bug, and we even implemented
10 bugs and the person who finds all 10 of

240
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,540
them gets a very fancy price

241
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,660
So, something like this would be out of the
mind of improv theatre

242
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,310
And, the last point, most of the times there
is somebody to support you

243
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,959
I say most of the times, in improv theatre
always there is someone to support you

244
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:34,050
In life, yeah we know there are situations
where there isn't somebody to support you

245
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:38,019
But, if we have a closer look, in many situations
there would be somebody.

246
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:42,290
So in improv theatre, that means, like, when
I say: no, this is a Samsung Galaxy

247
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,200
And then this person stays, like, oh, what
to do now?

248
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,040
Then, a third person could enter the stage
of the improv group and says, like,

249
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,600
I'm a very fancy patent lawyer, I know all
the stuff about Samsung and Apple, so let

250
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,300
me have a look

251
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:02,339
So then it would be 3 people and at that time
the other 2 could think about it

252
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:05,079
Now we have a look onto Del Close's 11 Commandments

253
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:06,800
So he has not 4 rules, but 11

254
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:18,690
Del Close was a very famous and very popular
coach on improv for actors and for comedians

255
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,050
And he had these 11 commandments

256
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,519
So let us have a look onto number 1, it's:

257
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,910
"You are all supporting actors"

258
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:31,370
Again, theatre is about collaboration, it's
team work based

259
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:36,790
So, when you work in a team don't try to be
the best in the team, because then you are

260
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,760
not a team, then you are against each other

261
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,880
So, when you work in a team, do it a a team,
you are all supporting actors, this is number 1

262
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,220
Number 2: Always check your impulses

263
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:51,990
So, when you want to take every chance you
get, you have to look out for them, so, where

264
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,250
could be a chance to get?

265
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,880
So be aware all the time.

266
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,959
Number 3: Never enter a scene unless you are
needed.

267
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,769
This is very important, especially for example
for me, when I work with young people every day

268
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:09,420
So, of course there will be some situations
where we think:

269
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,360
Yeah, the young people won't manage to do
it,

270
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,839
I have to step in now and help them,
but most of the times that's not necessary

271
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:22,290
and as we heard, at Jugend Hackt today, like,
of course they do mistakes, but they learn

272
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,740
somethings of the mistakes

273
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,289
So, really, just enter the scene when you
are needed

274
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:31,449
and not few seconds before

275
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:35,370
And this is very hard to manage and you have
to train that also

276
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,410
because when you're doing improv theatre you
always want to be on the stage of course

277
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:44,529
so, be sure to just enter the stage when you're needed

278
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:48,240
Number 4: Save your fellow actor, don't worry
about the piece

279
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,770
This is also important, when you work in a
team, and somebody needs help,

280
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,180
or struggles a bit around

281
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,660
like this no, this must be Samsung Galaxy,
don't think, oh, you have ruined the scene,

282
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,710
what can we do now?

283
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:07,859
Just do something to help your partner and
the piece will be good again

284
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:12,169
Number 5: Your prime responsibility is to
support

285
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:14,769
As we just heard, so you all work in a team

286
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:18,759
so don't play against each other, play together

287
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:23,989
support each other and then the outcome will
be much more nicer

288
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:27,579
Number 6: Work at the top of your brains at
all times

289
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,200
This is the important thing, act out your
first thought

290
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,399
So when we look back on this I am a Tree thing,
like, the person first enters the stage

291
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:37,450
I am a Tree

292
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,509
and the other is like, hm, tree, this could
be in a forest,

293
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:42,429
this could be garden

294
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:46,789
oh, it's christmas at the moment, I could
do something about christmas trees...

295
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:49,340
The audience doesn't get your thoughts, they
just see what you do

296
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:55,549
So, in reality nothing would happen in this
10 seconds while the person thinks

297
00:17:55,549 --> 00:18:00,479
So when your first thought is tree, forest,
then do something in a forest and don't think

298
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,940
too much about it

299
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,989
Number 7: Never underestimate or condescend
to your audience

300
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:09,200
So, when you have an idea, just do it

301
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,120
you can think later, when the piece is over,

302
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,679
did the audience get
what I wanted to tell them

303
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:18,189
Because of course at least one person will get

304
00:18:18,189 --> 00:18:23,799
what you want to show
and most of the times everybody got it

305
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:27,389
Number 8: No jokes unless it is tipped in
front that it is a joke

306
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:31,700
So, if you want to be funny, it's always good
not to try to be funny

307
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,260
So, the most funniest situations on the stage
come out

308
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,950
when you don't prepare a joke
and want to do something

309
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,619
just act in the moment and then

310
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,619
the most funniest situations will come up

311
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:46,220
and of course when you enter the stage:
"Do you want to hear a joke?"

312
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,030
and the other person says yes,

313
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,410
then don't say, no, I'm not allowed,

314
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,410
but then tell your damn joke
but then continue the scene

315
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,240
Number 9: Trust is very important

316
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,779
Trust your fellow actors to support you,
trust them to come through

317
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:01,330
if you lay something heavy on them

318
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,409
and trust yourself is also important

319
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:07,549
To be able to trust my partners I have to
trust myself at the very beginning

320
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:10,529
then we can trust each other as a group and
we can rely on each other

321
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:12,210
So, again, team work.

322
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,099
When we do something as a team,

323
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:17,599
everybody in the team has to be sure
that what will come out

324
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,789
will come out in a very good way
because we're a very good team

325
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:25,600
and this is why we are a team, because we
help each other and support each other

326
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,940
Number 10: Avoid judging what is going down

327
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,919
This is very important. Don't be on the stage
and think all the time,

328
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,529
no, he broke one of these rules
this is very bad

329
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:41,070
Just do something, because when you start
looking for mistakes, you will find them

330
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:46,549
and this is something I'm sure everybody of
you have seen that in your own life

331
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:48,899
when you start to look for mistakes you will
find them

332
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:53,049
So in improv theatre this is the rule, don't
look for mistakes, then you won't find any

333
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:57,840
because every mistake is an opportunity,
don't look for mistakes, but for opportunities

334
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,700
And the last commandment is: Listen

335
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,950
So again, when you work in a team,
you have to listen to each other

336
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,320
It's like spot every chance you get,
listen to each other

337
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,299
when I do something,
the other has to know about that.

338
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:16,519
Whichs brings us to a second quote:

339
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:19,159
Again, one of Keith Johnstone's quotes

340
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:25,269
"There are people you prefer to say 'yes'
and there are people who prefer to say 'no'.

341
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:28,019
Those you say 'yes' are rewarded
by the adventures they have.

342
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:31,220
Those who say 'no' are rewarded
by the safety they attain."

343
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,609
And this brings us to the motto of this congress,
Gated Communities.

344
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,999
Of course you can stay in your community
and maybe, or for sure,

345
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:43,519
this is very comfortable
and nothing will happen to you

346
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,459
and you are protected in your community

347
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:48,209
but you will miss so many things
that are out there

348
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:50,459
when you step out of your community

349
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:53,799
So, say Yes and then you get new adventures

350
00:20:53,799 --> 00:21:01,070
So, this is what I want to end with because
this is also the motto of this congress,

351
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,150
break the borders, break the rules,
stay hungry

352
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,220
Thank you very much

353
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:17,169
*Applause*

354
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:19,320
Herald: Thanks very much for the talk

355
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,650
So if you have any questions, please line
up at the microphones

356
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:29,349
and we will get you answers to that

357
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:31,330
No questions from the internet...

358
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,070
Oh there is a questions over there
at mic number 7

359
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:42,139
Q: Do you practice your talk
or do you improvise?

360
00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:47,909
Ruttner: Very good question, I'm sure you
heard it, I'm not a native english speaker

361
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:53,720
so I said in the beginning when we had a quick
chat before, like, when I would have done

362
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,159
the talk in German I would have improvised

363
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:02,219
As it is in English, I improvised it once,
tried to remember it, this was 3 days ago,

364
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:03,729
at home

365
00:22:03,729 --> 00:22:07,359
and then yesterday and today I repeated it
again

366
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:13,039
so, like again, not a rehearsal, I didn't
have notes or anything, I just tried to repeat

367
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,149
it and to train it

368
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:17,099
so, yeah, kind of

369
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:20,239
Engel: Okay, mic number 2

370
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:23,940
Q: I once had an improv course and I definitely
want to do it again

371
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,570
especially after just seeing your talk, so
thanks for the opportunity

372
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,720
Ruttner: Thank you

373
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,759
Q: What I wondered about, I have another friend
at another conference or so,

374
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,379
and he also did improv theatre and during
the conference they actually just played with

375
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:39,039
each other a bit

376
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,379
Do you know about these real life, like...
you know there is the improv theatre thing,

377
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:45,759
where you just are in some room

378
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,549
and you meet for the games and all that stuff

379
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:52,039
but the interaction like in reality

380
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:56,830
like even up to a game where you go like,
okay let's go to the hotel and try to get

381
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,019
a booked room, or something, you know?

382
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:02,710
Ruttner: Yeah, this is more like a training
for improv, it is like one of those shows

383
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,090
so it is a very good training of course, let's
try something out in the real world

384
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:09,549
so, this is called the hidden theatre

385
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:15,039
This could be improvised, because you don't
know what will happen when you are in a public space

386
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,690
what will the other people say, when you don't
tell them the hidden theatre

387
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,840
so of course you have to train improv for
that

388
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,159
but this genre is called hidden theatre

389
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,849
Q: But it is also part of the improve theme, basically

390
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:28,499
Ruttner: Yeah, you can train improv by doing it

391
00:23:28,499 --> 00:23:29,679
Q: Okay, thanks

392
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:30,859
Ruttner: You're welcome

393
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:33,909
Engel: Next question from mic number 1 please

394
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:37,279
Q: I don't know anything about improv until now

395
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,129
but I'm very excited about that I am a Tree
game, and want to play it later

396
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:44,549
can you also maybe recommend another improv
game for noobs?

397
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:49,519
Ruttner: Yeah, I can definitely send you some
written down, so we can meet afterwards

398
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,289
I also wrote into the talk describtion that
there will be a workshop

399
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:58,519
this was very optimistic because I wanted
to do the talk first and then want to know

400
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:00,700
who would be interested in a workshop

401
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,179
so, if you find me after this talk and we are more 
than 3 people who say I want to do the workshop

402
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:07,029
we can do something together tomorrow

403
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,840
*Applause*

404
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:18,649
Ruttner: (*laughing*) More than 3 but
not more than 20 please

405
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:22,529
Engel: Okay, so thanks very much for attending
the talk

406
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:24,210
Thanks very much for giving the talk

407
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:30,320
If you have any more questions to Gregor,
please find him in the foyer in front of the

408
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,969
Hall 2. Thank you

409
00:24:33,144 --> 00:24:38,444
