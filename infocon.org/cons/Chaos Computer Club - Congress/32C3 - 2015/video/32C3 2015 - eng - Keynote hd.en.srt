00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,809
*preroll music*

2
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:13,619
Linus Neumann: My dear community!

3
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:19,210
Now the moment you’ve all been waiting for

4
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,050
without even knowing
what that moment would be.

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:29,070
As hackers we think a lot
about virtual gates

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,940
and how to overcome them.

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,940
But away from keyboard
our competence and resources

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,020
in overcoming gates
are maybe limited a bit.

9
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:51,489
So for this motto we had to find
a very special keynote speaker.

10
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:57,329
Somebody with experience
of overcoming physical gates

11
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:03,040
or borders, as some people call them.

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,359
Our keynote speaker has overcome
physical borders twice.

13
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:13,719
She was born in Somalia and escaped
to Kenya when she was still a child.

14
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:20,499
And just recently she escaped Kenya
to search refuge here, in Germany.

15
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:25,429
Carina Haupt: She hates the term “refugee”.

16
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:30,159
Instead, she prefers the term: “newcomer”.

17
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,869
She worked with international
humanitarian organizations

18
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:36,679
in the Dadaab Refugee Camp in Kenya.

19
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:43,429
So not only does she know
these camps as visitor

20
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:47,829
but also as an humanitarian aid worker.

21
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:53,179
Linus: We’re curious for her unique
perspectives and insights.

22
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,909
Please welcome Fatuma Musa Afrah!

23
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:56,450
*applause*

24
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,219
microphone does not work

25
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:51,650
Angel: You have to take that microphone, please.
Fatuma: laughing Oh, what’s going on?

26
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,160
For an hour, this! Okay.

27
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,620
I’m not used to this anyway,

28
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,540
I’m friend more with this!
points at handset mike

29
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,340
But when I get tired,
I hope I will keep it somewhere.

30
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,650
Thank you so much, dear Linus
and the beautiful Carina

31
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,050
for this beautiful introduction.

32
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:17,070
I have no words to say. I remember
when Linus wrote me this long email

33
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,430
and asking me: “We would love
to have you here” and I was like:

34
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,340
“What is Chaos Computer Club?”
I just gave him a call

35
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,780
after I received the mail from him.
And he was like: “You will understand,

36
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,490
for now you don't know, but:
Can we please meet and discuss this?”

37
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,240
And I was like: “In the field of IT,
that I don’t know anything about?"

38
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:42,160
The only thing I know about it
is the basic use of my Laptop,

39
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:49,000
which is a compulsory thing to do
because of the world we're at right now.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,140
And I would like to ask everybody
in the audience to give

41
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,640
a very heavy round of 'pplause
for the man who succeeded

42
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,270
in bringing me here because I can’t
say other things because of being

43
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:08,050
in front of you. Thank you
so much to Linus and the Angels.

44
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:19,048
Can we give a round of applause?
*applause*

45
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:26,199
I told him actually that time:
"You are a damn good business marketer!"

46
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,379
That’s actually the term I used.
And he told me:

47
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:35,099
“Oh yeah, I gotta try what it takes
to bring you here.”

48
00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:37,930
And I was like: “Thank you so much for
having me here.”

49
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,460
Before I proceed to dip into – huh huh –

50
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,520
the one long hour which
I hardly did it, to be honest.

51
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,270
With other combination, yes,
as a motivational speaker.

52
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,039
But just one good hour talking by myself?
laughs

53
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:55,800
This is a beautiful experience,
and to be honest

54
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,159
I haven’t been in front of this huge,
larg..., damn big audience.

55
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:09,099
I’m used to maybe … heh, is it strange
to say 2000?

56
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:13,569
laughs
Ya, I don’t know.

57
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:18,629
I’m just so grateful, feel so honored,
humbled to have me here.

58
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:22,889
And the majority of you being hackers.
I don’t know what “hacker” means,

59
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:26,120
but somehow I understand what
it means after the long discussion

60
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,669
and several meetings that I had
with my dear Linus.

61
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:34,270
I don’t know, sometimes I pronounce the
German names wrongly, don’t get me wrong,

62
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:39,189
like I remember Carina telling me:
“The English speaking people and other

63
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:42,800
people have a problem with my name
the way it’s pronounced." And I was like:

64
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,139
“Okay, how do they pronounce it?”
– "Carrrina" (German rolling “r”)

65
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:49,639
And I said: “I know that: Carina”
(perfect pronounciation)

66
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,699
I have the German-typical “r” with me.

67
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:54,860
I’m just very shocked here
in Deutschland (Germany), like,

68
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,189
one year and eight month soon
graduates into two complete years.

69
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:00,979
Und, mein Deutsch ist kaputt, aber…
(my German is broken, but…)

70
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:01,009
*laughter, applause*

71
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:01,089
Vielen Dank!
(Thank you!)

72
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:05,520
Ich spreche ein bisschen Deutsch.
(I speak a little German.)

73
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,020
Ich bin in die Schule drei Monaten,
(I am in school three months,)

74
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,449
aber ich verstehe nicht so gut Deutsch.
(but I don’t understand German very well.)

75
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:13,349
Warum?
(Why?)

76
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:13,800
laughs

77
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,120
Deutsch ist schwer.
(German is hard.)

78
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,889
Aber habe hier andere Menschen oder Leute,
(but I’ve got other people here)

79
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:27,059
nicht die sprechen Deutsch?
(not who speaks German?)

80
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:32,870
laughing Aber ich viel besser auf Englisch!
(But I much better in English!)

81
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,309
Did you understand my Deutsch (German)
from that practice? *applause*

82
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:41,409
Thank you.
*applause*

83
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:44,289
I gotta practice my Deutsch whenever
I go in public, otherwise

84
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:49,990
I will stay forgotten in my language because
I consider it my language right now

85
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,409
because I belong to this community.
I’m a German!

86
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:58,419
Some people will ask me: “You are a German?”
shyly: “Aha?”

87
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,869
You understand, obviously, when you tell somebody
"I'm a German" in THIS! points at her clothing

88
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:06,029
You understand what I mean?
I don’t have to explain (laughs) in detail.

89
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:10,569
And I remember one guy told me: “Hey,
how are you?” – I met him in an event

90
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:14,960
And I said: “Cool.” And he said: “What’s
your name?” And I said: “My name is Fatuma.”

91
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,669
And he said: “Where do you come from?”
I told him: “From a human world.”

92
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:25,349
And he said: “Huh, human world?”
*applause*

93
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:27,159
Thank you!

94
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:32,529
"What did you expect me to give you
as an answer?"

95
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:36,319
And he said: “Yeah, well, I don’t
know, this is a typical question,

96
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,759
as Germans we ask everytime.”
And I asked him: “Don’t behave

97
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,110
like the Germans behave,
behave as who you are!

98
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,610
Don’t bring me like I’m a dumb and I’m
a

99
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,289
Somalian this, and... I don’t believe in
that!

100
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:53,149
I believe in an individual choice,
an individual decision

101
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:57,710
and an individual mind for love.
That’s what I believe in.

102
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,740
sternly: Don’t follow what
other says because they say it

103
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,419
or you found it there. Be creative
and find a way to change things

104
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:11,009
And how we do it?
Is within us.

105
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:13,449
*applause*

106
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:18,309
Thank you!
Going directly to the concept today,

107
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:23,129
Gated Community,
I wanna be honest with you.

108
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:27,699
When Linus came to me and asked me:
“We want you to be our keynote speaker,

109
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:32,190
do you understand what a Gated
Community means?” And I told him:

110
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,240
"Obviously, yes.”
And he said: “What is it?”

111
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,470
And I told him: “Coming together.”
laughs I wanna be honest!

112
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:45,850
And today it’s so funny after the long
explanation he gave me

113
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,810
I gotta be standing here,
in front of this big, beautiful audience,

114
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,680
listening to me about Gated Community,
a topic connected to Gated Community.

115
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,600
So, learning is a process.
We don’t know everything

116
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,460
and I wanna be honest I didn’t know much
about Gated Community until

117
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,930
he brought up the topic and he said:
“I believe you can do it.”

118
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,220
Thanks Linus for giving me the belief
to be here

119
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,550
and make it happen in a possible way.
Thank you so much

120
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,600
for the deep explanation. And thank you
so much to everybody in the audience

121
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,380
for taking your beautiful time.
The Angels – I’m part of them,

122
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,870
you see what I have?
I’m part of them. I didn’t do much,

123
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,560
I was just feeding myself with my
small belly.

124
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,900
But I tried, somehow. I want to connect
the concept of Gated Community

125
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,660
through a simple… and funny story

126
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,410
while my stay here in Deutschland.

127
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:47,190
I’m usually a quick speaker
but today I gotta slow down

128
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,710
for everybody to understand me
and also to kill the one hour.

129
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,910
Don’t you think it’s too long to be here
for one good hour?

130
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,070
I’m already damn thirsty so I gotta have
some water in the process

131
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,970
before I start my funny–

132
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,710
I’m not used to gassed water, is this with
gas? Don’t make me vomit on this stage!

133
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,070
laughter

134
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:11,900
louder: Can I have water without gas?
I had already some problem with this.

135
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,360
Sorry.

136
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,660
No, I can’t take this, sorry.

137
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,990
I can’t shake it! Shake it yourself.

138
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,410
laughter

139
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:26,780
So, going to this funny story
about Deutschland;

140
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,240
what a beautiful children
that I worked with.

141
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,380
This will be part of my deeper story later.

142
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,010
I taught a German school as an
English assistant teacher because

143
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,080
I was not a professional,
annoyedly clears her throat

144
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,130
I was not a professional English teacher.

145
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,190
Neither do I have any
experience in teaching.

146
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,830
But I just wanted to contribute
and give something back

147
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,700
to the German community
since they where trying their best

148
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,120
to give us something, you know?
And I went out,

149
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,060
I remember, to our manager and
asked him how – which I will go back

150
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:04,880
to this story later in deep – but the
funny story about it is that the children,

151
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,820
they saw me in this outfit
– from head to toe –

152
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,180
and I could not speak German
most of the time.

153
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,390
I had very nice teachers who were translating
hand-to-hand with me all the time

154
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,670
because this school had almost three
hundred and sixty-something children

155
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:25,320
and all of them were in this Brandenburg
– you know Brandenburg?

156
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:32,380
The beautiful Brandenburg? –
...Most of them were blonde.

157
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,940
And then one of the child told me:
higher pitched: "Frau Fatumo..."

158
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,290
I said: "Yees, bitte??"
interrupts

159
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:43,250
to Angel on stage: Thank you so so much!
I honestly appreciate it!

160
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,100
Thank you so much!
*applause*

161
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:51,590
You give applause to the man
who feeds the Poor People!

162
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:57,310
Thanks! *laughs*
thanks!

163
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,700
So this child asked me...
The children were wondering all the time

164
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,420
– because of how I'm covered –
if I have ears;

165
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:11,110
they were doubting if I have hair. You know
that like the normal human functionings.

166
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,640
laughs

167
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,120
And then these children all the time busy
touching me if I'm really a human,

168
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:22,520
everywhere, you know?
Another problem was this: that skin color.

169
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,570
And one of the children asked me.

170
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,060
She was so intelligent, she
was so in love with me, that...

171
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,450
she was so nice and kind, you know?

172
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,730
Love and kindness doesn't come with
the language, it comes from the heart.

173
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,400
And this child was all the time
bringing me drawings with love

174
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,240
from her family and everything...
bringing it to me and say:

175
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,550
higher pitched: "Ha, da, warte mal,
ich hab' hier DAS, ich hab' hier DAS!

176
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:48,930
And I am like "Okay, thank you so much!"
and then I kept piling these stuffs

177
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,910
from the children, actually I didn't wanna
throw because they were my first family

178
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:57,580
when I was just 4-months-old in Deutschland,
when I felt my life is over,

179
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,450
I have no more family, I'm all alone.

180
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:07,260
My life is completely different again,
I got to struggle in this lifestyle.

181
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,970
So... this lady took me to the wash room.

182
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,630
And she said: higher pitched: "Yeah, bla bla."
I didn't understand, I asked the teacher

183
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,940
and the children like: "What... where do
you wanna take her?"

184
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,460
...to the wash room and then she did
immediately higher-pitched: "feeeee!"

185
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,290
...to confirm the hair is there
She did peek to confirm I have ears.

186
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:29,300
She left me alone. So another child
asked me, because of the skin color

187
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:38,870
because it was different from the whole
school: if I become white during night!

188
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:43,030
laughter

189
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:47,270
And I said: "Come again!"
Honestly!

190
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,680
If something keeps my day going,
laughs

191
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,990
Whenever I remember this, whether I'm
alone or whether I'm with somebody,

192
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:59,820
I just laugh, because this explains
about the world we live in.

193
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,360
And the answer I gave the child was:
"I'm black always."

194
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,280
high pitched: "Was?"
And then they were concerned why here is

195
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,780
points at inner side of hand
different from here.

196
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:16,500
shows outer side of hand
To go to the point this is apparent failure

197
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,680
and this is the meaning of a
Gated Community. As a parent

198
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,200
it's upon our responsibility
to educate our childen

199
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:32,820
about what kind of world we live in.
Educate them about EVERYTHING!

200
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,790
*applause*

201
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:41,030
Thank you!
Thank you so much.

202
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:45,100
I don't think these children will
be so busy about all of THIS

203
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,970
if the parent would have given them
the proper education they needed

204
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,550
by just showing them at least
something about it like we exist

205
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:57,280
in a world of diversed communities
in terms of color,

206
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:03,070
in terms of eyes appearance in terms
of height, in terms of everything.

207
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,510
So I hope from there those
children have learnt something

208
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,200
– I never hold any grudge
against innocent children –

209
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,880
They are so beautiful, so kind,
they're just curious, you know?

210
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,970
When they're growing up they're so beautiful.
I'm hoping to have five kids soon,

211
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:20,600
and... Hopefully, too, they'll be beautiful.
I want to have my own choir,

212
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,200
my own community in my own house.
But I,... yeah!

213
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,210
We'll light for these 5 kids,
hopefully, one day.

214
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:30,279
And, that was the story
about the children.

215
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:35,050
And now in connection with "Gated
Community" like I said previously -

216
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:41,010
I don't wanna do a lot of repetition:
Let us stand up for change!

217
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,600
Let us stand up for information!
Let us stand up

218
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,180
for connecting each other to reality!

219
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,250
Let us inform each other what's there!

220
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,310
Find a way to communicate!
Find a way to open these gates!

221
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:05,279
And how you open these gates
everybody has the key in the own hand,

222
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,990
in their own mind, however you
describe it. It's a responsibility

223
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:14,620
that it is within each and
every individual within us.

224
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,680
I remember educating my Mom -
'cause I grew up,

225
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,900
as you can see, the description from me,
a religious family.

226
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,180
And I'm not doing this
because they forced me to

227
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,600
but this is me what I wanted to.

228
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,870
Just to have a point of clear understanding
about what I'm explaining.

229
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,860
My Mom, I remember
educating her everytime:

230
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,279
"Mommy, ... !". Because I had a lot of friends
when I was in the university

231
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,740
who were Christians and I used to tell mama

232
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,430
"We got to open our arms for everybody!"
She was so kind and generous, definitely.

233
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,400
But they're these kind of levels of
helping each other that we need to.

234
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,420
And failure to do that: nobody else will.

235
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,839
We have to respect each other,
regardless of who we are.

236
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,660
Personally, I don't care about stupid color,

237
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,910
this plays no role in my world whatsoever.

238
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:17,459
I don't care about THIS,
this is an individual belief.

239
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:24,180
That's up to YOU. I don't discriminate
people against their social status.

240
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,530
I believe in a world of respect.

241
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:34,010
I believe in a world belonging to
people with respect and peace.

242
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,860
And that's all I go for. No more, no less!

243
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,460
Just respect, passion, based on the heart
That's what I go for.

244
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,540
As long as you can respect me and we can
understand each other

245
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,880
what else do I look for, more?
Absolutely nothing.

246
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,400
I just respect you, who you are.
The good respect and connections we have,

247
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,760
and that's all I go for. The rest is bullshit.

248
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,070
*applause*

249
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:13,510
They call it "Cheers!". This is my alcohol,
I've never drunk alcohol...

250
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,630
and will I ever!
small fraction applauding

251
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,290
surprisingly shouting:
Aaah! Applause for my alcohol!

252
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,710
Can we have applause for my
alcohol drinking!? *laughs*

253
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,230
This is funny!
*laughs*

254
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:32,200
And the other funny story
I would like to share

255
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,650
– but this has nothing to do
with Gated Community -

256
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:41,410
is, you know, the developed world.

257
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,220
It will have something to do with it
in the Gated Community section,

258
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:53,480
depending on how I explain it.

259
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,830
When I was new in Deutschland,

260
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,660
where I come from there are no trains.

261
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,410
I'm not used to trains, honestly.
I'm used to planes! descending whistle

262
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,520
They are easy, yes. But trains: NO!

263
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,090
So, laughs one of the drama thing
that happened to me when I came to German'

264
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:21,040
the first time I came by flight then the next
I remember I went to Frankfurt the first time.

265
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,100
And then I asked. I was told: "Go to the train!"

266
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:31,090
Now the problem was: chuckles
I see this LONG train! chuckles again

267
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:35,610
This has nothing to do with education.
No matter, how you're educated.

268
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:40,400
Some things don't need multi education
but needs to be used to that.

269
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,860
So I remember going to the train.

270
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:50,210
The first train left me because
I didn't know how to open!

271
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,710
And I was a newcomer – don't call us
refugees, a point of correction.

272
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,120
Call me by my name!
If that's not enough,

273
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,730
call me any other more beautiful name,
choose! I don't restrict, I believe

274
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,540
in a world of freedom. But as long as
it's beautiful and not insulting

275
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,600
then I give you the freedom.

276
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:15,170
So, the first train left me, so
I had to stand there in this cold.

277
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,559
Luckily enough I got the help from a woman
that I even didn't know.

278
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,270
But God knows what was going in my head.
I thought like, because I had a bad information

279
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:27,059
about Deutschland until I discovered
slowly by slowly by myself

280
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:35,050
that: don't listen to what others say,
listen to your heart!

281
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,570
I went with this woman,
she saved me.

282
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,110
We will come back to this
bigger story later.

283
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,840
raising voice again:
So, what did I had to do to open the next

284
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,080
train

285
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,960
which will be coming in 40 minutes?
I stood there trying to calculate,

286
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,510
and I didn't want to look ignorant,
you know? This is the worst thing!

287
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,990
You better ask than pretending to
know something and you don't know!

288
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,330
This is the worst thing a human
being should ever do.

289
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:01,910
So I stood there, I said: "Next time
when the train comes...",

290
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,170
because I was in the end and then I came
in the middle, where there're some people,

291
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:10,160
so that I stand next to the people.
When they open I go in with them.

292
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,020
I look where they open, and then I stand
behind them and then I get in there.

293
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:20,230
Otherwise I'll end up in a ship, (?)
left again by the second train.

294
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,350
So educating yourself in a culture,

295
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,250
in a very developed country
that you don't know

296
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,470
is a big risk and it's a big challenge.
Anyway,

297
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,920
the second train did not leave me
because I folled the followers.

298
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,910
And she pressed, she got in another person
– that was an old man –

299
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,929
I was so kind to give him a way because
I got to get in anyway.

300
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:42,150
So I got in! I was safe!

301
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:46,900
The next step: using the toilet.
How the hell do I use the toilet?

302
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:52,020
chuckles I wanna be honest,
I don't wanna hide anything.

303
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,650
I got in the toilet!
I saw a woman comin' out, I got it,

304
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,110
and this toilet were Automatic Toilet!

305
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,760
chuckling, losing words by that: And I
got stuck there .. for toilet .. five minute!

306
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:08,000
I tried to open, it doesn't open,
I tried to open.

307
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,710
The next time I didn't miss the...
try touching the Alarm.

308
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,850
imitates alarm sound:
WEEE OOOO WEEE OOOO WEEEK

309
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:18,820
I was like: "Why the hell is Polizei coming
!?"

310
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,309
chuckles

311
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:22,809
Anyway, they're kind they helped
me while I sweated too much

312
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:25,850
thinking "My life is...", "What the hell
is going on?" "Where did I...?"

313
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:30,640
"Where am I?" I didn't know, honestly.
And this was so hard for me.

314
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,610
So, in connections that this what
I wanna say is: Please give information

315
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:40,330
to the newcomers when they're coming.
Try to sacrifice a little bit of your time.

316
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,140
It's similar to you guys when you come
to Africa, we have these beautiful toilets,

317
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,890
that inside whatever you put 
from behind inside, you will sit!

318
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:52,450
So if you go to these big holes and sit there
you will be shocked, as well!

319
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:58,590
Like: "This might... I might die inside...
The toilet is looking at me!"

320
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:03,710
This is a reality, that's where we are from.
Can we give the beautiful toilets in Africa

321
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:11,190
a big applause?
*applause*

322
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,380
Thank you!

323
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:20,860
Going to the Gated Community issues,
please, if I'm too fast, you don't understand

324
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:25,720
the little English that I've learnt kindly
raise your hand, I give you the freedom

325
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,760
to ask me "Please slow down!", or "Please
use very simple terminologies!"

326
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,040
It's a gift, I give it to you. So, if I'm
too fast also that will be a nice idea from

327
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,140
you

328
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:44,840
because we have to kill the 1 hour together.
Just tell me. It's not a necessary thing.

329
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:51,620
So anyway, the developed world

330
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:55,580
– I don't wanna point any specific country
–

331
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,690
not only the developed world, even the
developing world, we have all these different

332
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:04,710
kinds of gated communities.
Whether it's in a profession, whether it's

333
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:04,929
just

334
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:11,160
a small settlement of communities.
In all directions, these exist.

335
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:17,120
It's a fact which is there. And I always
hoped for a perfect world

336
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,559
which is never gonna be so soon or it's
gonna be there at all. I don't think so.

337
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:28,130
You'll always dream of this perfect world
which there is no killing, no war,

338
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:33,360
no disrespect, no racism or whatever.
But this will be a long jouney!

339
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:40,530
And the journey belongs to all of us.
How we view it, how we wanna make a change,

340
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:47,850
it's a decision that belongs collectively
to all of us. I don't know how to do IT,

341
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:53,440
but before the... I will be here for 4 good
days, I hope I'll have some basic

342
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:00,360
– I have basic, of course, computer usage,
I have some – but the bigger one, well,

343
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,290
everybody: what is wrong with that IT
experts? They're always like this...

344
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,910
You're sitting next to them like I was
yesterday, yeah, sitting next to people...

345
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,000
People are busy: pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop!
And I was like: "These are machines or

346
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,390
human beings?"

347
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:20,330
Sorry, I don't meant to disrespect
or insult, sorry.

348
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:24,549
But you got to raise your head a bit up
and see the next person sitting.

349
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:30,540
Some people are looking at me very strangely,
wondering what kind of a hacker is this woman?

350
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:35,480
Honestly, I had a lot of looks like this until
I was asking people next to me what's going

351
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:35,600
on,

352
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,910
is there something wrong with me,
check me out!

353
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:41,290
And it was like "You are perfectly fine,
maybe... these are hackers, they have

354
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,620
never seen a hacker like you".
And I said: "The world is changing,

355
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,540
I got to be one, one day".
*applause*

356
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:58,540
Vielen Dank, mit Deinen 'pplaus
(Thank you, with your applause)

357
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,920
Is that how it's called? Is that correct,
the German way?

358
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,520
Vielen Dank, mit Deinen...
(Thank you, with your...)

359
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,860
You said this! *thumbs down"
This means wrong! ... He?

360
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,720
fuer? für? ...
Oh, that's a typical German...

361
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,520
Say "für euren" !!
("for your")

362
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,320
That's a complicated German term!

363
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:34,240
Anyway, thank you so much!
Now, I want to go ... next ... is ... coming

364
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,020
up...

365
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:42,230
is my personal story in connection with
the gated community.

366
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:46,190
I'm sure you received this surprise!
Well connected, and a newcomer in front of

367
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:46,990
you

368
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:54,360
and explaining how gated community affects
us, and now I hope I will try to figure out

369
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:04,850
everything in a beautiful flowered manner
to fix the context and my story together.

370
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:09,490
Can I go next story I don't know IT?

371
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:14,559
Hey, you got to help me, I'm honest,
I don't know...nothing.

372
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,200
What is this?
audience amused

373
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,730
Hey, hey-hey-hey-hey.
Linus, come over please!

374
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:27,870
Fix this damage! Now you are ruining
my speech, what is this?

375
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:30,799
audience amused

376
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,230
This is bullshit, my Italian friend said,
this

377
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,429
is bullshit. Now we... this is, that's the...

378
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:38,660
another problem, they just come here and this
is

379
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,299
what they do, this is bullshit...

380
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:45,059
THIS is not bullshit, this is beautiful!!
audience amused

381
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:50,840
Thank you! That's my beautiful Italian friend,
I don't mean to disrespect the language

382
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,660
but it looks so interested...

383
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:58,590
No no, don't go too high! Leave it to me!
I can control!

384
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,429
Just leave me like "Next, next, next!"
and then I can take care of it,

385
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:08,760
thank you so much! You don't have to do much
work. Free! You're free!

386
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,169
Thanks!

387
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:14,490
I 'came two times a newcomer in my life.

388
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:19,370
The first time I was a newcomer
in my own continent.

389
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:23,910
Next... the neighbor, next to
my country, that's Kenya.

390
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:29,049
I grew up in Kenya. I don't know how it feels

391
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:32,610
when my mom went through all this pain.

392
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:37,020
When she took the five of us – one was
inside.

393
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:43,169
When she took us from the war country,
bringing us to Kayner???

394
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:48,860
And the main reason was my father was
killed, I wasn't lucky to see my father.

395
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:54,130
And 'til that nobody knows who killed him
and where his dead body is.

396
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:58,360
Til now we don't know. But I just wanna say:
"I love you, daddy". I don't know much about

397
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:58,500
you,

398
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,760
but I love you, whereever you are. And rest
in peace!

399
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:09,630
When my mom came to Kenya, she always
told me how hard it was,

400
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,559
but I could not understand! Because I didn't
go

401
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:14,410
through the pain she went through.

402
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:19,480
It's a different story when you have a
feeling about a problem

403
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,340
and you're telling me the story. I don't
have... we can have much connections here.

404
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,580
Of course the connection will be there,
but how you have felt and how you're feeling

405
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,320
is never the way I'm gonna feel! It's just
like

406
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,929
"Oh, sorry, you went through this, poor."

407
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:41,290
"I'm sorry, it's so painful, it's so hard."
It's just difficult. And this is how it is.

408
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:46,750
So we grew up in Kenya, my mom
did everything within her power

409
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:52,419
to give us the best she could
including education.

410
00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:57,290
And the culture I come from,
cultural education is not a priority.

411
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:03,010
But my mom was a complete
woman that was standing

412
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:09,820
for the true meaning of change.
I had the same benefit

413
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,679
and equal respect to my brothers
and thanks to my lovely uncle

414
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,860
who also paid my highschool fees and
everything because mom could not raise

415
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,000
all of us with all of this money because
where I come from in Kenya

416
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,900
is not similar here where education is for
free. You got to pay there highschool.

417
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:30,429
The primary: yes, but highschool you got to
pay. And the schools are not good quality.

418
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:32,640
If you need a good quality school, you got
to

419
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,900
pay for it. You have to make an earning

420
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:42,260
to make this. To call your children very
intelligent and then they have this good life.

421
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:46,190
But luckily enough I'm here in
front of you to at least make

422
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:50,919
some languages that I can communicate
with other people. I learned English

423
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:56,230
and hopefully, next time, I will speak in
Deutsch. No more English Drama,

424
00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:00,000
and I hope I will be confident in my
Deutsch speech because I am not sure...

425
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,799
Deutsch is... I don't know. My Deutsch
somewhat disappeared.

426
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:11,419
But I belive one day – I never lose
my hope – I will come here

427
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:16,090
hopefully, one day. Not here necessarily
but somewhere to speak in Deutsch.

428
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:35,220
And all my speech will be fluent:
"Pa, pa pa pa pa!"

429
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:47,260
No audio 31:19 - 31:56

430
00:31:47,260 --> 00:32:00,280
...and what happened? Polizei flies you
into the jail

431
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,870
or you pay or give me your documents.

432
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:08,720
And it's not a good easy life when you
end in a different country.

433
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,070
You got to accept all the challenges that
you go through. Stand for it,

434
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:17,419
alit, move forward, find a way to
help yourself and others.

435
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:22,059
And then one day you got to be flying
somewhere and be happy at least!

436
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:24,110
Try to be happy.

437
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:30,289
So my mom went through all of
these problems

438
00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:33,830
and I went to school there, everything,
and I worked in a place called Dadaab.

439
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:42,360
Can you identify me from those photos?
You can see somewhere...

440
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,710
I worked like I said before in introduction,
with

441
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,620
different humanitarian international organizations,

442
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:53,169
one of it being "Save the children International",
others being "Terre des hommes".

443
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:58,049
I also worked in Somalia partial time
because I wanted to see what it feels like

444
00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:02,110
to go back home and see my own country.

445
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:05,809
But I don't believe in an own country things,
I believe in a world of no border,

446
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:12,140
get that one right.
*applause*

447
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:17,240
*applause*
Thank you so much!

448
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,270
When I was working in Dadaab, did I ever
knew I will be another newcomer

449
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:27,020
for the second time. I used to feel the
pain that people are going through.

450
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:31,450
All the damages I could see that and
when I was new working there

451
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:35,380
I hardly had lunch because you have
these big UN security staffs

452
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:39,390
and lines and everything is there.
But I could never comfort myself

453
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:43,250
and eat properly because
I could always see mothers

454
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,809
who lost their children on the way.
She had 6 children for example,

455
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:51,150
2 or 3 died on the way. And she
has to move on with her life.

456
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:54,690
And that life was so hard, and I chose

457
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:58,750
to work in the field of child protection.

458
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:03,080
The way I say it some people don't understand
louder, pronounced: CHILD PROTECTION.

459
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,740
Here, you don't know much about it
because the government takes care of it.

460
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:13,000
But this is one of the biggest refugee
camps in the world, Dadaab refugee camp.

461
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,710
And I'm happy, I remember this
memory and I kept it with me

462
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:22,590
because I was not so much into making
the children play with them or this, (?)

463
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:26,940
but I was more of a case manager.
But this was the universal Children's Day.

464
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,340
And I was like I just wanted to make them
happy and it happened I have this memory with

465
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:31,989
me still.

466
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:37,790
Can we give applause for these beautiful kids?
*applause*

467
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,739
*applause*

468
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:45,570
computer "dong" sound

469
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:50,500
I touched in between, sorry sorry, you
told me this. You told me, don't touch.

470
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,250
You know, I told them, the first time they
gave

471
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,899
me this: "You got to show me how to use this,

472
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:57,590
are you stupid or something?"
And he said: "No, just use it"

473
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:01,300
and then the first time I did it he said:
"You see? You said 'I know it',

474
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,430
why did you do the mistake?" And this is
how it goes back to the memory of exams

475
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:09,840
you say this exam was so easy and then you
fail. And the [credit] points you expected

476
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,190
is not there because we just take things so
easy.

477
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,660
So I will not take next time things for easy,

478
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:19,170
I got to be careful.
And this was still part of Dadaab...

479
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,930
audience amused

480
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:27,109
Damn! What's up? Your computer is virus!

481
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:31,109
I have a beautiful laptop there. Get mine!

482
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:34,190
Helper: What for?

483
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:38,320
Fatuma: Okay. Gut! Thank you.

484
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,990
And these beautiful ladies there... we were
doing a lot of different

485
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,540
work with children. I was more in the case
management and

486
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,780
dealing with child abuse, neglect, exploitation
and violence.

487
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,720
There are a lot of children who are sexually
abused

488
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,840
and you got to stand there for them, take
them through the process

489
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,270
because the parents are psychologically
traumatized. They have no energy at

490
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:07,619
all whatsoever. To do anything. And this is
what's called girl child empowerment.

491
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:15,280
I tried for my own level with my colleagues
and everybody. To help the girls

492
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:21,040
speak out and say something. Because
if their voice is not heard,

493
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,410
nobody will make them raise their full voice.
(?) Because voice is power.

494
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:29,700
Voice is the key change to everything.

495
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,090
And these girls were always shy I remember
them putting... hides face you see her hand

496
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,300
was already there.

497
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:39,980
They do this... my cloth is far... (?) They're
so shy and they can't say much.

498
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:45,710
And it's not their fault. It's what's called
culture setup.

499
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,960
This is how we were brought up. As a woman.

500
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:56,660
This how we behave. But I disagree.

501
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:02,720
Everybody should be equal. Everybody should
have equal freedom.

502
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,590
Of speech, of saying whatever they feel like,
letting it out.

503
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:11,550
Respect it. Be part of their change process.

504
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:18,800
Because these are expected to be the leaders
of tomorrow, today.

505
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,340
But if we don't empower them if we don't support
them

506
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,060
they're not going to be anything.

507
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:34,940
[In my case] It's hardly to see. From-the-culture-I-come-from-woman
standing in front of

508
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:39,349
the majority-dominance-men here. Hackers,
hehe and women.

509
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:42,090
And speak to them. It's something rare because

510
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:47,050
this is not how we are brought up. You got
to be shy, sitting somewhere.

511
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:50,670
Not speaking here like notorious, this is
not a good woman.

512
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:55,490
Standing in front of men and talking you're
not a good woman. This is what it is.

513
00:37:55,490 --> 00:38:04,260
But I say that good women should be standing
in front of people and speaking up.

514
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:09,609
*applause*

515
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:13,590
Thank you so much. There're a lot of problems.
That I saw.

516
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:18,070
I want to give a comparison between what I
saw in Dadaab and here.

517
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:22,460
But sometimes it's hard to give the comparison
because I was working there

518
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:26,130
earning my own money and doing my own stuffs.
But now here I am

519
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:32,650
and opposite. Somebody has to work for me
and help me.

520
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:40,760
But generally some of the key problems that
were there in Dadaab refugee camp: education.

521
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,800
Education was a key problem.

522
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,820
Girl child education was a key problem
as well. There were highschools,

523
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:51,720
there were over 40 international
humanitarian organizations

524
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,390
and some of them were responsible
for education. But you know they

525
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,820
can't do everything, they don't have
support from the government.

526
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:04,609
And there was a lot of... poor
educational infrastructure.

527
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:10,160
There was no clear support in erms of
education. There were no class rooms.

528
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,599
There were not enough teachers. The
resources was completely not enough.

529
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:18,730
And these people there was
restrictions of freedom.

530
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:23,880
People could not cross the normal way to
go to the cities or other part of Kenya.

531
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,349
They were restricted in that Dadaab
zone. If you wanna go out of Dadaab

532
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:32,290
you gotta ask for permission.
Go to the UNHCR,

533
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:36,940
ask for permission to go out and
state why you wanna go there,

534
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,470
outside of this camp. So it was not easy.

535
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:43,950
It's similar to here some months
ago, in our country here.

536
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:48,950
We were not allowed to travel out of – like
I come from the beautiful Brandenburg.

537
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:54,190
You're not allowed to travel
outside Brandenburg.

538
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:57,869
But then so much to the leaders now
they're making a change.

539
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:02,520
And they're trying something at least.
It's not perfect. But they're trying.

540
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,240
Can we give a round of applause to
our leaders who're at least trying,

541
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:12,099
I like to appeciate those who are even
trying. Can we give applause, please?

542
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:13,830
*applause*

543
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:20,720
helper approaching speaker's desk

544
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,010
Sorry, Linus! I'm so sorry.

545
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,470
I think the mistake comes from here!
Just to stand there...

546
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:33,480
No, this is not the mistake. Okay, cool.

547
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,960
I know, in every country there
are a lot of newcomers

548
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,060
and similar problems are there. But one
good things I discovered from Dadaab

549
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,930
is that the people are still within their
culture. At least they are within a language

550
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:50,859
they can understand. Basically
things they're used to.

551
00:40:50,859 --> 00:40:54,280
But here you come – it's completely
the opposite. So what leads

552
00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:03,210
to these big refugee camps? It's poor
management of responsibility.

553
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,900
If the developed world would
support the developing world

554
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:11,070
and the problems they went through I don't
think we would have been in the direction

555
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:18,690
we are right now.
I just wanna go back a little bit to History.

556
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,580
When colonisation was happening
in this developing world

557
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:28,990
no person was asked why they
came to those countries.

558
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,530
Nobody asked them [about their] permission
to

559
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,530
get in. They didn't ask anybody permissions

560
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:38,200
to get in. Now my big question is: Now that
we need the help of the developed world

561
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,650
why are we called "Illegals" – number one.
Why are we called

562
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:49,300
you need to come in with a permission.
Why?? The permission on us

563
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:54,680
and YOU never asked for permissions before!
Ever! Why?

564
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,820
*applause*

565
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,109
Thank you.

566
00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:08,800
These are the good examples
of gated community.

567
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,720
Sorry.

568
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:20,890
If leaders would forget about the
past because what your parents or

569
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:25,440
your leaders did in the past you don't
have to do and repeat the same mistake.

570
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:32,250
You need to correct that mistake.
And make a difference.

571
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:36,380
*applause*

572
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:42,910
We are not perfect in any way. And I
always call politics is a dirty game.

573
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:47,670
But I want to send a message to all the
politicians and leaders in the world.

574
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:53,800
Please... stand... for human rights

575
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:58,770
and respect it!
Don't put your political interest first,

576
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:07,730
put the human life first! Then the
rest becomes number two!

577
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:12,720
*applause*

578
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,550
Thank you.

579
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,820
I love this woman called Claudia Roth.
I had a panel discussions

580
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:23,690
once with her in re:publica.
And I loved her approach.

581
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:30,099
She's at least a very mentoring woman.
She's a role model to me.

582
00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:33,349
And I remember her telling me one time,
I said thanks to the German government,

583
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:38,869
"at least they're trying to do something".
And she told me: "No no no no no no no no!"

584
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:41,609
And I was like: "What?" – "Don't say
'Thank you'! What for? Haa?"

585
00:43:41,609 --> 00:43:45,240
And I was like: "Yeah, at least they did
something! At least they give us a shelter,

586
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,660
somewhere to sleep, something to eat!" For
me, I would grate that. When if everything's

587
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:54,359
not perfect, I will say to that little thing
"thank you". And something very imoportant.

588
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:59,160
But thanks to Claudia Roth and her team,
they're really trying to do a beautiful job.

589
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,869
And the rest of the leaders whatever they
are,

590
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:04,700
not only them, everyone who's doing nice job.

591
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:09,800
So that was the life in Dadaab.
It's very tough and hard.

592
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:16,050
I came to German'. And I was in
Eisenhuttenstadt first time.

593
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:21,500
And life is so hard and horrible.

594
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,800
I can tell you here all of this in
words. But believe me,

595
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,830
you can never understand unless
you're in that situation yourself.

596
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:35,260
You can not understand.
The rest is just a story.

597
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:39,430
You will just say: "OK, oh sorry it's
a painful pro... oh sorry, yeah,

598
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:43,640
I understand." – No, you're lying, you're
not understanding. Be in that condition

599
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,970
and then you got to tell me what it is.

600
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:53,260
There's a lot of health problems.
The people are overcrowded,

601
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:58,330
There're a lot of outbreak of
diseases at different times.

602
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:02,920
And people are congested in
containers and in other

603
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:08,869
not-deserving human shelter areas.
I understand them on one side

604
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:11,270
but on one side I refuse
to understand them.

605
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:16,089
I mean this is a very well developed
countries. Not only I don't point fingers

606
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:16,650
only,

607
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:20,080
because I wanna avoid pointing fingers on
specific countries because this problem

608
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,339
is a global concerned problem. Gated
communities everywhere in the world

609
00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:28,470
and it's not only here in
German', it's everywhere!

610
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:32,460
So this message I'm sending
is going to everywhere.

611
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,420
And I remember, in Eisenhüttenstadt,

612
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:42,530
you're put in 5..10 people... 20 people
– not 20, I don't wanna lie –

613
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:46,770
but at least 10 people could be in one room.

614
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:49,700
And you can't say anything about ist.
You're from different country. We don't

615
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:53,190
understand each other culture-wise, language-
wise, everything. But you still are forced

616
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:57,349
to live together. There is no freedom
of education like I wanted,

617
00:45:57,349 --> 00:45:59,990
to further my education. There is nothing
like

618
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:02,440
that. The bureaucratic is another story.

619
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,980
Leave it aside. But so complicated that
you can't be who you wanna be!

620
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,900
And my question was all the time: When this
difficult condition where you're not allowed

621
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,790
to work, you're not allowed to go to school,
you're not allowed to function like a

622
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:19,320
normal human being! You're not even
allowed to go out and visit Berlin,

623
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:23,520
the first time you are...
I asked myself is this a perfect Welcome

624
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:29,859
in German'? Keep in isolated, damage,
and not giving us

625
00:46:29,859 --> 00:46:33,220
the freedom to move out and see
people. Everybody is like this:

626
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:36,150
tired, sad: "You go to the office, you ask..."
Not everybody! Some people.

627
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:39,910
I remember the first time I visited
there, I went to a woman and I said:

628
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:45,200
"Is this true? Is this where I am? Is this
really true? Is this happening to me?"

629
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,660
I was like: "In a moment I don't
know where the hell I was!"

630
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:52,430
I thought my life was over!
– No, it wasn't over,

631
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:56,369
it was the beginning.

632
00:46:56,369 --> 00:47:00,230
And I asked her – Thank you –
and I asked her

633
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:04,500
"What's going on? Can I go out?" And she
said: "Was??" – "Do you speak English?"

634
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,000
–

635
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,060
"Was?? Deutsch, bitte!" And I was
like: "I can't speak Deutsch!" -

636
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:13,130
"Was?? Raus, bitte, nächst'..."
– "Can I please have a permission

637
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,490
to go out at least see the city or
something, because I'm not having

638
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:20,320
a contact with my family, no relation
whatsoever, I'm really dying

639
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,349
of trauma here!" – "Was?? Raus, bitte!
Nächst', nächst' bitte! Nächst'!"

640
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:29,570
You have no choice! You have
no voice! You got to leave!

641
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:37,869
That was some of the difficult
moments I remember.

642
00:47:37,869 --> 00:47:42,369
But there were also nice people in the same
Eisenhüttenstadt. Working as a social worker.

643
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:46,820
Very kind generous and very supporting.

644
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:50,990
But all of a sudden life wasn't easy
basically. I remember there was

645
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:54,599
this small internet area I don't think
it's their fault that's the only space

646
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:59,280
they were given. Refugee inspection (?)
where you can just go and google something.

647
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,829
And I would like to ask everybody in the
audience to give them a big 'pplause

648
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:08,040
because they're doing
a beautiful job there.

649
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,700
*applause*

650
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:20,700
Thanks. So the life in Eisenhüttenstadt
was completely a very...

651
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:28,130
problem with slides projection

652
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:33,700
helper approaching again

653
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:39,670
Yes, so out of my transfer
in Brandenburg,

654
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:44,079
still in Brandenburg I went to...
Life wasn't easy and blabla...

655
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,859
everybody knows how hard it is and
not everybody can understand this.

656
00:48:47,859 --> 00:48:51,550
I went transfered after 2 months or 3 months
of... When you are new in German'

657
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:55,890
you're transfered to another refugee camp.
Then I was in Bestensee.

658
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:58,369
And I was asking myself: Back
home I was somebody,

659
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:03,630
I had my own dog, I had my own little
money, I had my own life beautiful.

660
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:08,480
Here you come you're nothing! I wanted
to find a way I could help myself

661
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,540
get out of this terrible situation. Put myself
at least somehow at distance (?) out of it,

662
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:17,650
then help others get out of it.
And then I asked the manager

663
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:22,550
how I can help the community and I was
an English assistant teacher in this area.

664
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:26,670
The beautiful teachers were very supportive,
many of them could not speak English.

665
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:30,760
But the beautiful heart was there. So
kind, so generous. Very supporting

666
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:35,839
and loving! I could not ask more.
They were so kind and nice.

667
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:39,240
Can we give them a big round of applause,
to my beautiful teachers!?

668
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:45,089
*applause*
If you don't mind!

669
00:49:45,089 --> 00:49:49,599
And I encountered a lot of problems while
I was working in the school because

670
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:52,040
if you work there they said the socials said
(?)

671
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,000
the school wanted to pay me

672
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,880
but the socials said "No, we can't."
And the socials said,

673
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,560
I can only work 1 hour 1 Euro.

674
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,329
A whole hour you are paid 1 Euro,
Schilling...

675
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:08,190
Do you understand the meaning of 1 Euro!?
Can somebody give me 1 Euro?

676
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:12,510
Each one of you give me 1 Euro.
And then we see how much it is.

677
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,930
Smiling amused

678
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:18,760
So this was... But they made it a difference
and they said: "We wanna have you

679
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,740
and do everything possible within our power
to

680
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:23,150
support you. Because you are supporting us."

681
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:26,760
Because, I wanted to do something useful
with my life because in the refugee camps

682
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,740
all that we do is either drink, fight...
It's not our choice.

683
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:35,450
That's where we are put in. We're so much
isolated and outside of the community.

684
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:39,750
The community is completely gated.
And then we are put in a very complete

685
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:44,130
isolation situation. We need to stand up
together and make a difference

686
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:48,480
by breaking these gated community. Each and
every individual of us, we have to.

687
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:55,000
And find a way to.
*applause*

688
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:01,270
Thank you, Vielen Dank!

689
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:04,400
And then, well I was in Bestensee.
This place is called Bestensee,

690
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,400
some of you might come from here
I don't know. I was also part of a...

691
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:15,960
a sport club because I love sports.
And I remember them giving me...

692
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,140
Nee... Nooo!

693
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:26,099
I'm sometimes Clown so that's why
sometimes I behave like this. chuckles

694
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:30,410
This was a beautiful picture from
their T-Shirt and the sports club,

695
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:34,320
they bought me. And... "you are nobody you
have nobody but somebody's there for you

696
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:40,410
loving you supporting you and doing
everything for you." I was so lucky.

697
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:43,320
And I wanted to do something for
the community. And I was like:

698
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,400
"What can I do to help people?" And the
children I used to love wherever they're

699
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,329
in the world. And these are some of the things...
10 minutes left sign – Thank you –

700
00:51:50,329 --> 00:51:53,960
...these are some of the things I was
trying to do just to escape from stress.

701
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,940
I didn't wanna drink, I didn't wanna do bad
things. I just wanted progress with my life.

702
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,740
And these are some of the things I tried to
do.

703
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:05,660
chuckles on next slide

704
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:09,310
So please let us get used to
the name newcomers,

705
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:14,369
not refugees. And these were my
beautiful communities I was doing twice

706
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:17,589
in the whole of German'. And if you want
to invite me in some of the cities

707
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:22,770
I have never seen, do that
and give me one bread and

708
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:26,369
I was... I'm basically an international speaker
and I have been going to different places

709
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:30,380
talking to the people and trying to give
them some hope together with the support

710
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,880
as there are a lot of nice people in Deutschland,
for example. I can talk about German',

711
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,119
not elsewhere. There are a lot of nice people
who wanna do something but they don't know

712
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:38,550
how.

713
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:40,160
So I don't like to generalize. And for those
of

714
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,349
us who are defined as racists I don't belive

715
00:52:43,349 --> 00:52:45,570
in the word racism. I think it's about lack
of

716
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:47,670
information. When people understand

717
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:51,630
who we are where we come from and
what problems we went through

718
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:55,940
I think they will be kind, nice and generous.
To understand us and support us.

719
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:59,440
So if we continued that those people
who discriminate us and that then

720
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,440
we discriminate them I don't think we
are going anywhere. The best way...

721
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,839
If a killer kills and then you kill this is
not the best way to move forward.

722
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:12,020
It's about trying to figure out how best
can we try to make both sides together

723
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:16,400
and I'm doing a project called, a program
called "United Action". And the idea behind

724
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:16,490
is

725
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:20,510
visiting refugee camps, creating events,
bringing the community

726
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:25,530
and the newcomers together because
I don't wanna only say: "Support us,

727
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:29,930
newcomers, newcomers." There are
people in the community who are vulnerable,

728
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:33,820
who are poor and they need help. And
that's the reason why they don't want us.

729
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,970
They feel jealous and it's their right. I
mean

730
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:38,210
they're human beings, they're not perfect.

731
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:42,140
So we got to find a way to fit both
sides together, to come together.

732
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:46,640
And support each other. And that's my
idea behind "United Action". I believe

733
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,589
when we all of us come together,
do things together, eat together,

734
00:53:50,589 --> 00:53:59,960
the rest of the bridge will just slowly
fall down, like the "Berliner" Wall.

735
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,790
*applause*

736
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:04,800
Thank you!
*applause*

737
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:10,240
This one of the photos when I was in
Neuhardenberg. And these are

738
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:14,220
part of the friends that were helping
me going there taking food and drinks

739
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:18,339
and stuffs and just having a good time
with the people. And trying to figure out

740
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:22,720
what we could do together. I have a
Facebook page called... I don't want this

741
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,079
keynote speech to be my
own advertising thing,

742
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,050
but I just wanna give you more information
about myself so that you know

743
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:33,950
who you're talking to and if you
need more questions or you have

744
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:39,089
anything to tell me you better
meet me outside later with 1 Euro.

745
00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:40,680
audience chuckling

746
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:47,030
Joking, don't give me any Cent!

747
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:51,260
And these are still some of the events
and I love being happy. I mean

748
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:55,310
happiness is my family. And hope
is my family. Without losing hope

749
00:54:55,310 --> 00:55:00,700
and happiness we can be somewhere.

750
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:04,030
And this was still Neuhardenberg with
the team and we were doing a wonderful

751
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:10,520
amazing thing. This was a group I've been
supporting and they won some awards.

752
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:16,359
And this is my beautiful visit to
the beautiful German parliament

753
00:55:16,359 --> 00:55:20,550
with my Coca Cola.

754
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:25,849
Please! Stand for Change! Please

755
00:55:25,849 --> 00:55:31,349
call us our names or any other beautiful
name or our personal names!

756
00:55:31,349 --> 00:55:35,700
And we got to find a way to figure
out how best we can call each other.

757
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,040
We don't have to call ourselves Refugees
anymore. Because this word

758
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:43,200
has been used in the wrong way. We
are meant to be very vulnerable.

759
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,819
We are meant to be nothing! We are
somebody just like anyone of you!

760
00:55:46,819 --> 00:55:50,319
We only lost our home and family.
We are human beings

761
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:54,430
just like anyone of you! We can do
something. Don't look at the word!

762
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:58,020
Look at us as a human being. As a person,
as somebody in a capable position

763
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:12,250
to do something. Don't you believe we
are human beings? Then get rid of this name!

764
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,730
*applause*

765
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:19,109
Thank you!
Situations should never define us.

766
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:23,800
What should define us is
the name "human being".

767
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,390
And the respect we label to each other.

768
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:33,750
And I would like to send a message to the
world: These Gated Community issues

769
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:37,980
is a global issue.
Please let us try to promote

770
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:43,730
Peace, Love, Unity. Break
the isolation. Come together!

771
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:48,400
Support each other! Love each other!
Love each other! Love each other

772
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,819
and love each other again!
And be there whatever possible.

773
00:56:52,819 --> 00:56:57,089
I can't say more words than
this, I just wanna say:

774
00:56:57,089 --> 00:57:00,589
Thank you so much to everyone of
you. And I want you to go home...

775
00:57:00,589 --> 00:57:04,349
Not you, you are the wrong audience,
I think. You know what's you doing already.

776
00:57:04,349 --> 00:57:08,530
Thank you so much to that! But for those of
us who don't know what Gated Community

777
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:14,220
means and how we can break the
silence: take the responsibility,

778
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:20,140
go out, do a lot of awareness campaign
and find a way to kill and delete

779
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:25,720
this gate. Let us open the gate
with open arms for everybody

780
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:31,240
regardless of who you are. Let us stand
with one name as human beings.

781
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:36,640
Don't believe in the name of a nationality.
Don't believe in the name of stupid colors,

782
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:41,369
always respect the human dignity.
"Don't lose hope in the name of humanity!"

783
00:57:41,369 --> 00:57:45,670
This was a word Linus [Neumann] told me
several times and I loved it and that's why

784
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,780
I wanna say it right now with you all.
And...

785
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:52,760
the first question says: "If you
were me what would you do?"

786
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,500
Imagine, you are this.

787
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:57,849
Pointing at someone in audience front row
What would you do?

788
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,540
I don't know, it's a decision you're making,
answer belongs to you.

789
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,220
"What would you wish from the Hacker community?"

790
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:06,210
What I wish from the Hacker community
is that you're doing a great job.

791
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:09,800
Keep the good work. Give us more internet,
in the Heims, we don't have this.

792
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:15,440
Do this for us everywhere
in Germany, everywhere!

793
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,359
*applause*

794
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:23,800
Please visit all the refugee camps
next to you, whereever you live!

795
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,470
Find a way you can make a difference
by helping these camps and

796
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:31,140
some of the excuses that politicians
use why they don't give internet

797
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,060
to us is: They said we
might watch Porno.

798
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:33,180
shouting:
Whoo hooo!

799
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:39,310
What a stupid excuse!! Shame!!
Shame Shame Shame Shame Shame!!

800
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:49,349
Thank you so much, everybody! I will be here
for 4 days, I will be having 2 workshops

801
00:58:49,349 --> 00:58:52,250

kindly let us make together and

802
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:57,140

everybody enjoyed the speech

803
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:01,420
and no more words to say! Just say again
Thank you and Thank you to the Angels

804
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:07,589
Thanks to all the people who are trying
to do this beautiful congress as successful.

805
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:11,000
Stay Peace and I wanna be the first person
– I don't know if I'm the first person –

806
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,790
I wanna say "Happy New Year!". Maybe we don't
know each other and we hopefully will meet

807
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:15,089
again.

808
00:59:15,089 --> 00:59:19,599
Happy New Year to all of you.
Big love! Be Peace and Unity!

809
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,420
