1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,345
*intro music*

2
00:00:10,765 --> 00:00:13,810
Herald-Angel: So, welcome here on stage

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,260
bonsoir taziden and kload

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,400
the next talk is on

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,250
building a better internet

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,610
It all started I think

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,220
two years ago at the 30C3

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,570
when these two guys were here

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,300
inviting us to build our own ISP

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,250
and this year they want to invite us to

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,320
build something like a better internet

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,640
which is a small box I think
they have brought with them.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,880
Yeah, that prevents your ISP from

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,190
snooping on your traffic and

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,420
enables you to circumvent things like

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,510
carrier grade NAT

17
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,450
and all of these oddites

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,130
Stage is yours

19
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,790
kload + taziden: Thank you

20
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:57,810
applause

21
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,989
taziden: Hello everyone, so we are
going to talk to you about

22
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,590
the internet cube, which is this little box
you can see here

23
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,430
maybe you have heard already

24
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,860
about this project with the french name

25
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,799
“La brique Internet”,

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,930
but today we are going to stick with

27
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,040
the internet cube.

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,479
So let's start with some facts

29
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,799
kload: today we have an Internet
made of big silos

30
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,439
and this is really something

31
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,000
we're incomfortable with

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,850
and really something we need to change.

33
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,500
We have… We give information to

34
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,700
a lot of companies, a lot of entities,

35
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,509
governments and stuff that

36
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,950
are having this power to

37
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,420
influence us through this.

38
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,869
So, yeah, it is to say that

39
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:46,829
we have this princess freedom

40
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,110
we can say that is being held by

41
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:56,439
some evelish Ganondorf

42
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:01,080
Like you know that Google, Amazon, Netflix,

43
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:10,049
Apple, Microsoft, Dropbox, Nasty one, Onclick,

44
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:13,189
doubleclick.google.ceobase.com
or something like this

45
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:14,919
and reddit, obviously

46
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:18,169
and facebook, that's for sure

47
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:20,329
fact number 2, maybe

48
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:25,430
t: fact number 2: internet needs diversity

49
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,569
internet is today as kload said

50
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:32,499
the information is centered in silos

51
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:34,489
but not only personal information

52
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:36,299
also the public information

53
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:37,579
and we can have today

54
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:38,870
what is your freedom

55
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,230
if the only information you get is from

56
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,980
the top hundread websites

57
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,180
so that's a major problem.

58
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,569
We need more networks,

59
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:47,419
we need more websites,

60
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:49,389
we need more information, more sources,

61
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:51,969
more diversity and obviously

62
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:54,369
we need more networks.

63
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:55,590
k: Thankfully we have this

64
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,629
hypertext link to the rescue

65
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:00,389
of the princess here and

66
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,930
he seems a bit sad with only his shield

67
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,230
so he has to find this artifacts to get

68
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,459
to this old man in the cave and find

69
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,139
I don't know maybe something

70
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:17,519
maybe an internet cube

71
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:22,299
*applause*

72
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:27,919
Okay, okay, this way is a bit tough.

73
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,370
We have one here and

74
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,589
without further ado,

75
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:34,199
we'll make a quick demo

76
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,079
so that you have an idea how it works

77
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:39,009
t: so let's see we have one here
connected on the video

78
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:41,629
k: we just plugged in just before the conference

79
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:45,589
so that we can show the [???] at some point

80
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:48,079
t: let's see what's on there

81
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,059
k: just have to type my domain name,

82
00:03:50,059 --> 00:03:52,172
a very common one

83
00:03:54,242 --> 00:03:56,150
t: yea, it works.

84
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,129
*applause*

85
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:03,389
this is where it works,

86
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:05,889
a device like this

87
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:10,759
and yeah, I just have my
awesome website on it

88
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:15,359
I can just have my e-mails,

89
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,889
I mean receive my e-mails.

90
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:20,889
Yeah, I guess, I hope.

91
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:24,050
So you can actually send me e-mails on it.

92
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,099
k: let's encrypt is not yet included,

93
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:29,449
but we're working on it.

94
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:31,300
t: It is self signed certificates

95
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,619
but propper ciphers and stuff.

96
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:38,949
Don't worry.

97
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:45,509
k: You really accept it permanently?

98
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:47,740
t: I didn't.

99
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,569
So. It is running on the 4G connection here

100
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:55,810
because I don't know the CCC Network

101
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,150
is kind of spoofing things sometimes

102
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,659
and I will try to receive my e-mails here.

103
00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:10,860
Don't move to much, he's working here.

104
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,409
k: awww, come on

105
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:19,139
t: Please, Please 4G.

106
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,900
Oh. That's something.

107
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,680
k: The packets are going through

108
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,110
europe and belgium, france also of course

109
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:44,660
t: That's because HTTPS is slowing up connections

110
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,000
Maybe we won't have e-mails, but I still have

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,120
my awesome website on it.

112
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,770
Oh, yes! It works!

113
00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:00,789
Sorry about that.

114
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:08,169
Yeah!
*applause*

115
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:13,080
k: Can you remember the password?

116
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,979
t: I did. Something very strong.

117
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,460
Do you have something funny to say?

118
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:35,770
k: No. Not after the
talk I gave yesterday, no, sorry.

119
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,830
So, how are you today?

120
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,259
You're doing right?

121
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:43,789
t: Maybe you can explain that

122
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:47,419
k: we just plugged it in.

123
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:55,110
We even put this 4G phone in USB

124
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,050
connected it through USB to the cube

125
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,689
and it worked.

126
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:04,219
It recognised an internet device on

127
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:09,229
the USB-device and automatically connected

128
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,439
it to the internet.

129
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,840
This is kind of a plug-and-play thing.

130
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,379
t: Actually we can explain that we switched

131
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:20,879
to 3G connection because we had issues

132
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,789
during the preperation with the networks here

133
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:26,699
at the congress. Some people where trying

134
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:29,209
to spoof certificates.

135
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:34,369
k: DynDNS or SSL-Certificates, what an idea

136
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,039
t: let's wait a little bit

137
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:40,840
(whispers) Come on!

138
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,150
*chuckles*

139
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,029
that was working earlier.

140
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:49,620
t: of course it was working

141
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,599
Okay, maybe, what we can say about this,

142
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,519
don't try this at home because it's dangerous.

143
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,449
No, it’s … I mean …

144
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:01,949
Receiving e-mails, actual e-mails
on a 3G connected device.

145
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,579
That can be tricky at some point.

146
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:12,399
Okay, we can go further now and
just get back to it afterwards.

147
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,030
So, the question is:

148
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,200
How does it actually work?

149
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,779
t: … when it works. *chuckles*

150
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:24,289
t: How does it work?
That's the interesting part.

151
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:27,900
This little box, cube,
what is interesting about this

152
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,279
is that it's the union of three mayor

153
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,279
essential parts: three basic elements that

154
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,299
combine together gives something

155
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,169
very interesting and

156
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:43,149
the first part is open hardware.

157
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:48,260
We need to do this to achieve
what we are describing.

158
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,000
We need to have an open hardware that is cheap,

159
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,480
low voltage, that is hackable,

160
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,839
with specifications online and so far

161
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:01,340
the best match we had only makes Hamboard,

162
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:07,380
but open hardware is just one element and

163
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,050
you need to have free software
running on top

164
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,529
of this open hardware and that's something

165
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:15,550
kload has been working on
for a long time now

166
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,930
k: for like 3 years we worked on a software

167
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,209
called YunoHost which is basically

168
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:26,029
a Debian based distribution that aims

169
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:29,310
to facilitate or to ease the installation

170
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,529
and the management, the handling

171
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,859
of services on the server

172
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:38,649
easing the user creation, management,

173
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:41,290
the backup creation, the domain creation

174
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,290
the extention of the server capabilities

175
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,570
with applications and stuff.

176
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:50,430
So that's regarding the software part.

177
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,060
You can find further information on the website

178
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,190
YunoHost.org and we had those 2 components

179
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:03,929
cool hardware, open and

180
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:07,990
olimex is quite a cool manufacturer

181
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,430
and we had this software which works on

182
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,820
that board but we needed something

183
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,829
in order to solve this network issue

184
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:20,529
that obviously is a pain in the ass when you

185
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:24,170
are trying to host yourself.

186
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:28,259
It's like how can I make my server open

187
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:34,050
on the internet and that's
how the third component comes up.

188
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,880
We need, actually …

189
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,509
We chose to add to this a VPN connection

190
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:45,139
to a trustworthy provider.

191
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:47,920
t: Two years ago I was here at the congress

192
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,800
giving a talk about inviting you to build

193
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,040
your own ISPs and when you are running

194
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,329
such ISPs you should communicate and

195
00:10:56,329 --> 00:11:00,899
help each other in order
for the networks to grow

196
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:06,730
and this networks to have them
everywhere, actually.

197
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,410
We met with Freifunk and so.

198
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,790
That was really great and we at the time

199
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,300
presented a tool called db.ffdn.org

200
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,630
and you can find on this site a whole bunch

201
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,600
of internet access providers,

202
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,350
non-profit ones, that are enabling us

203
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,300
with this cube to provide VPN access with

204
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,720
public endpoints which means you can have

205
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,389
your personal data or your public data
accessible through the Internet

206
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:39,270
through trusted connection,

207
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,659
going through a friendly ISP

208
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,670
and that's something that's not possible

209
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,920
with the most of the commercial ISPs

210
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,309
that are blocking port 25,

211
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:50,620
that are doing silly stuff,

212
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,169
that are doing discrimination on the network

213
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:56,779
and that do not want us to do self hosting.

214
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:00,850
That's the 3rd element that I've seen

215
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,030
missing in most of the projects about

216
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,360
this kind of matter.

217
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,970
It's how do you …

218
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,519
You can trust the hardware,

219
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,779
you can work on the hardware,

220
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:10,949
you can work on the software,

221
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:13,860
but the missing link is always, I think,

222
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,000
the third is one about the connection
to the Internet.

223
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,569
Combined together this

224
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:22,660
3 elements give what we think is

225
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,970
kind of only trinity like

226
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,120
and it makes the internet cube.

227
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,639
k: those 3 parts are very legit in the

228
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:35,110
sense that it now comes as a plug and play

229
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,930
device, something really plug and play

230
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,090
even though it is a bit slow sometimes but…

231
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,930
t: depends on the network

232
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,120
k: depends on the network, but this question

233
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,690
of having friendly ISPs is
really complicated to solve.

234
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,779
Self hosting is becoming
really complicated.

235
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:55,310
Now having this 3 parts

236
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,069
really makes the cube plug and play

237
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,800
and the cool part is adding a WiFi antenna

238
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,640
on it and you have actually this initial

239
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,430
network broadcasted through all your house,

240
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,000
every place you go you have this wifi,

241
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,190
we have one though, we have a

242
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:25,300
non-discriminant network being
broadcasted as they all say, they have WiFi.

243
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,029
t: it's overrated

244
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:33,170
k: We have also this possibilities to

245
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,190
broadcast a virtual network at home

246
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,279
and just by connecting to it

247
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,920
your commercial non-trustworthy ISP

248
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,499
is not able to read what you are doing
off your connection anymore.

249
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,440
There is those very 2 parts

250
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,379
having a virtual network at home

251
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:55,250
and having a personal cell
working right away

252
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:00,339
t: that's the very interesting thing
about all this

253
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,129
is that you have two major parts like

254
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:05,839
connecting to the cube and your data

255
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,440
from everywhere on the internet

256
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,470
and also at your home, or whereever

257
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,509
you are you can connect to the internet

258
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:15,529
through a trusted channel and

259
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:17,459
of course this is what we came up with

260
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:20,249
but I think there are many, many

261
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:23,529
other things we can do and maybe

262
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,680
you are all wondering how do you get one?

263
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,740
a working one of course

264
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,430
and that's an interesting question

265
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,730
it's easy for French people or

266
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,849
Belgian to have one because there are

267
00:14:37,849 --> 00:14:40,649
non profit local ISPs providing this cubes

268
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:47,180
nearby that as I say

269
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,830
the local part is very important

270
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,009
what you should do is maybe think about

271
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:55,579
building your own ISP providing VPN access

272
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:59,609
such as we do and also all the parts,

273
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:02,000
all the documentation,
all the software and so on

274
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,650
is online and we really invite people
to build their own.

275
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,329
If you have questions about building your
own ISP and providing

276
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:13,740
public IPs to friends and
to people around you,

277
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,730
ask us, we can help you

278
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,090
It's really what we want to do.
It's really to have more networks,

279
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,910
to have more projects like this

280
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,129
t: the thing that we often miss here is that

281
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:27,920
it is not as difficult as we think to build

282
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,229
an actual VPN provider.

283
00:15:32,229 --> 00:15:36,279
We've done it a lot in France,

284
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:39,060
we've done quite, I don't know

285
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,779
how many members are in the federation?

286
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:43,960
k: in the federation,
we have a federation of

287
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,749
non-profit internet access providers
and I think

288
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:49,370
like 2 years ago we where like 21 and now

289
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,329
we have 28 organisations

290
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:54,680
t: 28 non-profit organisations made by

291
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,370
just passionists over France so

292
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,480
we have knowledges of how we can

293
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,470
build one and if you want to do so just

294
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,120
k: just ask us

295
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,750
t: We have gathered enough knowledge to

296
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,439
help you bootstrap something.

297
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:12,500
k: one thing is:
before the internet cube project

298
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,709
came up, we were not so much interested in

299
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:20,319
building VPN service.
It really came up like this with

300
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:23,100
people from the YunoHost project

301
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,199
with the Olimex hardware we discovered

302
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,720
with the people involved
in the non-profit ISPs

303
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,550
and this very combination gives something

304
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:37,609
that I think is very, very cool
and very inspiring.

305
00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:40,720
There are many things to do with it

306
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,599
many hacks to invent or things to …

307
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:47,240
t: Of course, this hardware is kind of

308
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:53,019
like a Rasberry Pi, it has potentially …
all of the potential

309
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,599
You can do domadig [?] with it.

310
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,890
We have made pirate boxes quite often,

311
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:02,509
maybe if you went to camp you
probably have seen me going around

312
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:05,099
with a big ad sign and this actually on

313
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:08,760
my head because I was sharing documents.

314
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,240
k: You also did it in Tunisia?

315
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,450
t: Yeah, in Tunisia, too.
We did it quite a few times

316
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,520
The thing is: you can build piratebox,

317
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,349
you can as a router, a wifi router,

318
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:25,569
you can imagine having some kind of

319
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:29,630
tor gateway, maybe one day routing all

320
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,970
the traffic instead of VPN
routing it through tor.

321
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,910
This is something we can
imagine with the …

322
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,610
k: with people using it
as a way to stream radio

323
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,120
from the place

324
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,430
t: Yea, as a streaming device...

325
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,680
k: It's one interesting thing
that there is a

326
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,230
battery, so you can just... really

327
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,810
have it on your backpack.
You can recharge it

328
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,520
with a solar panel as it's low voltage and

329
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,410
it's really something interesting and

330
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:01,520
we came up with this by tinkering.
We hope that

331
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,630
we will ... you will advance
other things to do

332
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,190
over creative, stupid, crazy ideas

333
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,270
and that's why we are here. So...

334
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,530
t: Yeah, if you want to have
more information though

335
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,500
you have this... this is
actually our domain.

336
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,780
That you figured out.

337
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,670
It's like "internetcube.be"

338
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,940
and you have all the information

339
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:28,010
all the documentation, mailing list, IRC,
every channel of communication

340
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,880
k: Yeah, you can contact us
to share actions

341
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,900
to see what can be improved,

342
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:38,660
because for us it fits in our use cases,

343
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,070
but it may be that there are other use cases

344
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,150
with when you are in Tunisia or other countries,

345
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,140
there are certainly other things
to do with it.

346
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,690
t: Yeah, anyway. If you want to talk about
this,

347
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,710
we are in CCC until the end, probably.

348
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,960
And so, yeah, we'd be glad to

349
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,840
answer your questions now, or we can look

350
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,380
at my mails. Okay! Questions?

351
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:11,390
*applause*

352
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:16,200
Herald: Okay, Merci beaucoup, taziden et kload

353
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,990
and do we have questions from the stream viewers

354
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:25,020
or from the audience?

355
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,700
That is not the case,
so thank you for your talk!

356
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,710
t: Thank you! Thank you!

357
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:37,910
*applause*

358
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,870
Herald: Okay, there is a question! Where?

359
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,580
Microphone 3!

360
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,310
Question: So thank you for the talk!

361
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,560
I don't have much knowledge about your

362
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,140
technology so far, so excuse if the question

363
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,650
is misplaced.

364
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,760
How does it compare to the Tor network

365
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,220
in terms of
anonymous access and stuff?

366
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,720
k: It actually doesn't compare to the

367
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,740
Tor network. We can not compare that.

368
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,310
t: But in terms of anoynmity: it doesn't

369
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,530
make you anonymous.
it's quite the opposite, actually.

370
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,170
The only thing that this box can do is

371
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,130
when you connect to it in the WiFi

372
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,840
in your house, everything that you do

373
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,620
all your connection, internet connection

374
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,040
is not readable any more for your actual

375
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,520
your commercial ISP.

376
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,060
Your connection becomes readable for

377
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:42,610
your local friendly organisation that

378
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,320
gives you this access.

379
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,170
Question: So you have to worry about your

380
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,890
end to end connections.

381
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,550
t: yeah! So as always.

382
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,100
Herald: So now I see people lining up.

383
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,720
Microphone 2 please!

384
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,440
Question: Hi, can it
send emails to Gmail

385
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,750
or is it just within your network?

386
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,960
And how does it work because the

387
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,160
filter home ISP usually at large providers?

388
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,600
You have to have a trusted IP to send

389
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,280
email to Gmail and others.

390
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,460
t: Yes, the ISP—the local ISP—gives you an

391
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,100
actual IP address on the this box

392
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,290
and this box can definitely send emails

393
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,600
to Gmail and receive emails from Gmail.

394
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,560
It's just easily …
it is linked to one of your domain.

395
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,830
So it is your domain that you are using.

396
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,660
Here it was various.expert

397
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,660
but you can definitely have
a more standard domain

398
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,010
But yes, with that you can receive emails

399
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:44,580
to your_nickname@your_domain.

400
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,930
Yes, definitely.

401
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,210
Herald: And there is a question
at microphone 4?

402
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,530
Question: Hi, I am originating for Tunisia,

403
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:56,580
so I am a little bit interested
in what you did in Tunisia

404
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,490
and during the Tunisian Arab spring revolution

405
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,520
it was that mesh networks, AIDA mesh network,

406
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,220
was that something you did or?

407
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,920
t: No not we! You want to answer maybe...

408
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,150
k: No you...

409
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,380
t: No, I will... sorry. No we didn't make

410
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,260
mesh network but this is really something

411
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,270
we can imagine with those kind of devices

412
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,860
but this is not what we did in Tunisia.

413
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,020
In Tunisia we just had those devices

414
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,010
as pirateboxes to distribute documents

415
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,120
and that's it.

416
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,800
Questioner: Thank you!

417
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:39,380
Herald: Okay, I don't see anybody
at the mics, right?

418
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,300
Okay then thanks again!

419
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,430
t: Thank you!
k: Thanks!

420
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,140
*applause*
