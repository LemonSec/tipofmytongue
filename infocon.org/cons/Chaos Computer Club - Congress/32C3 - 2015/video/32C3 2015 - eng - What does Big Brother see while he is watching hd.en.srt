00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:09,264
*preroll music*

2
00:00:09,264 --> 00:00:12,579
Herald Angel: What does Big Brother see
while he is watching?

3
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,879
Simon Menner is talking to you about this:

4
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:19,860
"Uncovering Images from the secret Stasi Archives."

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,510
He was born 1978 in southern Germany,

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,120
now he lives and works in Berlin.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,289
He does a lot of stuff with photography

8
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:33,540
and history. And he has been researching

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,780
for three years in Stasi files and images.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,030
And he is going to show us why this is

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,739
still relevant today, or even

12
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,840
more relevant than ever. 
Give him a warm welcome.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,160
*applause*

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,960
Simon: thank you.

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,829
I was told to use this rather than the

16
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:03,550
lavalier mic, so I hope it works.

17
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,309
First a disclaimer: I'm an artist

18
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,990
I am not a historian, so my approach to

19
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,100
the material I am going to show you is

20
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,100
somewhat different from what you might expect

21
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,700
from a regular historian. But we can

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,720
discuss this as we go on.

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,540
And very very briefly, before I am going

24
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,549
to show you images I have found at the

25
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,159
archive of the Stasi and some very few

26
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,049
I have found at the archive of the BND -

27
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:32,729
I am going to show you three bodies of work

28
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:35,900
that brought me to my interest in the

29
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,470
Stasi files. So, I am a trained artist.

30
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,510
I'm a photographer and normally I do

31
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:47,860
things like this. I am very interested in

32
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,140
the relationship of perception... what

33
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,920
perception does within the context

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,520
of modern conflict. It turns out,

35
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,930
more importantly, perception is a battle field.

36
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,630
And fear is a weapon. And this is actually

37
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,650
not just a set of landscape images.

38
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,340
It is actually a set of photographs for

39
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,550
which I had to have support by the German
Army.

40
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,470
They supported me with snipers.

41
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,599
They were hiding in the landscape and were

42
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,860
aiming at the camera, and therefore at the

43
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,580
viewer. Which is ... okay ... of course.

44
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,620
So, the sniper would be here. And in most

45
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,069
of the pictures from this series there is

46
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:32,349
actually almost no trace to be seen from

47
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:34,810
the sniper. But this is the way

48
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,260
a sniper looks within the landscape.

49
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,440
So they were ordered to aim at me.

50
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,870
Even though I couldn't see them. So,

51
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,510
sometimes, when they were posing, I told

52
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,050
them: "Well, just don't hide behind a tree

53
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,879
and I don't see you." And they told me:

54
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:53,970
"No no, don't worry, we are aiming at you."

55
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,040
*laughter*

56
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,830
Of course, the whole thing is artificial.

57
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,790
Because they would never choose this kind

58
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,720
of setting and this kind of environment

59
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,319
for their... To pose a threat.

60
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,069
There's a sniper here, or

61
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:07,709
there's a sniper here.

62
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:10,010
But this is something that really plays an

63
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,840
important role in today's conflicts

64
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,090
That you try to occupy your opponent's mind.

65
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,129
And influence his or her behaviour

66
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:21,410
in that way, through creating fear. That's

67
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:26,190
another set of images, it's based on

68
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,950
handbooks by the US Army on how to

69
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,200
construct booby traps out of ordinary

70
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,590
objects. Like here, a TV set or radio.

71
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,819
If you switch it on, it blows up. A box,

72
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:39,349
or a pipe - as an artist, I find this

73
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:41,330
image very intriguing, because there is

74
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,760
this one very famous painting by Margritte

75
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,550
´This is not a pipe' - actually, this is

76
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,330
not a pipe, laughter

77
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,519
even though it is supposed to look like a
pipe.

78
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:51,440
*applause*

79
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,159
So be aware, that's from the sixties, from

80
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,489
the US Army, and these handbooks are now

81
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:01,010
out there and used by the opposing forces.

82
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,849
By forces they encounter. And the

83
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:06,780
whole story behind these manuals is, well,

84
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,290
you're supposed to create fear in your

85
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,120
opponent. Here is a German chocolate bar,

86
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,190
if you break it, it blows up in your face.

87
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:20,699
Or a tea kettle. The more ordinary objects

88
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:23,129
are, the more terrifying it becomes.

89
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,729
Because once you realise that there is no

90
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:30,099
way for you to avoid this idea of fear

91
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:32,759
everything is dangerous. Of course

92
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,759
the other side does this as well.

93
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:37,539
This is from videos I found online.

94
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:41,009
This is the last video frame before the blast.

95
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:42,900
So the last video frame before a car bomb

96
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,629
or roadside bomb or something like this

97
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:48,900
explodes. And the same here.

98
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,860
So, it's the same technique. The more I

99
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,809
was... the more research I did,

100
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:58,539
in this big topic of fear and

101
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:00,770
perception within conflict,

102
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,309
I started to think more and more

103
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:04,960
about the topic of surveillance.

104
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,539
Because the interesting aspect

105
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,300
would be to look at images from, of

106
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,539
surveillance. Because that would show us

107
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:15,999
these mechanisms from the other side.

108
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:18,110
but the strange thing is, we talk so much

109
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,050
about surveillance. And much of what we

110
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,779
talk about is image based. So,

111
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:25,349
'Big Brother is watching you.'

112
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:27,430
That has something to with images.

113
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,430
But we take it for granted that there's

114
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,199
nothing for us to see.

115
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,969
Big Brother is watching us, but is hidden

116
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:35,899
behind some curtains. But I came to realise

117
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:38,330
that actually, withing the very unique

118
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,499
history of Germany we have this huge

119
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:45,860
opportunity in the Stasi archives that are

120
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,469
accessible to the public, to do, try to

121
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:53,669
show what Big Brother actually sees.

122
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:55,879
And I approached them because I could only

123
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,839
find written references to images they have.

124
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,939
And asked them: "Why?"

125
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,830
I could never find any images. So,

126
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,569
do they still exist? And they told me:

127
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:09,339
"Sure, come over." And that was the start

128
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:14,020
of a three year, or lengthy, research project.

129
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,349
And first I am going to show you images

130
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:18,009
I was then, in the end, not really

131
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:20,389
interested in. Images we know exist.

132
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:24,490
So, from now on, that's authentic Stasi

133
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,409
material. There is some from the Czech Republic

134
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:32,539
ČSSR. I will point them out and in the end

135
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,990
there is some from the BND, I'll point

136
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,899
those out as well. That is something

137
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:41,379
we expect to see: shots taken through

138
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:45,349
button holes and surveillance industries.

139
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:47,710
That's the US embassy in East Berlin.

140
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,249
And the entrance doors were all under

141
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:55,139
constant surveillance. With photo cameras

142
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,919
and video cameras. But be aware, in the 80s

143
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,919
the video equipment was not that sophisticated.

144
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:03,490
So, at night time, the Stasi did record

145
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,580
eight hours of darkness. But it still

146
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,399
ended up in the files. *laughter*

147
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,669
That's the state of mind we are talking about.

148
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:12,619
So, everyone was photographed,

149
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:15,429
and then we have, quite often we find post

150
00:07:15,429 --> 00:07:20,080
boxes, where everyone posting a letter is

151
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,879
photographed. No matter, who he or she is.

152
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,770
Even if it's an elderly lady. Remember

153
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,179
these images, because I am going to

154
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:30,939
reference to them later. I was more interested

155
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:34,029
in something like this. So, the

156
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:39,110
internal view. And now, two years ago I

157
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,999
was able to publish a book and now I am

158
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:43,550
going to somewhat follow the structure

159
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,229
within the book, because I was really

160
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:47,869
interested in how do you become a spy?

161
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:50,969
And I encountered a lot of material

162
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:53,729
that was meant for training purposes.

163
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:55,949
These images are from a training session

164
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:59,749
on how to disguise yourself as regular citiizens.

165
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:01,389
laughter

166
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:05,289
Which I found quite strange, because

167
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:10,259
normally that's nothing you should have to
learn.

168
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,739
But still, and then you have a soldier.

169
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:17,830
These ordinary citizens: some of them look

170
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,169
like they live now in Berlin, amongst the
hipsters

171
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:26,039
like this one laughter that was entitled

172
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,789
'Western Tourist' laughter

173
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:31,219
Another tourist, like, the photographer.

174
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,419
So, the Stasi photographed something that

175
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:38,360
tried to look like a photographer. So.

176
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,849
Women work for the Stasi as well.

177
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:46,300
The same thing, disguising manuals.

178
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,730
What do you need to dress up like this.

179
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,240
And in what circumstance would you use

180
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,079
something like this. He looks like from

181
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:56,410
'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' I think.

182
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,810
But be aware, that's not meant to be funny.

183
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,720
That was not meant to be seen by any one

184
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,500
of you or me. That was meant to train agents.

185
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,720
And we are going to see later it was

186
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,519
actually used, here we have a hitchhiker,

187
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,810
at a motor way around Berlin. And that is

188
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,730
from the ČSSR archives to which I was

189
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,769
granted acces earlier this year. They did

190
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:27,350
the same thing, so it's not just something

191
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,519
the Stasi did, they did it as well.

192
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,180
And then you had other certain aspects of

193
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:40,110
how to disguise, like how to wear a wig.

194
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,629
Or how to stick a fake mustache.

195
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:48,199
For privacy concerns, the images had to

196
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:50,910
be pixeled. But I could see the faces

197
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,800
while researching the archives.

198
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,690
Much funnier, actually. So, to stick fake

199
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,360
mustaches... Then, again from the ČSSR,

200
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,220
you could also disguise cars. Like,

201
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,290
you could draw something that's from a

202
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:16,170
steel mill in the ČSSR. And then, in a way

203
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:23,029
a disguised stroller, with a video camera.

204
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:25,660
And that is actually a video camera from

205
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,769
Japan, they imported this type of surveillance

206
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:35,810
equipment quite frequently. Then you

207
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,439
encounter other material, like how to

208
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:44,240
transmit secret signals and how to transmit

209
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,899
codes, the codes are not known now,

210
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:49,480
but still, the photos exist and they have

211
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,420
a strange beauty in them.

212
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,310
And then, once you got your training, you

213
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,920
had got to be taught how to arrest someone.

214
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,620
And then you first knock the door, and

215
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,399
then you arrest him and - notice the piece

216
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,980
of cloth on the floor, cause they didn't

217
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,160
want to ruin his white shirt -

218
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,550
and maybe he wants to fight, so you have

219
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:21,560
to fight laughter So. But the Stasi
always

220
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,910
wins. And again, the ČSSR they took things

221
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,870
very seriously. Things they wanted to

222
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,279
escalate much quicker. So you have to shoot

223
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,000
people - booh - and again,

224
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,310
it quickly escalates, he has to be shot.

225
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:44,550
And then, when you know that, you have to

226
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,180
be taught how to follow people around.

227
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,850
This - sometimes you find these very

228
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,139
elaborate stories where you follow people

229
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:55,230
around, this is just a very short exception.

230
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,100
So, she is at the bakery, and then she goes

231
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,459
to the doctor's office, which is already

232
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:04,329
something the Stasi maybe shouldn't know.

233
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:07,339
But still - and then she does a phone call

234
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:09,350
And here she is smiling at the camera.

235
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,189
Of course, the whole thing is staged for

236
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,350
the colleagues. But this sometimes is

237
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,310
very lengthy, you see this guy shopping,

238
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,160
and shopping, and walking at Alexanderplatz,

239
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,249
and meeting an other guy... It's like a

240
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:25,529
photo love story. *laughter*

241
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:27,910
And then they take the car and he gets off

242
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,670
the car in the middle of the woods, and

243
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,040
then he walks and an other car comes.

244
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,819
And then they meet...

245
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,430
Why do you take such pictures?

246
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,269
What's the point of that? But still,

247
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:39,910
that ends up at the archive.

248
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,100
And is part of the training operation.

249
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,389
Now, the training is done,

250
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:51,779
This then is a real surveillance photograph,

251
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,269
you see a black arrow, that's supposedly

252
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:57,089
the person they were shadowing, and then

253
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:58,779
you see, 'okay, we are not in the

254
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,339
training manual anymore, but we are

255
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:05,639
already a step ahead, and that's then the

256
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:08,449
real material. He or she is followed

257
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:13,129
around the country. Again, the Czech Republic,

258
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:16,490
you have, like, ordinary citizens

259
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:21,629
being shadowed entering a house.

260
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:24,819
After the shadowing comes also the

261
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:28,100
breach of privacy. And here we have the

262
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,209
room of a teenager, which looks very

263
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:34,649
innocent to us - but I am very positive

264
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:37,620
that this - I guess it's a guy -, that he

265
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,579
never entered university in East Germany.

266
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:43,269
Due to the fact that they could prove that

267
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:46,069
he was a fan of 'Wile E. Coyote' and the

268
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:49,939
United States, or so they thought, they

269
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:52,420
couldt prove. And they took such images

270
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,509
as evidence for your thinking. Which is

271
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:57,220
a problem of a surveillance operation,

272
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,399
I would argue. And then here we have,

273
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,559
- I don't know if you can see - there

274
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:04,439
might be the biggest Madonna fan of all of

275
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:08,509
Communist Eastern Europe. laughter

276
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:11,550
Same thing, probably would never be able

277
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,870
to study law, or medicine, or something

278
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,079
like that. And then you have, frequently,

279
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,149
- sorry, cover your eyes maybe - frequently

280
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:25,930
you have images such as this. And that was

281
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,990
classified as 'Western Pornography', and

282
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,220
the funny thing about this classification

283
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,670
is, very often you find files, that read

284
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,860
'Western Pornography', and the photographs

285
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,509
are missing. *laughter*

286
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:43,720
So, someone went to this appartment,

287
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,139
documented everything, archived it, and

288
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:49,259
maybe the guy was persecuted, and when no

289
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:51,559
one was looking, they took the pictures.

290
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:56,069
Which then shows the absurd nature of the

291
00:14:56,069 --> 00:15:02,019
system. For me, this is a very... key image.

292
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:05,490
And a set of images. But this is actually

293
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,629
one of the images that brought me to

294
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:11,629
contacting the Stasi Archive. I read about

295
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:13,990
those images, this is a Polaroid, as you

296
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,160
can see by the white background.

297
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,870
And, as a matter of fact, the Stasi

298
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,949
frequently purchased Polaroid films or

299
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:25,339
confiscated ones sent to East Germany.

300
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:26,730
And the reason for that was, when they

301
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,970
broke into peoples' homes, and you should

302
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,480
never find out, the easiest thing was: You

303
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,319
break in, you look around, what's interesting,

304
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:37,519
you take a Polaroid, and with the help of

305
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,509
the Polaroid you are able to put everything

306
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:41,899
back into the original position.

307
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,990
So, this is an absolutely brutal image.

308
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,269
Because it shows the deepest possible

309
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:52,209
breach of privacy imaginable.

310
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:54,920
And most people in fact never found out

311
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,559
their apartment was searched, and that was

312
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,240
absolutely illegal, even in East Germany.

313
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,220
And, so it was very revealing last year,

314
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,779
a German TV Station thought it was a clever

315
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:06,949
idea to bring me, hook me up with a

316
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:10,809
former Stasi general. And he - And I told

317
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:13,170
him about the Polaroids. And he said:

318
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:16,709
"Yeah, but, eh, ähm, please, keep in mind,

319
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,990
I've, I never broke into peoples' apartments."

320
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,600
And I said: "Yeah, well, did you order it?"

321
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,740
"Yes I ordered it, but I never broke

322
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,089
into peoples' houses!"

323
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:29,300
And I thought, what stupid excuse is that?

324
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,009
Who then is responsible? Because normally

325
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:33,939
the excuse is always, oh, I was ordered to.

326
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:35,970
And his excuse was, yeah, I just ordered

327
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,709
them, but I didn't really, why would

328
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:40,889
they do it? *gasping* I just ordered
it...

329
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:45,619
Was not my intention... So that really was

330
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:47,470
revealing to me, like, the state of mind

331
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,519
within such a system. So, you have

332
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,059
folders and folders and folders of those

333
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:56,259
Polaroids. And when they found something

334
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:58,860
incriminating, they might have returned

335
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,069
a few days later with the police and a

336
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:02,639
search warrant. Because they needed a

337
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,148
search warrant, even in East Germany.

338
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:10,839
So, and now we realise, even though it looks

339
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,148
funny, the way they disguise themselves,

340
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:15,648
it's meant seriously. And it's a terrible,

341
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:18,140
brutal system. Which you also see in these

342
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,220
images from the ČSSR, where the people

343
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,059
are forced to stage their own attempt of

344
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,619
fleeing the country. So they were made

345
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:30,000
to stage the thing they were arrested for.

346
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,090
Even a young child was made to reenact

347
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,350
their failed attempt to flee the country,

348
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,860
and this is brutal.

349
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,630
And, so, sometimes you find images that

350
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,980
are completely out of any category.

351
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,130
*laughter*

352
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,970
Like a guinea pig - I told you earlier - to

353
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,970
think back - remember the post box with

354
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,590
the old lady. That's an image of one of

355
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:02,610
those files. So you have an image of

356
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,720
a post box, you see it, taken from a high

357
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,029
angle. And, maybe, out of a private apartment.

358
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:11,860
And my, and then, you have this shot after

359
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,149
shot after shot. And two pictures of

360
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:15,830
this guinea pig.

361
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,029
And then the surveillance operation

362
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,610
continues. And what I read out of that is

363
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,539
that he was in a private apartment, and

364
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:27,059
was bored - and there ran this guinea pig.

365
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,850
And he lies flat on the ground,

366
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,320
takes two shots, and then continues the

367
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,390
surveillance operation. Knowing, that the

368
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,779
material is going to end up at the archive.

369
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:41,960
And gets its archive number.

370
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,549
That's German bureaucracy, I guess.

371
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:49,190
Very revealing - so these guys, that's

372
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,250
actually a British spy, there were some

373
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,210
officially registered Western spies within

374
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,250
East Germany. The Russians had the same

375
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,309
thing for West Germany. And the Stasi's

376
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:04,710
job was to follow them and document what

377
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,370
they were doing. They couldn't do anything

378
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,299
to them, they could only document it.

379
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,870
And you find many of these images.

380
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,820
A spy taking a picture of a spy, in an

381
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,830
endless circle of surveillance. *laughter*

382
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,860
And what's very revealing is the fact

383
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,580
that I tried to gain access to the, to

384
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,529
their material - it's still classified.

385
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:28,409
*laughter*

386
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:31,240
I am very positive I know what the images

387
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,700
show: It's very much the same thing.

388
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,630
*laughter*

389
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,500
But, so, I tried to understand what

390
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,230
these people are thinking. But, it turns out,

391
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,840
even though they were fighting each other,

392
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,190
they seemed to share a very common

393
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,570
state of mind.

394
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:50,519
But, so, that looks like the end point

395
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,480
of surveillance.

396
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,260
No, it's not.

397
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,380
It's one step further: Stasi agents,

398
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,090
watching Stasi agents watching other people.

399
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:05,559
That's a triangle of surveillance, ja.

400
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:08,350
Common as well, never be sure about

401
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,149
your colleagues, they could be up to something.

402
00:20:11,149 --> 00:20:14,620
So, better spy on them as well.

403
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,240
But then, I present you, the absolute

404
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,140
high point and end point of surveillance:

405
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,800
Which is the surveillance selfie.

406
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:30,180
*laughter and applause*

407
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,960
I give you another one.

408
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,899
And they knew it was going to end up at

409
00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:42,809
the archive. So they are spying on

410
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,990
themselves, while spying on others, while

411
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,070
they are spying on themselves.

412
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,789
So, it's this: it's almost meditative.

413
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:53,330
And now, who are these people?

414
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,580
Now we are really at the internal view.

415
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,250
The Stasi looks at itself. Here is a

416
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,370
group photo. Remember this guy -

417
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,309
we encounter him later.

418
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:07,990
That happens to be the phone surveillance
unit.

419
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,940
Highest ranking officials here,

420
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,429
that's the boss of the whole bunch.

421
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:15,919
And, of course, the Stasi, Eastern Europe...

422
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,559
they like their medals. And then an

423
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,700
award ceremony. Flowers, medal, piece of paper.

424
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,760
And there is the guy from the phone

425
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,919
surveillance unit, again, so, he gets

426
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,549
really shabby flowers. And, piece of paper.

427
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:37,510
That's odd: see this, the wax seal? And,

428
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,100
it's burnt at the side?

429
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,330
Because: He was knighted.

430
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,659
A knight of the phone surveillance unit.

431
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:54,590
*timid laughter, applause*

432
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,700
See this, to the Non-Germans here:

433
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,669
That Section Symbol stands for the Code of
Law,

434
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:05,380
this isn't widely used outside Germany,

435
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,519
He knew that they were breaking the law,

436
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:10,200
and they're mocking it.

437
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,440
They're mocking it with this ceremony.

438
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,919
So now, here, you are the knight

439
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:16,720
of the phone surveillance unit.

440
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,130
Congratulations. Haha, what a good joke.

441
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,990
Another set of images, which is very

442
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:27,179
revealing, is this:

443
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,010
Strange finding in the Stasi archive.

444
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,159
A strange combination, see. The bishop

445
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,980
and a soccer player, and back there,

446
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,929
with the blue shirt, that's a Party youth

447
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:44,970
member. And see the ballerina there?

448
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,460
Strange. The guy in the suit: It's his

449
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,610
birthday. And he is the boss of them.

450
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,419
Theses are all highest ranking Stasi officials.

451
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:58,909
And they're surprising him with a birthday
party.

452
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:00,890
And the surprise is to dress up as

453
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:05,000
those people you put under surveillance.

454
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,210
So, see, Party Youth, soccer player,

455
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,409
another soccer player, the ballerina.

456
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:16,850
Beautiful, very beautiful.

457
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,200
Soccer fan, of course you have to put

458
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,490
them under surveillance. A doctor!

459
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,200
Of course, who cares about the right

460
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,710
to confidentiality of doctors. A judge.

461
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:32,559
Of course, you have to put that judge under
surveillance.

462
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,289
And that is a disguise, a dress-up,

463
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:40,909
hardly to be understood outside Germany.

464
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:45,399
He's dressed up as a peace activist.

465
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:48,950
He wears this 'Swords to ploughshares'

466
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,299
("Schwerter zu Pflugscharen') sticker

467
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:53,330
on his head, and some other peace stickers

468
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,419
there, and he is very proud of himself.

469
00:23:56,419 --> 00:24:01,080
Why is that? Because it was such a successful

470
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,960
costume...

471
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,070
I think: 'Where did the get the costume from?'

472
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,340
The easiest thing, for someone

473
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,250
like him, would be to take it from

474
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,649
somebody he put in jail.

475
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:16,409
Because you could at least lose access

476
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:19,070
to university for wearing one of these stickers.

477
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,169
At least. Or you could serve some, short,

478
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:24,240
time, but some time in jail.

479
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,799
You could lose access to good housing and

480
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,320
everything. Why is he able to mock it?

481
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,049
Because he is the one who would decide

482
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:35,299
whether or not you lose access...

483
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:38,049
And this is the terrible thing about these
images.

484
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:40,710
They are very revealing.

485
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:47,659
--I am very fast...--

486
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:52,470
So, these images are now, what,

487
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,880
25, 30, years old. Why do I think they

488
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,110
are still relevant today?

489
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,380
It's because of something like this:

490
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,809
there was a short period, after

491
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:05,820
the fall of the Berlin Wall, so the

492
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:11,360
Wall fell in November '89, and the Stasi

493
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,230
wasn't desolved until January. So there

494
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,760
was a very short period of time

495
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,389
where the Stasi could actually try to

496
00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:20,659
destroy material. They managed to do

497
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:23,700
destroy a huge bunch of material.

498
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,500
Not very important sets - except for

499
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,620
espionage, that's almost gone.

500
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,340
But if it would have been up to them,

501
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,929
that would have been the fate of all these
images.

502
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:42,059
Destruction.

503
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,679
We would have had never been able to look

504
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,690
at these images. And,

505
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,220
even though we don't know what these images

506
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,860
stand for - that's a group of gay men -

507
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,779
and they infiltrated it and it was

508
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:56,350
compromising to one of their colleagues

509
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,490
that they infiltrated it, they did things

510
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:03,480
like that. But, they tried to destroy it.

511
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,409
So, 25 years after the fall of the Berlin
Wall,

512
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:09,360
even more now, why do I

513
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,620
still think this material is really relevant?

514
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,950
I am going to show you something

515
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:17,630
that's even more special and more rare,

516
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,549
than the material I showed you just now.

517
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:23,019
It's this:

518
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:24,820
Over the course of approximately a year

519
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,730
I tried to convince the BND to grant me

520
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,169
access to their material. Which would

521
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:33,220
be amazing because in Germany we have

522
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,120
this one society with the two

523
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,760
opposing systems. So the view on the

524
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,980
cold war would be absolutely astonishing

525
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,299
if we would be able to look at all

526
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,080
the material.

527
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,250
And, after a year, I got the call,

528
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,730
and they told me: "yes, we have something

529
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,620
for you, come over."

530
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,220
There was actually, they have a small,

531
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,669
relatively small section in Berlin.

532
00:26:57,669 --> 00:26:59,919
So I went there with my Scanner and they

533
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,919
gave me the - I would call them -

534
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,909
14 most boring pictures of

535
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:09,519
the BND history.

536
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:12,510
It's a match box.

537
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,510
This...

538
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,979
and that.

539
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:18,070
And, when I looked at these images,

540
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,799
I was like, 'are you kidding me?'

541
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,309
What do they show?

542
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:23,389
And this guy was very serious and told me:

543
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:24,880
"Unfortunately I can't tell you because

544
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,759
the information is still classified."

545
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:31,850
*laughter*

546
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:37,309
But then, he told me, as far as

547
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:39,509
he knows, these are the only images

548
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:41,450
they ever released.

549
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:45,289
And, yeah, toothpaste.

550
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:48,000
There´s a huge problem I have

551
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,070
with this, of course.

552
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,970
Not with this young lady in particular,

553
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,600
but in general with these images.

554
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,779
They can decide which images to show.

555
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,880
And one of the guys I was in contact with
told me:

556
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,149
"Of course we have these disguise pictures...

557
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:08,830
and dress up, and things like that."

558
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:12,200
But, keep in mind, even though back then

559
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,710
he might have been the lowest in the hierarchy.

560
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,600
He might be the head of the department now.

561
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,700
Or the one who brought in the guy who is now

562
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,480
the head of the department.

563
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,070
Of course it's not in their interest

564
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,179
for these images to be released.

565
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:32,159
And then I think, 'but it's in my interest'

566
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,720
And in our interest, to decide, what images

567
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,559
are worth looking at or not.

568
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,990
And there is another problem with images

569
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:45,070
like this. We have almost nothing that is

570
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,179
accessible from the Western archives.

571
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:50,950
This is rare, this is very special.

572
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:55,120
Looks like shit, but it's very special.

573
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,049
But we have a trove from the Eastern archives.

574
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:02,820
And there is always, like the Merkel, and
like, everyone --

575
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:07,820
when one of the Eastern countries decides,

576
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:13,299
'maybe we should limit access to our former
Stalinist archive...'

577
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:15,460
they say 'no, don't do that!!'

578
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,049
'it must be open' - but what happens when
we

579
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:20,580
have access to just one side?

580
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,779
And see all the terrible things they are doing?

581
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:26,090
And have no access to the other side?

582
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,289
I am not saying that the BND did the same
terrible things

583
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:32,269
the Stasi did. But the BND was certainly breaking

584
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:34,659
our laws as well...

585
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:37,299
And so, but it does look more innnocent,

586
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:39,350
because we only know, have access to a very

587
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,730
terrible looking archive.

588
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,559
And if we look to West Germany,

589
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,370
it's like: 'Nothing there.'

590
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,190
Must be fine...

591
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,250
And that is a terrible thing.

592
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:52,960
There is a lot wrong with that.

593
00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:03,599
-- I am almost at the end, I was rushing through...sorry
--

594
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:10,649
-- But…I can show you two…well --

595
00:30:10,649 --> 00:30:13,960
Just because I was too quick: from the Czech
archive,

596
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,000
two videos. audio isn't important.

597
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,899
Oh, sorry, maybe it's not going to work.

598
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:24,820
It seems things escalated much quicker.

599
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:29,159
In the ČSSR... than in ... Sorry...

600
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:44,490
Live in the ČSSR must have been very dangerous.

601
00:30:44,490 --> 00:31:00,490
These weapons, everywhere...

602
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:09,260
*soft, pacy music*

603
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,419
But the best thing comes now:

604
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:28,800
*laughter*

605
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:42,020
Who would carry something like that, there.

606
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:50,629
*applause*

607
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:54,250
And just, if you wonder - that's a very long
film -

608
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,840
that's just a short part of it.

609
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,460
If you are ever attacked by someone with a
chair...

610
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,740
[in German] Ne, das ist nicht wichtig.

611
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,330
Audio ist ganz furchtbar.

612
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,879
That's like, six or seven times he shows that.

613
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:13,539
And now he shows it again.

614
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:15,990
And then it is going to be used, but look

615
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,799
closely how it is used, the technique they
just learned.

616
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:26,559
Okay, do this the next time you are attacked
by someone with a chair.

617
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,169
So, he is going to be attacked by someone
with a chair,

618
00:32:31,169 --> 00:32:35,330
watch closely, he implements it quite properly.

619
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,809
*laughter*

620
00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:41,759
Well, he didn't really.

621
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:49,610
And, things always, in this long film, always
escalate very quickly.

622
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:55,779
And here are two very long shots,

623
00:32:55,779 --> 00:32:59,039
and you are supposed to spot them, that are

624
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,229
unnecessarily long...

625
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:09,919
*laughter*

626
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,169
So, of course they find the black guy smuggling.

627
00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:16,440
And he explains to him now, in English:

628
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,720
'Do you have more?' And he says no, no.

629
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,169
And still, the porn is in the shot.

630
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,950
And then he tells him, yea, it's going to
be

631
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:29,389
very serious if you don't confess now.

632
00:33:29,389 --> 00:33:31,210
And the black guy says. no, I don't have anything

633
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,749
to confess...

634
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:36,259
And now the guy on the left gets suspicious.

635
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:40,559
Look at him.

636
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,909
Very suspicious, this black young man.

637
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:52,040
He doesn't want to sign his confession.

638
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,659
He gets suspicious, too.

639
00:33:58,659 --> 00:34:02,850
Very, very, very suspicious.

640
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:07,000
And, fortunately, the camera man made the
slight move to the left...

641
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,159
Not to zoom in on the penis [sic]

642
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,650
No, no, he doesn't have anything.

643
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:14,610
But it turns out, he has something.

644
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:18,540
Because he's black and suspicious looking.

645
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,659
See.

646
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:27,050
Oh, he's moving his arm.

647
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,650
*laughter*

648
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:55,090
So, it turns out his arm is not broken.

649
00:34:55,090 --> 00:35:00,850
Sorry, that was somewhat long, but I rushed
through before.

650
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:04,390
And for some reason, he hides batteries

651
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,380
in his cast.

652
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:14,130
*applause*

653
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:23,080
So, he could bring in the watches, but he'd
better hide the batteries.

654
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,560
Because that is, whoo....

655
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:30,580
So - any questions?

656
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:43,430
*applause*

657
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,510
Herald Angel: thank you

658
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,140
Simon: I hope you got what you paid for...

659
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,970
*laughter*

660
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:55,930
Herald: Maybe before we start Q&A, everybody
who wants to leave, leave now.

661
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,700
Simon: oh wow.

662
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,130
Herald: We are going to take one minute so
you can leave

663
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:07,820
and the others who want to stay have it quiet
for the Q&A

664
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:34,800
And remember to use the rating system.

665
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,860
Simon: Oh, I brought post cards, if you want
some.

666
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:44,640
Because we have to make fun of them as much
as we can

667
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,020
*applause*

668
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:54,900
They're all the same motive, but take as many
as you want, if you want any.

669
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,870
Herald: Thank you

670
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,050
*somenone too quietly to be understood*

671
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:14,240
Simon: Uh, with the microphone, I guess

672
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,280
Herald: There are two microphones for Q&A, 
no, four even, if you need them.

673
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,830
And we have questions from the internet.

674
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,010
Five seconds.

675
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:40,320
Okay. So, we will start with you!

676
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,440
Q: Just a short question, first, thanks for
the wonderful talk.

677
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,610
It was very very interesting.

678
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,640
Can you give us the title of your book, please?

679
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,530
Simon: Oh, it's pretty much top if you google
my name,

680
00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:00,000
it's available in your local book store, or,
if you want, Amazon.

681
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,380
It's still available, but there are not that
many

682
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:07,210
copies left, *starts acting* so you should all 
get it as soon as possible... *laughter*

683
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,610
It's just 'Top Secret' and Simon Menner...

684
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:14,190
Or just Menner, my family doesn't write that
many books... *more laughter*

685
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,520
Herald: Thank you, over here…

686
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:25,960
Q: Would you be so kind to go back to the
photo with Coyote and the American flag?

687
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:31,610
Because I thought I saw Yugoslav air transport
logo on the ...

688
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,110
yes, YAT,
there you see it.

689
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,070
Simon: Oh yea, here.

690
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:40,130
Q: He flew with, now it's called Air Serbia...

691
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:42,150
Simon: That must have been the reason.

692
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:45,350
Q: Yes, it must have, I just wanted to check...

693
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,770
Simon: Sure, thanks!

694
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,770
applause

695
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:53,000
Herald: We have a question from the internet...

696
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,610
Signal Angel: Yes, frankie2 is asking, how
does this

697
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:00,140
compare to today's surveillance?

698
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:04,610
Simon: The problem is, in a way, that is a

699
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:08,310
treasure trove, but it's a very weird one.

700
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:13,040
If I could decide, freely choose, what material
to look at,

701
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,690
I would definitely look at, try to look at,
the

702
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,670
last two weeks of NSA's surveillance.

703
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:20,290
Like we all would.

704
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:26,090
But, unfortunately, this is as close as we
can get this kind of material.

705
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:33,800
But keep in mind, back in it's days the Stasi
was at least as sophisticated as the BND.

706
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,430
In fact, they were more advanced in the technology
they used.

707
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:42,360
And the Stasi would definitely use the same

708
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:47,210
techniques BND and CIA and everyone else uses
today.

709
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:52,320
They would try to listen in on our phone conversations.

710
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,960
That might not be the right material to look at
from a technological point of view.

711
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,530
But I think this material is 
very interesting and important

712
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,630
if you want to find out something about their

713
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:08,880
state of mind. Which is, absurd. And keep
in mind,

714
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,110
the excuse you hear from the NSA,

715
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:16,170
they just want to protect the law, and that
is why they break the law,

716
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:20,210
that's an excuse you regularly find with the
Stasi as well.

717
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:24,940
And you find parallels, and that's why it's
very important to look at this material.

718
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,120
Even though it's very old.

719
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,050
And back then, the whole archive, consists
out

720
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,570
of somewhere between one and two million photographs.

721
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:38,870
Which is absurdly little, if you think that
the system

722
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,890
was in operation for forty years.

723
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:43,550
That's fifty thousand picture a year.

724
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:47,010
They had 85 thousand agents.

725
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,800
From today's standards, that's nothing.

726
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,790
Today, they would be far more sophisticated
I guess.

727
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:56,840
Herald: Thank you, we have a question over
there, is that a question, yes.

728
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,150
Q: Firstly, thank you for your talk.

729
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:04,510
So, you showed that some of that archive had
been

730
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:07,530
destroyed or attempts had been made.

731
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:12,680
But there was still much to look through.

732
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,300
What happens in future generations,

733
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,560
given that now surveillance is done all digitally,

734
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:25,900
you said the Stasi had a number of weeks from
when the wall fell,

735
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,900
and they had time to destroy things,

736
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,510
given now how quickly and easy it is 
to erase digital

737
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:36,510
information, what do you say to people coming
after you?

738
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:39,390
Future generations, who might want to find
similar things

739
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:43,360
in dissolved surveillance operations.
Are they completely stuffed?

740
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,320
Simon: Unless there is going to be a revolution,

741
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,540
they are not going to be able to look at anything.

742
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,430
That would be my guess.

743
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:54,050
Because you need this abrupt shift in the
whole system,

744
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:58,480
that pretty much decapitates this operation.
And so,

745
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,070
they lost everything, and now it is frozen
in time.

746
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:04,200
So, the guy at the BND told me:

747
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,320
"It's up to us to decide what we reveal and
what not, because we have a veto."

748
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,540
Of course, nothing is then revealed.

749
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,870
Ever.

750
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:18,110
So, as long as this stays the policy, and
it is the policy currently everywhere,

751
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,870
from what I understand,

752
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,880
you are not going to be able to look at anything.

753
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,220
I am not very optimistic in that respect.

754
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:35,100
Next Question: How do you 
decide

755
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:39,040
what faces to anonymise, and which not?

756
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,040
Simon: Besides the Czech Republic archive…
…with the Czech Images I did it.

757
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,440
With those images you can do anything and
whatever you want, and that's weird.

758
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,150
And terrible, in a way.

759
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,940
With the Stasi images, the archive had to
decide.

760
00:42:54,940 --> 00:43:00,020
And they decided on the basis that once you
work for,

761
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:07,080
in an official position, in times of historical
importance,

762
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,360
- like that - you lose your privacy rights.

763
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,110
You don't share the same privacy rights.

764
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:15,500
So, once we could find written evidence

765
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:21,860
that a person shown in the image
was working for the Stasi,

766
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,930
like him or her,

767
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:27,170
they lost their right of privacy.

768
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:30,150
If the slightest doubt remained, it had to
be pixeled.

769
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,839
So it wasn't done by me.

770
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:37,780
German privacy rights are very strict.

771
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:43,830
Next Questioner: You said, when you talked
about surveillance,

772
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:49,530
watching each other, that this would be the
highest state of surveillance.

773
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:53,150
But don't you think that now there is a much
higher state,

774
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:55,970
and also before things were much more clear,

775
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:57,770
everybody knew that there was a regime

776
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:00,290
trying to stay in power and trying to put
down everybody.

777
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:05,830
But now, in a situation where they don't even
have to break the law,

778
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:08,660
they just make it legal to surveil, like we
can see in France,

779
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,610
now with the law on intelligence,

780
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,550
that passed just after the Charlie murders,

781
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:16,460
and now we got the murders again,

782
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,360
and you have people who have

783
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,800
to stay in their home, because

784
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,210
the intelligence has said that

785
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:22,770
they might protest, and they don't have

786
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:26,120
to go through a judge, actually making it 
legal.

787
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:32,280
And we are at a stage were people surveil
each other.

788
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:37,100
Simon: That's Facebook today.
- Yes, somehow.

789
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,400
*applause*

790
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,420
And the general problem with survellance operations

791
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:48,350
- I would argue - and I hope someone here is
from the BND and they come forward

792
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:52,100
and I give a talk to them, 
because I would really like to find out.

793
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:57,227
So please, my email was there -

794
00:44:57,227 --> 00:45:00,980
I would argue, is that this type 
of surveillance can not work.

795
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:04,340
What you are trying to find proof for

796
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,810
is a state of mind, is thoughts, 
is not something you did,

797
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:13,970
but some things you think about, 
or you might wanna do.

798
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:16,610
And photography - I am a photographer -

799
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,500
I know how bad photography is.

800
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,920
You were looking at images of landscapes,

801
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,210
where no sniper is visible, and each one of
you saw it.

802
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:29,120
That's how bad photography is as evidence.

803
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,240
And this can be proof for everything.
And nothing.

804
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,270
Q: They don't need photography now.

805
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,470
S: No, they use it.

806
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:40,010
Q: They just bring the paper to the prefect
police,

807
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:42,290
and he says 'okay, they're dangerous', and
tells

808
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:43,800
them they have to stay at home.

809
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,630
S: Ja, but they need proof or evidence for
something.

810
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,210
Q: They don't.

811
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:55,740
S: Maybe not... Now you leave behind such
a trail of evidence yourself.

812
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,410
That could be read somewhere in the future.

813
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:02,050
What happens in ten years, when in the US

814
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:06,770
like smoking, drinking 
isn't socially acceptable anymore.

815
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:10,460
What happens to you then, with your Facebook
entry

816
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,990
that's twenty years old then.

817
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:17,030
It's a weird system, yeah, but…
*shrugging*

818
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:20,240
Herald: We have another question from the
internet.

819
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,440
Signal Angel: Somebody from IRC is asking
whether you have tried

820
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,190
to contact other agencies?

821
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:31,410
S: Yes, like the BND, which was not very successful.

822
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:37,170
And regarding the spies taking pictures of spies
I tried with the British archive.

823
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,190
I know these pictures still exist.

824
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:42,020
I know where they exist.

825
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:45,070
But... sorry.

826
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:50,810
With the Czech, I was asked by the Goethe
Institut to approach them.

827
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:54,360
It was difficult and too lengthy 
to explain now,

828
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,590
it was very difficult working with them.

829
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:59,170
Language wise and because of the structure

830
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:02,460
of the Archive itself.

831
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:07,890
But they were very open, and if you want to
do more research,

832
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:11,050
go to the Czech Republic first, because it's
much easier to work with them

833
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:16,330
on a bureaucratic level, than with the Germans.

834
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:21,050
But the Germans are, in a way, more organised.

835
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:22,400
*laughter*

836
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,190
Well, they are Germans.

837
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:29,130
Herald: Your question:

838
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:34,290
Q: How hard was it to get the material, although
it is not classified anymore?

839
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:36,510
How much time did you invest?

840
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:41,540
S: The hardest time was the waiting periods
in between requests.

841
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,160
German bureaucracy takes forever.

842
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:50,540
But I am quite sure, I am from West Germany,
but now I have a huge file in this archive.

843
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,600
Because they compile everything.

844
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,750
So they keep track of every picture you're
looking at.

845
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:01,060
But the funny thing is, it's not hard at all,
you can do it as well.

846
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,780
You don't have to be a researcher.

847
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,360
And the archive considers research a human
right.

848
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,320
Which I learned then, and it's a very convenient
thing.

849
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:16,600
There are some elderly Stasi agents who spend
their retirement researching something something.

850
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,690
They can do that.

851
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:24,390
And the weird thing was, most of the pictures,
no one had looked at before.

852
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:29,470
That could be proven, because they keep track
of everything.

853
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:32,950
The process is lengthy but very easy

854
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:36,940
Q: When you decided to dig through the archive,

855
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:41,300
did you have to apply for a certain section.

856
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,890
or could you just walk in and say, show me
all your pictures.

857
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:51,100
S: No, they were very open, they may have
closed after me.

858
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:56,780
For them, it was strangely overwhelming,
the amount of feedback they got

859
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,700
after my book came out.

860
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:05,440
And they want to be left alone,
I think… (laughing)

861
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,480
You have to formulate it quite clearly.

862
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,050
Q: What exactly, your aim?

863
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:20,170
S: A theme. But for me, because it was new
to me, and to them as well,

864
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:24,940
the topic, 'Surveillance and Photography',
was very broad.

865
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:30,750
Now they get requests like 'We want to see
what Simon Menner saw.'

866
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,700
They don't accept something like this.

867
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,490
So, you have to come up with something more
clever.

868
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:37,300
Q: And how much time did you spend in their
dungeons?

869
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,180
S: Well, it took three years...

870
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:44,880
On and off, but it's mostly waiting,
in between.

871
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,220
Be patient.

872
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:51,220
Herald: Okay, your question.

873
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:54,840
Q: Modern state agencies, 
including NSA and BND, have this

874
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:58,710
mentality of 'Collect it all' passive intelligence.

875
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:01,830
It has this ability to minimise the impact
and damage.

876
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:05,890
No human eyes looking at specific pieces of surveillance.

877
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:08,160
Of course we know that's not true,

878
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,660
and they can zero-in if they want to.

879
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:16,100
Doesn't this make it very difficult,
as an archivist how do you

880
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,220
try to understand the state of mind,
when you have so much data, unprocessed?

881
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:28,920
How do you get in their mind, filtering through,
not no documents, but a hundred million documents?

882
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:35,170
S: One has to be very careful with such material,
because you look through their eyes.

883
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,860
That can be dangerous.

884
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:44,330
That's why I try not to provide that much
'background information'

885
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:50,240
because, that would be text compiled by the
Stasi agents.

886
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,980
So there is guilty and not guilty written
in the text.

887
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,500
And I don't want to look at these pictures
through their eyes.

888
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:03,680
But still I find it very revealing 
to look at the raw material.

889
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,000
And the Stasi would have collected all

890
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:13,590
if they had been able, they opened every parcel
to East Germany, every letter.

891
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:20,810
Paranoia wise, they were several steps ahead
of the NSA.

892
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:26,740
They had a university, and when you were studying
there, you could do your PhD, but you

893
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,260
weren't allowed to keep your notes during
the day,

894
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,800
they were locked away.

895
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,700
In safes with doors on two sides...

896
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,340
So they would copy them at night,

897
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,780
And you weren't allowed to keep your PhD thesis,

898
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:44,530
because it immediately became top secret.

899
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:48,090
And that really is paranoia.

900
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:54,440
I can not prove it. And that's 
the problem with the whole thing,

901
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,450
because one side remains closed.

902
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:03,140
And I guess they are
quite happy with that situation,

903
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:08,160
they can still say, no, we did something else.

904
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,620
Well, we can't tell you, but it's not like
this.

905
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:18,950
That is very vague, but I think the state
of mind is the same.

906
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:23,480
Q: What is the copyright on these pictures?
Are they in the public domain?

907
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,920
Can I use them for memes?

908
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,210
S: Uhm, no.
*laughter*

909
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:33,770
Well, most are on my website in a low resolution.

910
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:37,920
Which the archive doesn't like, but it's there.

911
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,530
The problem is that: There is a law that covers
the archive.

912
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:46,650
It's not like other archives in Germany.
It has its own law.

913
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:50,490
And that was written in the early 90's by
lawmakers.

914
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:53,310
We all know them and love them.

915
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:58,830
And they never thought of an artist coming
along and show them.

916
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:03,480
So the law covers publication.

917
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:10,980
Once you got access to material, 
you are allowed publicize it

918
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,070
Nothing else is stated.

919
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:17,910
But you aren't allowed to hand over the files.

920
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:22,850
And I had lengthy debates with the Archive
about what that could mean.

921
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:26,820
Since, when you have it on the website, you
hand out the files.

922
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,830
But I said no, it's publicising it 
-- no, no, no.

923
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:31,790
So, what's the difference? Well,

924
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:35,540
we don't really know but, ahem.

925
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:39,230
So, it's tricky.

926
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:45,250
And so many people copied it from my website,
so it is out there and gone.

927
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,800
Which I think is good.

928
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,060
Herald: We have time for one more question.

929
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:59,840
S: And I will be around, if you recognise
my bald head, talk to me.

930
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:04,710
Q; Where you able to access files other than
images?

931
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,890
Like audio from phone surveillance?

932
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:09,720
S: Ah, that is a very tricky thing.

933
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:14,170
You could listen to those, but getting them
is almost impossible.

934
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:17,820
Because, German privacy laws again.

935
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:27,040
And their argument is, whenever you speak,
you could reveal something private.

936
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:31,530
And that's their argument. Even though 
you might be Erich Honecker

937
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:37,880
or Helmut Kohl or something like that. 
But still it could be private what you're saying.

938
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,600
That's why they could never release them, and

939
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:48,230
you could not publish that, because it could
be private.

940
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:57,850
So, it's a somewhat strange law. 
But noone is going to change anymore.

941
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:00,680
Herald: And the last question over here.

942
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:07,830
Q: I am interested from where you know 
what was shown by the photographs.

943
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:14,410
Were there captions like "spies spying on spy"
or thought you about an explanation by yourself?

944
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:19,310
S: There are gazillions of km of files.

945
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:25,330
And just very few photographs, so there is
always alot of background information.

946
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:32,240
And the greatest thing… and why I… 
people I am absolutely thankful towards

947
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:37,440
are the… - there were only ladies - 
working really at the archive,

948
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,600
handing me the files, giving me copies.
Because the most important thing

949
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,350
- and that is always true 
working with an archive -

950
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:49,910
the trickiest part is, how do you find
something you don't know exists.

951
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:52,880
Because you can't ask for it.

952
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:58,150
'I am really looking for ... 
is there a birthday party?'

953
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:00,460
You will never ask for something like this.

954
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:05,760
But once you've earned the trust of the people
working there, they provide you

955
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,250
and provided me with these images.

956
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:12,980
Because they knew, in what direction 
I was looking for material.

957
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:18,910
There was in most cases 
background information.

958
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:26,360
There was one image I didn't include in the
talk of a dead swan.

959
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:30,040
It's a famous set of four images.

960
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:38,170
It was only known that it was found in a vault
owned by Erich Mielke, the head of Stasi, personally.

961
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:42,970
It's four images of a grave of 
a dead swan with a GDR flag.

962
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:47,840
That is very famous for being the biggest
mystery in the Stasi files,

963
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,610
because nothing can be found 
about these images.

964
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:53,530
I didn't include them in the talk, sorry.

965
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:59,610
But it's a dead swan, very mysterious, 
must have been important. *laughter*

966
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:02,920
Herald: Thank you Simon, very much.
Simon: Thank you.

967
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:07,400
*applause*

968
00:57:08,817 --> 00:57:12,917
*postroll music*
