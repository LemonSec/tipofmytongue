00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,100
*music*

00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:13,329
*startsound of an old mac (G3 or so)*

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:23,269
*laughter and applause*

4
00:00:32,097 --> 00:01:54,729
*electronic music*

5
00:01:54,729 --> 00:02:12,942
*applause*

6
00:02:12,942 --> 00:02:14,813
Carina: Welcome

7
00:02:14,813 --> 00:02:18,985
Linus: to 32c3

8
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:26,590
*applause*

9
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,910
Congratulations!

10
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:37,460
You have obtained access privileges to this
community event.

11
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:44,700
Gated communities are the leading model of
our societies

12
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:51,100
We all have seen and experienced them before,
from the outside.

13
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,970
Communities that wouldn't let us in.

14
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:00,520
Communities that wouldn't accept us as who
we are.

15
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:07,710
Communities that would exercise their power
over us.

16
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,950
But we have overcome

17
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,140
we didn't even mean to do so

18
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,980
we probably didn't even realize it at first

19
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:26,350
but when we build our own first gated communities

20
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:31,570
we came to enjoy their advantages

21
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:39,290
insurmountable borders keep out what we don't
know and hence fear

22
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:47,060
strong leaders and simple rules relieve us
of the burden of thinking for ourselves

23
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:55,120
and we're shielded from the reverse side of
our wealth, waste and wastefulness

24
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,340
with all of us being the same there is no
inequality anymore

25
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,190
Or is there?

26
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,970
With all of us having the same opinions
and beliefs

27
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,070
there is no dissent anymore.

28
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,710
Or is there?

29
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,700
Carina: And of course we like living in communities.

30
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:21,709
Living in the community is like living in
one of those bottles

31
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,900
they contain perfect little worlds.

32
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,470
Where everything fits together

33
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,990
and everybody shares the same philosophy

34
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,840
and if you look outside,

35
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,160
the bottle glass distorts your view

36
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,770
and what you see looks strange

37
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,630
and might even scare you

38
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,920
so you decide to stay inside

39
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:50,660
where it's comfy and safe and really really
boring.

40
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,610
we need to break the safety glass

41
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,250
there is so much out there to discover

42
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,560
there are new adventures waiting for us

43
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,000
new challenges to be mastered together

44
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,450
and new experiences waiting to be made.

45
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,210
this is what being a hacker, being a nerd

46
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,860
and being at Congress is about

47
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,980
to make new experiences

48
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,350
to start new challenges

49
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,000
and to learn something new.

50
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,230
Linus: So let us hereby release some steam

51
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:35,910
from the density and narrowness of our bottles.

52
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,639
*electronic rumbling and champagner cork popping sound*

53
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,370
And let us raise our glasses to the success

54
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,030
of the chaos expansion strategy.

55
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:58,120
*laughing*
*applause*

56
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,459
the chaos mentors have been opening gates
ever since 30c3

57
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:11,540
this year we have 42 mentors

58
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:17,300
and they are welcoming more than 200 mentees
this year

59
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,059
and it's amazing!

60
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:26,040
*applause*

61
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,330
check out one of 
the introductions that we got

62
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,740
and we got 200 of them

63
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,080
but we picked this one

64
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,300
because we liked it very much.

65
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,830
Carina: So, I am a 50+ female but...

66
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:49,150
*laughing*
*applause*

67
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,640
Yes, I might look young for that.

68
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,730
I am a 50+ female

69
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:58,450
but ad-networks keep categorizing me as a
25-year-old computer enthusiast.

70
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:04,540
At least they are not offering any
anti age products

71
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,930
Linus: And the beauty of the chaos
mentoring program is,

72
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:10,690
that most of the former mentees are now mentors
themselves

73
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,300
and I think this is what would be called exponential
growth

74
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,240
and that's usually a good thing.

75
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,260
*laughing*

76
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,500
So please welcome our chaos mentees!

77
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:33,250
*applause*

78
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:38,579
but our efforts for world domination are not
limited to Congress.

79
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:47,130
The CMS project reaches out to schools to
indoctrinate newcomers

80
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:52,739
and to recruit them as future hackers and
freedom fighters

81
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,899
Thanks for their efforts

82
00:07:54,899 --> 00:08:06,280
*applause*

83
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,190
speaking of freedom fighters

84
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:15,450
many of you are engaged in the freifunk community

85
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,940
and I am very happy to announce that
the freifunk community

86
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,680
has equipped almost 100 refugee shelters

87
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,479
with free wireless Internet access.

88
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:26,509
Thank you guys!

89
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:37,719
*applause*

90
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,539
But what's all this infrastructure worth

91
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:46,110
if it is not used to build sustainable
structures of empowerment.

92
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,730
And many of you maybe know the
refugees emancipation project

93
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,149
a team that builds Internet cafĂŠs in refugee
shelters

94
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:58,860
and offers computer workshops
for the people living there

95
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,269
for refugees by refugees

96
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:06,430
and many of you have supported and donated
to refugees emancipation

97
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,999
thank you for that

98
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:16,769
*applause*

99
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:21,230
Carina: This summer was a special summer
for a lot of us

100
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,670
it was the summer of the camp

101
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:29,219
we met in the middle of nowhere
to explore unknown territories

102
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:32,509
and live just for a few days

103
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:36,350
in our own perfect little world

104
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,739
some of you live this every day

105
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:45,399
and 27 local CCC chapters all of you
not only share the fruits of our work

106
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:48,059
but also the work itself

107
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:52,720
of course this is also true for Congress here.

108
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,070
Over 1000 angels supported this Congress in
the last year.

109
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,251
this year I am sure we will break this number

110
00:10:03,251 --> 00:10:13,079
*applause*

111
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,560
angels are visitors like you and me

112
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,780
they volunteer to do all the jobs which need
to be done to run Congress

113
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,050
they help you at the infodesk

114
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,289
they operate the cameras

115
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:28,849
they serve you Tschunk at the bar

116
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:33,959
and they even collect your empty Mate bottles

117
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,899
they do whatever needs to be done

118
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,829
even up to this moment

119
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:43,459
angels already dedicated hundreds of hours
of work

120
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:49,619
to create this amazing state
and this amazing space for us

121
00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:59,949
*applause*

122
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:03,920
And if things don't go well for once

123
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,829
maybe you have to wait in line

124
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:10,480
always remember: at the end of the line

125
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,769
an angel is working and he's working hard

126
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:17,259
they are doing this for fun and not for profit

127
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,099
so instead of complaining

128
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:24,449
take the chance and thank them
for their amazing work

129
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:34,689
*applause*

130
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:38,250
and you can always offer a helping hand

131
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,910
or even better become an angel yourself

132
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,559
go online, sign up, and grab some shifts

133
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,109
because Congress is a community event.

134
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,879
Do not come here to consume but to contribute

135
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,869
and to become a part of it

136
00:11:56,869 --> 00:12:00,619
just like a lot of people already are doing

137
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,749
this results in the Congress as we know it

138
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:06,119
with so much to explore

139
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:08,029
Next to the amazing lecture program

140
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:11,529
which I think most of you have already noticed

141
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:16,729
there are assemblies where people from around
the world come

142
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:18,079
and show their projects

143
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,559
they invite you to play with their toys

144
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:25,169
and to talk to them about what they have done

145
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:30,479
also there are workshops which cover
all kinds of topics

146
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:32,069
take part in one

147
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:35,589
and learn something you haven't
even heard of

148
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,759
or offer one yourself

149
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,919
everybody knows something
or can do something, others don't

150
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:47,769
information about workshops
and about Congress itself

151
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:50,699
can be found online in the Wiki

152
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:53,729
Linus: If you catch the Wiki
when it's not down

153
00:12:53,729 --> 00:13:00,479
*laughing*
*applause*

154
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:04,940
create an off-line backup please
- we are looking for one ourselves

155
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,230
*laughing*

156
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,160
with Congress being a community event

157
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,090
there is one thing that goes without saying

158
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,989
but I think I need to repeat it once more

159
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:24,260
leave your damn business at home

160
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:31,729
*applause*

161
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:35,419
I am sure your start-up is the next big thing

162
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:38,529
and there is a lot of fancy people
to hire here

163
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:41,819
and there is a trade fair for your amazing
business proposal

164
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:43,780
every other week of the year

165
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,460
but this is not one of them.

166
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:55,819
*applause*

167
00:13:55,819 --> 00:13:58,959
Carina: speaking of your business:

168
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:08,079
this year we changed the gender-based
binary concept of the bathrooms

169
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,609
The majority of them is simply for everybody.

170
00:14:12,609 --> 00:14:18,149
But of course we also think about our minorities

171
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:22,610
so if you can't handle the new more
fuzzy logic-concept

172
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:27,282
there's still some classic gender-based bathrooms
for you available

173
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:30,651
over the conference area.

174
00:14:30,651 --> 00:14:36,349
*applause*

175
00:14:36,349 --> 00:14:41,149
Speaking of bathrooms please wash
your hands regularly.

176
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:48,999
*applause*

177
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:57,620
viruses are a known threat to hacker conferences

178
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:03,410
Linus: but not only viruses
can bring you hell!

179
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:08,749
You are at an acute risk of resource extinction

180
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:14,689
so please follow the 6-2-1 principle

181
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:23,040
Get six hours of sleep, two proper meals,
and one shower

182
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,766
- and that is per day!

183
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:37,869
*applause*

184
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:44,279
And also drink more water.

185
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:50,459
you may have noticed this little logo
that we have here

186
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:54,879
with this fancy animation

187
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,369
and you have seen one before

188
00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:59,950
that had an even more fancy animation in it

189
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:08,799
and I know there is a couple of
3-D printers around

190
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:11,659
so speaking of new challenges I figured

191
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:17,239
that might be one for you.

192
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:18,959
with all that said

193
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,489
please be excellent to each other

194
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:27,639
become a part and not a consumer of this event

195
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:33,779
and explore the things, people and ideas
you don't know yet

196
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:40,759
Carina: let us together approach the new adventures
waiting for us

197
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,969
let us together master new challenges

198
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:48,229
and let us together make new experiences

199
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:51,269
we have not even dreamed of

200
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:55,759
let us together break the gates!

201
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,140
*applause*
*electronic music*
