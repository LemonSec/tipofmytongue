of musicians.5000:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,030I was born in West-Berlin in the 70ies,5100:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,759so I experienced the Berlin Wall and its Fall,5200:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,400yes, I was very involved in the techno and electronic music scene5300:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,220when it exploded in Europe via Berlin5400:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,800in the early 90ies.5500:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,539I don’t want to go into this for too long5600:05:51,539 --> 00:05:52,780but I basically have been involved5700:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,599in the production of around 400 releases,5800:05:55,599 --> 00:05:57,300worked with tons of musicians5900:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,830like Björk, Gary Numan, Rammstein,6000:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,530Primal Scream, Slayer, or classical musicians6100:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,759like The Brotzki Quartett,6200:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,639The music press calls me “sonic terrorist”.6300:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,439I toured with Nine Inch

90ies,6700:06:28,169 --> 00:06:32,229and I think you get the idea,6800:06:32,229 --> 00:06:34,599where we stand politically.6900:06:34,599 --> 00:06:37,319*some laughter*7000:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,310here you see Trent Reznor wearing7100:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,039an Atari Teenage Riot shirt…7200:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,599*laughter*7300:06:48,599 --> 00:06:51,370and here's a legendary photo of Aphex Twin7400:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,460and as someone on the internet pointed out7500:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,349in the corner there …7600:06:57,349 --> 00:07:00,569there's a mysterious person sitting in the garage7700:07:00,569 --> 00:07:05,330wearing an Atari Teenage Riot t-shirt.7800:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,039*laughter*7900:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,139For years I didn't even notice this,8000:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,300so, who was pulling the strings?8100:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,729In the late 90ies the Beastie Boys8200:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,610put out an album by Atari Teenage Riot8300:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,139called “Burn Berlin Burn”,8400:07:25,139 --> 00:07:29,280it went gold in the United States,8500:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,199the international release of “Burn Berlin Burn”8600:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,409was a slightly different version8700:07:34,409 --> 00:07:41,330and it was called “Delete Yourself”.8800:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,449So the last 20 years of my life were an absolut ride.8900:07:46,529 --> 00:07:48,810We're the collective, we try to9000:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,469stay off the grid as much as we can,9100:07:51,469 --> 00:07:53,419because we know about the dangers9200:07:53,419 --> 00:07:56,360of the music industry and its hype machine.9300:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,849It can swallow you and then it spits you out.9400:08:00,849 --> 00:08:05,909And most artists can’t get back up again.9500:08:05,909 --> 00:08:07,529So when I spoke to Thorsten and Erdgeist,9600:08:07,529 --> 00:08:11,669and a little bit to Frank,9700:08:11,669 --> 00:08:13,409they told me that they want me to speak9800:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,669about my approach to music today,9900:08:16,669 --> 00:08:19,819the political ideas and methods behind it10000:08:19,819 --> 00:08:21,069because they are very unusual10100:08:21,069 --> 00:08:24,680and have a lot in common with hacking.10200:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,870Usually musicians are inspired by other musicians,10300:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,969but we are inspired by hackers.10400:08:33,948 --> 00:08:36,900So, there're like 3 words:10500:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,229Atari – Teenage – Riot10600:08:38,229 --> 00:08:42,589I wanna play you a little clip from 199910700:08:56,990 --> 00:09:03,990*music: “Revolution Action”*10800:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,100Okay10900:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,780*applause*11000:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,030the video for the song “Revolution Action”11100:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,260was directed by Andrea Giacobbe.11200:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,530It opens with a shot of Wall Street11300:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,510and then the company faces a little11400:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,490… technical problem.11500:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,000This was in 1999 and it's maybe interesting11600:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,700for you to know, that MTV UK banned it right away,11700:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,200because they feared, that people would get11800:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,530epileptic fits or something like that.11900:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,550But actually MTV international did show it12000:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,330in many other countries.12100:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,420Over the past ten years12200:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,520the internet spread this video12300:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,600and – you saw an edited version of it now –12400:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,060and the internet is probably,12500:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,900where most people saw it.12600:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,550Atari Teenage Riot is not a band,12700:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,880that is often a misunderstanding.12800:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,300It’s more a lose collective12900:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,660of like minded musicians.13000:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,390What might be interesting for you to know is13100:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,830that we program every song on the Atari 1040 ST.13200:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,210*applause*13300:12:16,670 --> 00:12:21,770The Atari 1040 ST, do you remember this even?13400:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,920*more applause*13500:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,400Who doesn't even know this computer anymore?13600:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,620I guess the majority of you guys here.13700:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,560It has 2MB RAM, *laughing*13800:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,870it's always a fucking pain to make music on it.13900:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,090It's like solving a difficult math equation14000:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,260or something at our time.14100:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,690But it's great.14200:12:46,690 --> 00:12:50,070It has a very fast and tight MIDI attack,14300:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,030and every year that passes14400:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,880it becomes a new challenge14500:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,410to drive this little thing in the red.14600:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,680But it’s cheap also at this point.14700:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,670You know it's 20 bucks maybe on ebay14800:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,550or something …14900:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,070You can create art and beauty on a computer15000:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,380and – I always say this to musicians,15100:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,440who try to figure out like15200:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,820learning the skills of a15300:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,730“more traditional” instrument.15400:13:22,730 --> 00:13:28,180And you can also use music and art as a weapon.15500:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,890William S. Burroughs wrote a text in the “Electronic Revolution”15600:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,570about how riot sound effects can produce riots15700:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,030when you play them in a riot situation15800:13:39,030 --> 00:13:42,650you simulate a riot, people hear the sounds,15900:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,360they change their behaviour, call the cops,16000:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,260the cops appear on the scene,16100:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,330you have a riot.16200:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,410*some laughter*16300:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,410When we started in 199216400:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,750the far right and Neo-Nazi scene in Europe16500:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,660was on the rise,16600:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,130especially in Eastern Germany.16700:14:05,130 --> 00:14:11,890We knew we had to fight against that. With music.16800:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,690So we decided to make electronic music16900:14:14,690 --> 00:14:19,170on an Atari computer based on Burroughs’ text.17000:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,690Sampling technology was affordable at this point17100:14:22,690 --> 00:14:28,000and we created these tracks that were almost collage like.17200:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,260Back then the music scenes were pretty divided17300:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,700into groups like punks, ravers, metal fans,17400:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,220and the Hip Hop scene and so on …17500:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,570But our idea was to tear down those barriers17600:14:39,570 --> 00:14:44,000and unite people from all genres for the politics.17700:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,720Fashion, race, sex, social background and so on17800:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,940shouldn’t exclude anyone from joining.17900:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,610I still believe in this approach even though18000:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,200the music has to be adjusted from time to time18100:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,390to make this work!18200:15:03,390 --> 00:15:08,290Germany just celebrated the 25th anniversary18300:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,820of the Fall of The Berlin Wall18400:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,910and again we see racist and fascist ideologies18500:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,590spread all over Europe.18600:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,560Anti-Semitism, attacks on Jewish people18700:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,900and the demonisation of Muslims.18800:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,42020 years ago we hoped these problems would be solved by now.18900:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,530But they aren't.19000:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,670It's important, that culture reacts to this19100:15:33,670 --> 00:15:38,410and maybe even prevents this.19200:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,550The physical aspect of the music is very important.19300:15:41,550 --> 00:15:46,530Using frequencies that give the listener an adrenaline rush.19400:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,630When people hear music19500:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,220they often fall into certain patterns of behaviour.19600:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,280We have all witnessed this many times.19700:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,670You hear a christmas song,19800:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,160your brain switches immediately.19900:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,800Or when soldiers hear the national anthem,20000:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,200their body language changes very fast.20100:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,440Weddings, funerals, supermarkets, rock concerts,20200:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,440raves, birthdays and so on…20300:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,780Be aware of those, become immune to them,20400:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,810and you are in less danger20500:16:19,810 --> 00:16:25,100of being tricked into something.20600:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,650For those of you, who never attendend an Atari Teenage Riot show20700:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,820this is, how it looks like20800:16:29,820 --> 00:16:36,820*video*20900:18:26,750 --> 00:18:32,540*applause*21000:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,970The footage was filmed by visual artist Zan Lyons21100:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,990who was there to take some photos first21200:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,020but then switched to filming21300:18:45,020 --> 00:18:52,020when the crowd started to tear down the barriers.21400:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,430This was filmed at Fusion festival near Berlin.21500:18:56,430 --> 00:19:02,410It's a festival which is completely corporate sponsor free21600:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,320that we played in 2010.21700:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,590These things still exist and I think21800:19:08,590 --> 00:19:12,960it is important to support them and go there.21900:19:14,060 --> 00:19:18,710Last August we premiered a video at the EFF event22000:19:18,710 --> 00:19:25,710at Defcon in Las Vegas in the US, which was this one.22100:19:30,140 --> 00:19:37,140*music video: “Modern Liars”*22200:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,090“Modern Liars love machines,22300:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,780they get inspired and steal your dreams.22400:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,020The price of victory was never higher. …” *cont.*22500:22:22,560 --> 00:22:30,980*applause*22600:22:31,150 --> 00:22:36,520*laughing* I wish, I would have these comments during our shows22700:22:37,130 --> 00:22:41,530so people would know what to do. *laughter*22800:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,180In the video animated by Rob McLellan22900:22:47,180 --> 00:22:53,270we wanted to use a 90ies style video game aesthetics23000:22:53,270 --> 00:22:59,170to criticise sexism in video games, the entertainment industry23100:22:59,170 --> 00:23:05,550and how it creates stupid rivalries between creatives.23200:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,610You know, a few weeks later23300:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,100the whole Gamergate thing happened23400:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,950so we were slightly off time with this video.23500:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,920I think … little bit later,23600:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,070it would have been a good commentary, maybe.23700:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,250This was also an edited version,23800:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,900the whole thing is longer of course.23900:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,780I think the message is becoming clearer,24000:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,410if you see this whole thing.24100:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,870I often get asked by people from the hacking community24200:23:34,870 --> 00:23:40,100why is it that not more musicians participate or help?24300:23:40,100 --> 00:23:45,190Okay, people have maybe some friends who do some music24400:23:45,190 --> 00:23:50,630and … you know … but I think, we can all agree24500:23:50,630 --> 00:23:54,470that since that Metallica Napster fight24600:23:54,470 --> 00:23:59,650musicians and artists don’t really want to get involved.24700:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,870But I think they should.24800:24:03,870 --> 00:24:10,870Often people ask me ‘why isn’t there more protest music?’24900:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,510There's that triangle, that a lot of creatives use.25000:24:18,510 --> 00:24:22,929It's like high quality, high speed at low cost25100:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,200and you can never have the three …25200:24:24,200 --> 00:24:31,200It's just the reality of the creative process.25300:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,020Now think about what happens –25400:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,830and make no mistake about it25500:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,040because it is happening now since a few years –25600:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,230so what happens when you try to do it with zero cost?25700:24:43,230 --> 00:24:48,470It's almost like you're freezing culture.25800:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,679Now we could argue:25900:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,990If creativity is a resource, and compare it to fuel let’s say,26000:24:55,990 --> 00:25:00,550then it is limited and can run out.26100:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,610When there is nothing left to loot.26200:25:03,610 --> 00:25:10,610Decentralisation, but we are witnessing the exact opposite of that.26300:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,820Jaron Lanier often gets criticised for his view26400:25:14,820 --> 00:25:21,820and analysis of the situation, but he is right and it’s a fact.26500:25:23,950 --> 00:25:28,750This philosophy, this thinking, has led to a notch curve,26600:25:28,750 --> 00:25:34,320very tiny amount of people become very rich in this scheme,26700:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,850everybody else loses or is driven out of business.26800:25:37,850 --> 00:25:43,820It used to be more like a bell curve, more equal,26900:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,370fairer, it empowered the creatives,27000:25:47,370 --> 00:25:51,120it brought us the music we love.27100:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,250And all musicians creating music right now in the digital age27200:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,070depend on that second half of the last century27300:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,790for musical references.27400:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,020The era when recorded music flourished.27500:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,140So when then people say:27600:26:05,140 --> 00:26:09,670“Wait , Alec, we rode horses and then cars came,27700:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,800they were invented and everything got improved …”27800:26:11,800 --> 00:26:17,610I've never fully agreed with that comparison.27900:26:17,610 --> 00:26:21,730I don't think it really works here.28000:26:21,730 --> 00:26:24,820And you can really identify a con man28100:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,520when you hear him argue this way.28200:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,300It's just too simple.28300:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,080Because, if this was true,28400:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,090then the work of the greatest music composers in history28500:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,809would be shared the most,28600:26:38,809 --> 00:26:44,290people would understand complex music more and faster.28700:26:44,290 --> 00:26:48,350But the exact opposite is the case right now.28800:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,510Music education was the first that was cut28900:26:50,510 --> 00:26:54,290in most countries since the financial crisis.29000:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,040The reality is that young people today29100:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,030only hear something like classical music in a soundtrack29200:26:59,030 --> 00:27:02,440for blockbuster movies like Transformers29300:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,710instead of learning and understanding it via the internet.29400:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,140Even popular mainstream artists who make pop music29500:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,570can only survive if they enter into, in my opinion,29600:27:13,570 --> 00:27:18,880very compromising corporate sponsoring deals.29700:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,540Independent artists are doing other jobs by now29800:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,480and can’t take risks.29900:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,890In this system it gets harder and harder to speak out.30000:27:29,890 --> 00:27:33,820It is well known that if we look at the charts30100:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,740that the majority of artists are coming from upper class30200:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,900or upper middle class backgrounds.30300:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,290Even Noel Gallagher of Oasis pointed this out30400:27:43,290 --> 00:27:49,679in an interview with the BBC a few weeks ago.30500:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,190Many artists don’t like corporate sponsoring30600:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,960because it corrupts creativity.30700:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,290I think, they are right.30800:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,590Because once you enter these agreements30900:27:59,590 --> 00:28:04,240your mind just starts to think in a different way.31000:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,549Think of a politician who knows he/she took bribes31100:28:09,549 --> 00:28:14,340but acts in the media like he/she was ‘employed by the people’,31200:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,970and works ‘for the people’.31300:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,270So artists or those who work with artists31400:28:21,270 --> 00:28:26,720access culture funds, government funds, especially in Europe.31500:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,610We all know when libertarians, especially those from Silicon Valley, say31600:28:30,610 --> 00:28:35,640“We don’t pay people. Not our problem, let somebody else worry about that.”31700:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,929Well these companies are basing their businesses31800:28:39,929 --> 00:28:43,330on the tax payer repairing the damage.31900:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,700That is just a reality right now.32000:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,910So we have created a system32100:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,309in which we are not driving creativity anymore,32200:28:51,309 --> 00:28:54,530but by voting with our dollar, we handed that power32300:28:54,530 --> 00:29:00,010over to bureaucrats and corporations.32400:29:00,010 --> 00:29:03,470Those people don’t like to see political ideas expressed by creatives32500:29:03,470 --> 00:29:07,120because it could get them in trouble.32600:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,710I really want you to understand this32700:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,429because I honestly believed and I think many of you32800:29:11,429 --> 00:29:15,080believed the same thing 2 decades ago:32900:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,809We thought this problem was solved already.33000:29:18,809 --> 00:29:20,640Solved distribution via the Internet33100:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,809and the rest will work itself out somehow.33200:29:25,809 --> 00:29:27,890Maybe it was working for a little while33300:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,530but things got out of balance again.33400:29:30,530 --> 00:29:34,110It’s not so easy to point out the gatekeepers anymore33500:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,710in this more complex world,33600:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,460but they are out there and they are very busy,33700:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,950and they have adapted to our times.33800:29:42,950 --> 00:29:46,220When I started I strongly believed in this principle:33900:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,780Political art becomes corrupt when it's becoming part34000:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,920of a corporate ad campaign.34100:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,170The context matters so much34200:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,220that it can shut down an artist forever34300:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,000because we stop trusting their words.34400:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,870*video*34500:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,370(Julian Assange: I'm here to show solidarity)34600:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,390(with the occupy London movement)34700:30:09,390 --> 00:30:12,700(In our experience over the last five years)34800:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,750(the most frequent attacks on our organization)34900:30:15,750 --> 00:30:21,150(have not been, even by intelligence organizations)35000:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,770(or military organizations,)35100:30:22,770 --> 00:30:27,390(they have, in fact, been by banks.)35200:30:27,390 --> 00:30:34,390*music starting*35300:30:50,669 --> 00:30:57,669… “are you ready to testify” …35400:32:08,140 --> 00:32:11,290(Assange: People cannot wear masks in London)35500:32:11,290 --> 00:32:15,450(they cannot wear facial coverings in London)35600:32:15,450 --> 00:32:18,910(and that basic anonymity is denied to people.)35700:32:18,910 --> 00:32:23,809(I say, that sometimes it may be legitimate)35800:32:23,809 --> 00:32:27,230(to deny anonymity.

is from 2011,36500:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,400so we were going onto a US tour and36600:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,570we needed like a video and the video directors36700:33:37,570 --> 00:33:43,049that we wanted to work with didn't have time enough to do it36800:33:43,049 --> 00:33:44,760for the beginning of the tour basically,36900:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,809so that we have it ready, so …37000:33:49,809 --> 00:33:53,150we tried to do this typical kind of viral thing37100:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,690involving the fans,37200:33:54,690 --> 00:33:59,830but what was quite interesting is, that we got sent37300:33:59,830 --> 00:34:05,669a lot of these kind of clips by Anonymous activists37400:34:05,669 --> 00:34:11,730and we put up the first version of the video,37500:34:11,730 --> 00:34:16,230went on tour and in every city, we played in America,37600:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,260like about a week or two weeks after,37700:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,049there was an occupy protest.37800:34:22,049 --> 00:34:26,869I don't think, that we caused it, but …37900:34:26,869 --> 00:34:29,619It was very interesting to see38000:34:29,619 --> 00:34:34,079how a pretty boring idea in the first place38100:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,329became something that connected activists38200:34:38,329 --> 00:34:40,248basically on a global level.38300:34:40,248 --> 00:34:43,940This is also where I met most hackers38400:34:43,940 --> 00:34:48,248like from that scene, let's call it like that,38500:34:48,248 --> 00:34:50,418for the first time, you know, backstage38600:34:50,418 --> 00:34:52,659and it was a very exciting thing38700:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,799and then it ended up with the third version38800:34:54,799 --> 00:34:58,130that you've just seen, where we even got38900:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,349that footage from Wikileaks39000:34:59,349 --> 00:35:02,099and because it was a free song we thought,39100:35:02,099 --> 00:35:07,979‘why don't add this donation thing to the video?’39200:35:07,979 --> 00:35:14,680But then, a few months later –39300:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,900and I don't want this too long,39400:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,720it is a real long story and Quinn Norton39500:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,109did a great piece on it in Wired,39600:35:22,109 --> 00:35:25,589I think you can still read it online –39700:35:25,589 --> 00:35:31,369of course the corporate music industry reacts to that stuff.39800:35:31,369 --> 00:35:35,629And they are linked also, you know, to selling devices.39900:35:37,639 --> 00:35:44,639*video: Sony advertisement*40000:36:10,090 --> 00:36:13,119*some laughter*40100:36:13,119 --> 00:36:20,119So … no this40200:36:20,119 --> 00:36:27,119was aired on American televison in February 2012.40300:36:29,769 --> 00:36:33,640The thing is, they used our music, which …40400:36:33,640 --> 00:36:39,420you know, if you work with a publisher together, you kinda work it out,40500:36:39,420 --> 00:36:45,269the money comes to you as a composer or a band or whatever.40600:36:45,269 --> 00:36:51,130So what we did, to react to it, we donated …40700:36:51,130 --> 00:36:56,410it was quite a lot of money, I think,40800:36:56,410 --> 00:37:01,430to freeanons.org to the legal fund and …40900:37:03,830 --> 00:37:10,419*applause*41000:37:10,419 --> 00:37:14,609The thing is I kinda wanted to keep it quiet41100:37:14,609 --> 00:37:18,509and do it without any … publicity,41200:37:18,509 --> 00:37:24,779but the same weekend, that this ad aired on American television,41300:37:24,779 --> 00:37:27,239there were a lot of arrests,41400:37:27,239 --> 00:37:32,539so, of course, the Anonymous scene –41500:37:32,539 --> 00:37:35,829or I don't exactly know what you call it at this point –41600:37:35,829 --> 00:37:40,069a lot of people tweeted about this41700:37:40,069 --> 00:37:47,069and it was, kinda little win in that situation.41800:37:53,089 --> 00:37:57,029So, information wants to be free.41900:37:57,029 --> 00:37:58,220Music is like language.42000:37:58,220 --> 00:38:02,369There are so many layers of information in a music piece42100:38:02,369 --> 00:38:04,859that most of us can only understand a fraction42200:38:04,859 --> 00:38:07,859of what is communicated.42300:38:07,859 --> 00:38:12,119Before music could be recorded people wrote it down,42400:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,789so other people far away were able to play it.42500:38:14,789 --> 00:38:16,749I am still blown away by the fact42600:38:16,749 --> 00:38:19,660how amazing music notation actually is42700:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,569and has worked since centuries.42800:38:22,569 --> 00:38:26,509When you look at sheets of let’s say a symphony of Beethoven or Bach,42900:38:26,509 --> 00:38:31,349there is a beauty that some of us feel when we look at code,43000:38:31,349 --> 00:38:34,249that's what I was told by some hackers.43100:38:34,249 --> 00:38:39,849It is almost like something very deep inside of us43200:38:39,849 --> 00:38:43,400understands something before we can even explain that43300:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,130to a colleague or a friend.43400:38:46,130 --> 00:38:48,640I was always interested in the personality,43500:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,239the character of the creator43600:38:50,239 --> 00:38:53,690that would shine through in those works.43700:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,430Even when these were anonymous,43800:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,859the work could tell me so much43900:38:57,859 --> 00:39:00,460I could look at the world from a different perspective.44000:39:00,460 --> 00:39:04,519Like, I was looking through them.44100:39:04,519 --> 00:39:08,279Empathy is the key word here.44200:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,180For most people using the internet now44300:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,559it means defending your own world view,44400:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,690staying strong while standing in a shit storm,44500:39:16,690 --> 00:39:21,739reading articles or comments that just confirm your opinion.44600:39:21,739 --> 00:39:28,700Empathy is something that is hard to learn or to find right now.44700:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,619One thing, I just read a few days ago on Twitter and I really liked it,44800:39:31,619 --> 00:39:38,279was the statement from Tor about the bullying and all that stuff44900:39:38,279 --> 00:39:42,289and I think, to remind ourselves of that is so important.45000:39:42,289 --> 00:39:43,950Some people are so cynical at this point45100:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,279that they don't think it matters,45200:39:46,279 --> 00:39:49,180but I think, it really does.45300:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,979So it's well known that Mozart embedded secret codes in his compositions45400:39:52,979 --> 00:39:57,069that would link to the Free Masons, for example.45500:39:57,069 --> 00:40:00,309Music was always open, but you had train your ears45600:40:00,309 --> 00:40:04,369to decipher the information embedded in it.45700:40:04,369 --> 00:40:06,519When I wrote the little anniversary piece45800:40:06,519 --> 00:40:11,619for last year’s opening video, that we heard in the beginning,45900:40:11,619 --> 00:40:15,940I knew I just had to start with three C’s46000:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,339and, I have to admit,46100:40:19,339 --> 00:40:23,880it was the first time, that I ever did that.46200:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,809Usually children songs or christmas songs start like that46300:40:27,809 --> 00:40:32,099and in my world it's … taboo. *chuckling*46400:40:32,099 --> 00:40:39,099It was like ‘how can I make this kind of cool?’46500:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,890We all know that when different musicians46600:40:43,890 --> 00:40:49,690play from the same note sheet, they will sound different.46700:40:49,690 --> 00:40:50,369The better they are46800:40:50,369 --> 00:40:52,619the more their own personality shines through46900:40:52,619 --> 00:40:55,219and we can later analyse these differences,47000:40:55,219 --> 00:40:58,009e.g. with technology or software.47100:40:58,009 --> 00:41:01,710But what we can’t do is to predict those micro decisions47200:41:01,710 --> 00:41:05,619that an artist will make when creativity is happening.47300:41:05,619 --> 00:41:08,650Too many factors of the universe are influencing that process47400:41:08,650 --> 00:41:12,019and it's outcome is always different.47500:41:12,019 --> 00:41:17,180Yes you can copy somebody else, that is happening all the time,47600:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,259but every once in a while there are artists,47700:41:19,259 --> 00:41:21,150people who do something so special47800:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,859that they seize the time.47900:41:23,859 --> 00:41:27,690Historically collectives have suppressed those people,48000:41:27,690 --> 00:41:31,329because they did not fit in.48100:41:31,329 --> 00:41:33,450But I hear people saying like to me:48200:41:33,450 --> 00:41:38,829“But Alec, every creative act is just a copy of a copy of a copy.”48300:41:38,829 --> 00:41:43,059“Authors just write down what other people say,48400:41:43,059 --> 00:41:48,269painters just paint what the world shows them.”48500:41:48,269 --> 00:41:53,210We all have heard this idea in all its variations before.48600:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,999Especially when tech giants want to justify48700:41:54,999 --> 00:41:58,499monetisation of their users creations,48800:41:58,499 --> 00:42:03,900monetisation that just takes from their users without giving anything back.48900:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,759Instagram is a very good example for that.49000:42:07,759 --> 00:42:11,640And I keep hearing the same simplification again and again49100:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,049and it is dangerous.49200:42:14,049 --> 00:42:15,940Because it is an open attack49300:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,749on the rights and freedoms of the individual.49400:42:18,749 --> 00:42:23,239And when you question those ‘new’ business models,49500:42:23,239 --> 00:42:25,210the corporate PR machinery kicks in49600:42:25,210 --> 00:42:29,599and peer pressure is applied to shut critics up.49700:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,920In my opinion the fight for privacy, the fight against surveillance49800:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,809and the fight for creators’ rights have a lot in common,49900:42:37,809 --> 00:42:41,410they are linked, they are connected.50000:42:41,410 --> 00:42:46,009Authorities, corporate or political, who invade your privacy50100:42:46,009 --> 00:42:49,539are also the ones who seize the products of your mind.50200:42:49,539 --> 00:42:53,739That’s why open source and creative commons are great50300:42:53,739 --> 00:42:57,099because those who participate in those adventures50400:42:57,099 --> 00:43:00,099do it with consent.50500:43:00,099 --> 00:43:07,009In my opinion, sharing MP3s creates passive consumers.50600:43:07,009 --> 00:43:09,829I say share your whole recording sessions50700:43:09,829 --> 00:43:12,999so people can look at how the beats were programmed,50800:43:12,999 --> 00:43:15,559which combinations of notes and frequencies50900:43:15,559 --> 00:43:19,440trigger those feelings that you like.51000:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,150This way people learn and understand51100:43:21,150 --> 00:43:25,110and we can start moving forward.51200:43:27,429 --> 00:43:34,260*applause*51300:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,680When I started Atari Teenage Riot in 199251400:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,430I wanted to take the revolutionary spirit of punk51500:43:43,430 --> 00:43:47,979and digitise that so it could be transported into our time51600:43:47,979 --> 00:43:49,390and hopefully be preserved51700:43:49,390 --> 00:43:53,430so future generations could further develop it.51800:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,499When I use the word punk51900:43:54,499 --> 00:43:58,009I don’t mean a certain look, fashion or music genre,52000:43:58,009 --> 00:43:59,950I mean something that can be of course52100:43:59,950 --> 00:44:03,450found in punk fashion or the music genre punk,52200:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,710but I mean this virus52300:44:04,710 --> 00:44:09,710that makes people question authorities & control systems.52400:44:09,710 --> 00:44:14,849Usually universities don’t produce those minds.52500:44:14,849 --> 00:44:20,450But these minds are needed to bring necessary change or innovation.52600:44:20,450 --> 00:44:24,210I think the hacker world is full of those,52700:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,160but the music world?52800:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,729Platforms like YouTube and Facebook do not produce them,52900:44:29,729 --> 00:44:33,369they make it impossible for these minds to get anywhere.53000:44:33,369 --> 00:44:35,769The only interesting artists were those53100:44:35,769 --> 00:44:38,339who knew how to trick those systems,53200:44:38,339 --> 00:44:43,119fake stats, they thought like hackers.53300:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,489Introverts have created53400:44:44,489 --> 00:44:49,390some of the most important works in the history of mankind.53500:44:49,390 --> 00:44:52,700And introverts do not fit into that system53600:44:52,700 --> 00:44:58,229that has the goal to generate the most clicks in order to sell ads.53700:44:58,229 --> 00:45:00,940This system favours those who come up with the loudest53800:45:00,940 --> 00:45:03,499and most conformist content fast.53900:45:03,499 --> 00:45:06,450We can all sit back and enjoy54000:45:06,450 --> 00:45:09,729when things get even more absurd54100:45:09,729 --> 00:45:11,239but deep down we all know54200:45:11,239 --> 00:45:14,279that it is all very short sighted54300:45:14,279 --> 00:45:17,739and even goes against the hacker ethics.54400:45:17,739 --> 00:45:22,049To create art and beauty on a computer.54500:45:22,049 --> 00:45:23,979I always loved the phrase that I saw54600:45:23,979 --> 00:45:27,079on one of the Anonymous twitter accounts a few years ago54700:45:27,079 --> 00:45:29,779“On the internet you can be anything you want.54800:45:29,779 --> 00:45:32,630It’s strange that so many people choose to be stupid.”54900:45:32,630 --> 00:45:34,379*laughter*55000:45:34,379 --> 00:45:39,150I think, you've heard about this …55100:45:39,150 --> 00:45:44,219*applause*55200:45:44,219 --> 00:45:48,440But it's also true, like on the internet you can consume anything you want55300:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,400and it's strange that so many people choose to consume something stupid.55400:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,069And you can replace consume with produce55500:45:55,069 --> 00:45:57,619and it will also make sense!55600:45:57,619 --> 00:46:00,579Most creatives produce for a target audience,55700:46:00,579 --> 00:46:04,960an audience that is already defined by the content industry.55800:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,170It’s understandable that one wants to minimise any risk beforehand.55900:46:10,170 --> 00:46:14,009Netflix praised this when the series “House of Cards”56000:46:14,009 --> 00:46:17,089became successful with their viewers.56100:46:17,089 --> 00:46:21,259Critics say that its success had probably more to do with the fact56200:46:21,259 --> 00:46:25,279that it was based on the great original BBC series.56300:46:25,279 --> 00:46:29,869So not as innovative as Breaking Bad for example.56400:46:29,869 --> 00:46:31,859I noticed something interesting –56500:46:31,859 --> 00:46:35,249in the media and by talking to other people about it,56600:46:35,249 --> 00:46:37,849there was always that underlying idea56700:46:37,849 --> 00:46:42,329that the algorithms are so smart and precise at this point,56800:46:42,329 --> 00:46:48,099when they tell you you will like this, yes, you will totally like this.56900:46:48,099 --> 00:46:52,840And many people accept that without even questioning it.57000:46:52,840 --> 00:46:57,059So, are too many people becoming passive consumers again?57100:46:57,059 --> 00:47:00,479Like our parents generation?57200:47:00,479 --> 00:47:06,999High approval ratings prove that content is of high quality?57300:47:06,999 --> 00:47:09,229If we are honest than then we must admit57400:47:09,229 --> 00:47:13,009that most people make a judgement by looking at stats and comments57500:47:13,009 --> 00:47:15,069before they have read the article,57600:47:15,069 --> 00:47:17,880watched the video or listened even to the song.57700:47:17,880 --> 00:47:22,380While culture is becoming more fragmented,57800:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,630we see an even more centralised accumulation of power57900:47:25,630 --> 00:47:29,539when it comes to who is deciding over the future of the internet58000:47:29,539 --> 00:47:33,150and how the majority of average people use it58100:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,769or have access to it.58200:47:36,769 --> 00:47:40,690I know very well that I am speaking to probably exactly to the –58300:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,390I don't know how many people are here tonight –58400:47:42,390 --> 00:47:46,690thousands of people on the planet right now58500:47:46,690 --> 00:47:49,420who have not stepped into those traps,58600:47:49,420 --> 00:47:54,319you are very conscious about how you use technology.58700:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,569I am saying this to you because at this point one could argue58800:47:57,569 --> 00:48:00,859that we are all losing the war here,58900:48:00,859 --> 00:48:04,369even though some smaller battles are won here and there59000:48:04,369 --> 00:48:07,869every once in a while, but the bigger picture?59100:48:07,869 --> 00:48:10,859I think it looks dark!59200:48:10,859 --> 00:48:15,369I remember last year, the 30th anniversary, I couldn’t attend,59300:48:15,369 --> 00:48:17,329but I felt it on the other side of the world,59400:48:17,329 --> 00:48:23,259the Snowden revelations killed all doubts of what we’re up against here.59500:48:23,259 --> 00:48:25,950It was like a reality shock,59600:48:25,950 --> 00:48:28,079some even compared it to events like 9/11;59700:48:28,079 --> 00:48:33,429there is the time before and after you got hit with the news.59800:48:35,039 --> 00:48:40,369Everyone wanted to celebrate the 30 years of this great club and then this …59900:48:40,369 --> 00:48:47,369I admit I was depressed on a constant basis since the summer of 2013.60000:48:48,969 --> 00:48:52,209What depressed me most wasn’t the magnitude of the surveillance,60100:48:52,209 --> 00:48:54,150it was how I witnessed a young generation60200:48:54,150 --> 00:48:56,849that was so excited about democracy60300:48:56,849 --> 00:49:00,579and the possibilities to improve it with technology,60400:49:00,579 --> 00:49:03,390I witnessed how the spirit of that generation60500:49:03,390 --> 00:49:08,440was crushed within almost a few weeks, it seemed.60600:49:08,440 --> 00:49:15,209Hopelessness, cynicism and frustration spread like a virus.60700:49:15,209 --> 00:49:17,200But the worst thing was that indifference60800:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,999from most people out there,60900:49:18,999 --> 00:49:22,519people we really needed to mobilise those masses61000:49:22,519 --> 00:49:24,739who make the difference in the end.61100:49:24,739 --> 00:49:28,759To get the snowball rolling, turn it into an avalanche.61200:49:28,759 --> 00:49:31,959I didn’t even feel like I wanted to perform anymore,61300:49:31,959 --> 00:49:36,880our new album was finished, we were setting up its release,61400:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,509preparing videos, getting all the tools ready.61500:49:39,509 --> 00:49:44,249But the energy that everyone felt in 2010, 201161600:49:44,249 --> 00:49:49,359and perhaps even in 2012 seemed gone.61700:49:49,359 --> 00:49:56,359I think decline of the Pirate Party in Germany shows that, too.61800:49:57,039 --> 00:50:00,069In the first hours of when the Snowden story broke61900:50:00,069 --> 00:50:01,579I tweeted this:62000:50:01,579 --> 00:50:04,589“I’m surprised how indifferent so many feel62100:50:04,589 --> 00:50:07,420about the US surveillance scandal.62200:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,989Look up Germany’s history.62300:50:09,989 --> 00:50:11,219I have spoken to people62400:50:11,219 --> 00:50:14,819who lived in Nazi and Eastern Socialist Germany –62500:50:14,819 --> 00:50:17,599the spying on your life by the State is one thing,62600:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,049but what it does to your friends and family in the long run62700:50:21,049 --> 00:50:23,890is beyond anything you can imagine right now.62800:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,930You lose trust in people you love,62900:50:26,930 --> 00:50:30,769every conversation becomes half lie, half truth.63000:50:30,769 --> 00:50:34,170It becomes part of everybody's lives.63100:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,769Nobody is an exception.63200:50:36,769 --> 00:50:39,459So ignore music, games or whatever you do right now63300:50:39,459 --> 00:50:41,999and research the topic.63400:50:41,999 --> 00:50:43,239Anything you have said in the past63500:50:43,239 --> 00:50:46,529can be twisted against you in a surveillance state.63600:50:46,529 --> 00:50:48,109Made the wrong joke in ‘private’?63700:50:48,109 --> 00:50:52,749You are constantly being blackmailed by those in ‘charge’.63800:50:52,749 --> 00:50:56,349History has shown that these types of societies never last,63900:50:56,349 --> 00:51:01,489they get so corrupted with lies that many people will suffer in the end.64000:51:01,489 --> 00:51:04,469Everybody loses.”64100:51:04,469 --> 00:51:07,719That was in the summer of 201364200:51:07,719 --> 00:51:11,829and my words resonated with many people in the online community.64300:51:11,829 --> 00:51:13,910Even the Green Party contacted me,64400:51:13,910 --> 00:51:18,870asked if I could see myself somehow working with them.64500:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,149I said no …64600:51:24,149 --> 00:51:29,499*applause*64700:51:30,910 --> 00:51:35,640and actually let me make one thing very clear right now,64800:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,410if you are a politician and you wonder64900:51:38,410 --> 00:51:41,739why people are disillusioned with politics and don’t vote …65000:51:41,739 --> 00:51:45,689Yes, we don’t trust you anymore.65100:51:46,490 --> 00:51:52,889*applause*65200:51:54,149 --> 00:51:57,950And in these situations I can’t thank everyone in the CCC enough65300:51:57,950 --> 00:52:00,289for their hard work, commitment and passion.65400:52:00,289 --> 00:52:04,109Let me say this as a musician, and I speak for many when I say this:65500:52:04,109 --> 00:52:07,900People like us, we don’t understand every technical aspect of this stuff65600:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,390but what the CCC does sends a strong message65700:52:10,390 --> 00:52:12,959and gives people hope out there.65800:52:12,959 --> 00:52:15,709And that is very important right now.65900:52:15,709 --> 00:52:19,900The right of privacy is very important to creative people.66000:52:22,190 --> 00:52:26,249Culture can be a strong weapon!66100:52:26,249 --> 00:52:29,119Even though at this point most of the information was known,66200:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,229feeling the atmosphere together with likeminded people66300:52:32,229 --> 00:52:36,289in this old cinema in former East Berlin energised me again.66400:52:36,289 --> 00:52:39,950You know, Jacob Applebaum, he invited me to the premier66500:52:39,950 --> 00:52:46,950of the film “Citizenfour”. I don't know, if you've seen the film yet.66600:52:50,599 --> 00:52:53,930It's a great documentary and I think, everyone here kinda knows it,66700:52:53,930 --> 00:52:56,239but I wanted to point something else out today66800:52:56,239 --> 00:53:00,349When I sat in this packed cinema next to Frank Rieger and all the other guys66900:53:00,349 --> 00:53:02,599and the room was filled with amazing people67000:53:02,599 --> 00:53:04,239who deeply cared about this topic67100:53:04,239 --> 00:53:06,499and then Laura spoke to the audience and so on,67200:53:06,499 --> 00:53:08,349I was so glad that I did not watch67300:53:08,349 --> 00:53:14,529a crappy stream online, alone, in my cubicle.67400:53:14,529 --> 00:53:18,400So when things look hopeless, remember to use culture,67500:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,549bring people together, share time and space together.67600:53:22,549 --> 00:53:29,549Here is a photo of protestors in Tokyo during the Fukushima rallies in 2011.67700:53:33,099 --> 00:53:37,009It says “Anti Tepco Riot”,67800:53:37,009 --> 00:53:38,849so if you are an artist, be open67900:53:38,849 --> 00:53:41,160and let others develop your art further.68000:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,930It’s ok to let go sometimes,68100:53:42,930 --> 00:53:46,819if you disagree or something, just create new stuff68200:53:46,819 --> 00:53:50,799and move forward.68300:53:50,799 --> 00:53:53,160I was just told I have ten more minutes –68400:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,229damn, I really wanna speak about something68500:53:56,229 --> 00:53:58,589that happens to me with

artists started to speak out68900:54:08,459 --> 00:54:11,630against streaming services like Spotify.69000:54:11,630 --> 00:54:15,619Usually it is about royalties and I will not go into this too much right now,69100:54:15,619 --> 00:54:18,709it is clear to everyone who can do basic math69200:54:18,709 --> 00:54:21,829that these services are not the future business models,69300:54:21,829 --> 00:54:25,420because they don’t put any money back into the hands of the musicians.69400:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,339These systems can’t be maintained.69500:54:27,339 --> 00:54:30,499But I want to tell you my experience with Spotify.69600:54:30,499 --> 00:54:33,469So in 1997 Atari Teenage Riot released an album69700:54:33,469 --> 00:54:36,349on the Beastie Boys label called “The Future of

with a computer70300:54:53,150 --> 00:54:56,459when it comes to pushing the limits of sound,70400:54:56,459 --> 00:54:59,729connecting political lyrics with very physical music.70500:54:59,729 --> 00:55:03,660Songs from it still get played at protests around the world.70600:55:03,660 --> 00:55:07,009Influential music blog Stereogum rates it at number 970700:55:07,009 --> 00:55:09,359of the

Bundesprüfstelle to shut him up,72600:56:22,819 --> 00:56:26,849they argued that people of “caucasian skin color“ or something72700:56:26,849 --> 00:56:30,369are being discriminated against
