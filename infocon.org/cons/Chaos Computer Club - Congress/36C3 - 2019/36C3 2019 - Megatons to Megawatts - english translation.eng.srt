women military sure Goethe in energy on

11
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:23,810
band Lincoln that's ooh Julia hi who who

12
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:26,149
doesn't know it hands up who knows this

13
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:30,259
in the 90s when we showed these things

14
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:32,450
all of the hands went up but this is a

15
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:39,789
screenshot from a movie that was called

16
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:45,440
what exactly war games the movie is from

17
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:48,649
1983 and 1983 was the high period of the

18
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:52,009
Cold War and cobalt and the feminine

19
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:56,360
clear war was a real threat scenario

20
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:59,599
that people were experiencing in their

21
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,959
lives and they had constant fear about a

22
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:06,080
coming nuclear war and by the end of the

23
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:11,810
80s the global inventory of nuclear

24
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:18,380
weapons was roughly at 40,000 in Russia

25
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:21,020
and again roughly 25,000 in the US so

26
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:25,600
you can imagine that roughly 60,000

27
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:29,160
nuclear warheads in Sallisaw shadows

28
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:32,910
just waiting to be

29
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,450
sent out so in this movie wargames it's

30
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:43,920
about game theory and a mathematician

31
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:52,079
that is trying to not just go into

32
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:56,570
things like chess but also getting into

33
00:02:52,080 --> 00:03:02,190
scenarios for global thermonuclear war

34
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:05,130
okay and so very suddenly there was the

35
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,750
whole problem with the Cold War and it

36
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:12,630
suddenly wasn't really there anymore

37
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:14,880
after 1989 you know what happened the

38
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,990
the old Russia didn't exist anymore the

39
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,370
way it did before

40
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:22,920
and so the issue was that we suddenly he

41
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:27,660
had 40,000 nuclear warheads in a country

42
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:32,100
that didn't really get governed properly

43
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:36,170
anymore and was kind of broken at the

44
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:40,829
time and didn't have proper structures

45
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:43,440
they had in in the government that is

46
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:50,700
they didn't have protection strategies

47
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:53,430
for all of those warheads and and in the

48
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,399
yeah 91 there was an article in The New

49
00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:01,709
York Times where a journalist suggested

50
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:05,280
that what about if all of this this old

51
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:09,780
old state if you just bought all of

52
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:15,000
their warheads and looked into may be

53
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:18,988
using them degrading the material and

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,089
made it usable for a nuclear power we I

55
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,520
will talk more later about how that

56
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:26,580
would actually work this program was

57
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,870
called megatons to megawatts and it

58
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:34,200
actually existed it was between 93 and

59
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:41,690
2013 and the old Soviet Union actually

60
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:41,690
sold highly enriched uranium to the US

61
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:52,570
to transfer to convert into low-enriched

62
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:57,180
uranium from Pharma Russia actually used

63
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:59,680
this material and gave it to the yes

64
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:07,030
because they they had a lot left over

65
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:11,260
and 500 tons of this hu were converted

66
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:16,929
into burning material for nuclear power

67
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:20,409
plants and this actually led to 10% of

68
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:24,190
the entire electric needs of the u.s.

69
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:29,050
being covered by this program so this

70
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:31,390
was actually a very relevant amount of

71
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:34,000
energy it was not just a little thing

72
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:37,650
replacing one power plant but it did

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,910
make a big difference okay so I said

74
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,900
40,000 warheads in the US and 55,000 in

75
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:48,130
the u.s. I'm sorry

76
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:50,080
Russia was the farmer and so these are

77
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:53,440
this is the data for 2018 this is

78
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:57,580
roughly how much exists roughly 600,000

79
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:02,170
in the u.s. in in Russia and 6,000 in

80
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:04,539
Russia and 6,000 years so of course

81
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:09,550
there are others as well China is a

82
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:11,530
growing one that has roughly more which

83
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,080
was also impacted by the Cold War

84
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:20,200
Pakistan is also growing which it's its

85
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:25,090
own story we we have to wonder who

86
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:28,539
actually taught them there's another

87
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:30,580
topic there about the technology and the

88
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,550
knowledge involved and not just the

89
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,320
uranium or the plutonium the

90
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,900
proliferation is actually way more than

91
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,380
that

92
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:49,260
so in effect there's not just for sodium

93
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:50,909
and uranium in in words I'm gonna use

94
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,630
the world warheads instead of the German

95
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:59,160
version so there's also highly enriched

96
00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:02,580
uranium that is not actually in warheads

97
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:06,750
but in in storage the same is for

98
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:12,330
plutonium and I can explain this later

99
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:14,820
but it is mostly a side product in the

100
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,580
operation of certain kinds of nuclear

101
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:20,010
power plants and so a lot of this

102
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:25,979
material is actually available in

103
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:28,710
inventory and depending on what sources

104
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,910
one uses there's between a thousand and

105
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,440
five hundred two thousand and two

106
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:36,720
hundred tons of highly enriched uranium

107
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:43,469
that are lying around and between 200

108
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:45,240
and 250 tons of plutonium which is

109
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,030
available and could be used for this

110
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:56,300
which is actually what it's for it's not

111
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:58,830
very usable in other ways the principle

112
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,630
the principle of this is very simple you

113
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,729
take something which you can split up

114
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,409
something which you can fish something

115
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,810
for stopping the whole procedure and

116
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:09,030
something for for boosting the thing

117
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,890
there are multiple designs depending on

118
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:14,270
whether you use with plutonium over they

119
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:22,409
use uranium but they use boost things

120
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:24,210
boost things coefficient weapons are

121
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:29,010
usually not really exist anymore things

122
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:31,200
like big boy the person rushing through

123
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,330
spitting weapons there you need a

124
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,360
certain amount of suitable material a

125
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:39,120
certain geometry for the whole thing to

126
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,220
produce MA Newton's per ton unit that

127
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,240
it's used using it by itself and

128
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,240
therefore it's going up

129
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:51,030
for boosting you have the same thing

130
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:53,699
well it's just you have a ratio of about

131
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:59,760
one so the the amount which is used is

132
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:01,470
pretty much the Mount which is boosted

133
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,060
fission works with the addendum so

134
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:11,100
there's which is usually the terraeum or

135
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:13,410
tritium and these these mean that

136
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:17,190
there's not a central computer fashion

137
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:21,630
which is initiated so there's a there's

138
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:22,800
a little bit of a little bit of neutron

139
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,110
production which is started at the

140
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,459
beginning but it's not exploding up but

141
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,670
because because if you have more

142
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:31,710
neutrons which happens which I produced

143
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,120
them that is called be sufficient

144
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:37,010
because if you have no neutrons there's

145
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,010
no more reactions

146
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,260
that's usually what is what is also you

147
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,370
termed hydrogen weapons

148
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:47,370
so all these bombs usually have a

149
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,620
physics package that's the package where

150
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:52,620
there's usually all these all these

151
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:56,820
things inside on the left-hand side you

152
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:58,890
see a picture of so it's an old picture

153
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:03,510
because current pictures getting them is

154
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:07,949
pretty difficult because because it's

155
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:10,590
pretty difficult to get them if you're

156
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,600
taking the middle of the of the of the

157
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:14,010
left picture and you're going a bit to

158
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,470
the legs this metal piece that's the

159
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:20,370
physics package and the shimmer of this

160
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:23,220
can be seen on the right-hand side off

161
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,750
the left you see the classic atomic bomb

162
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,400
stochastic fission bomb that we've been

163
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,960
talking about and on the right-hand side

164
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:34,800
you have the the thermonuclear weapons

165
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:36,990
it's combined it's combined fission for

166
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,900
creating enough temperature in order to

167
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,550
stop the fusion process so you have to

168
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:45,300
splitting the fission as well as the

169
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:50,219
fusion the current melting and therefore

170
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:51,870
they have a bigger bigger power I think

171
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,160
I don't have to explain how efficient

172
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,430
actually works so in the principle you

173
00:10:53,160 --> 00:11:00,930
have a particle like a heavy heavy core

174
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:03,030
like something of number 90 or above and

175
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:06,390
on that you're shooting a neutron and

176
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:08,880
the note you can do multiple things so

177
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,980
it can either hit the uranium core and

178
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,340
get splitted and therefore creates

179
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,650
energy and putting materials and further

180
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,320
neutrons or otherwise it can't be

181
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:22,650
captured so there's a core in the middle

182
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,180
on that neutron hits and the neutron and

183
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:26,959
the core just takes the neutron and

184
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:31,469
becomes something else

185
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:34,980
the other number will change and which

186
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:40,170
will be mass number and other properties

187
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:43,580
and the new core as a result a new the

188
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:46,050
product of this reaction can have other

189
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:50,160
splits processes and can be split up

190
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:53,400
into other elements so it's something I

191
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:57,780
better - splitting or better better

192
00:11:53,400 --> 00:12:01,949
better plus radiation and as a result of

193
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:04,620
all of this energy is created and this

194
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:06,720
is energy is created the energy which is

195
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,450
created on top of the amount of the

196
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:14,130
splitting process is energy which which

197
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:16,470
drives the next splitting and in nuclear

198
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:19,920
power plant the rate of creating

199
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,990
neutrons - to start that the new a next

200
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,089
set of reactions is the same as the rate

201
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,980
which is used for studying this reaction

202
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:28,380
so that's the so-called criticality if

203
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:31,470
this criticality is above 1 you have a

204
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:34,170
nuclear bomb which if it's if it's less

205
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:39,270
than 1 or 1 it's a self limiting so

206
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:40,800
therefore it's over every every nuclear

207
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:43,650
power plant typically works at one point

208
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,240
zero zero zero and a little bit and this

209
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:47,280
is really why you have to where you have

210
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,260
to control the whole plant and you have

211
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:55,430
to make it stable by actually

212
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:57,720
so now I'm going to expend it with about

213
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,550
things so some natural uranium was a

214
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,060
mixture of different isotopes so that

215
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:09,599
you ran into 235 but it's mostly uranium

216
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:12,779
238 235 is only in choice tracer pieces

217
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,180
basically everything is created by by

218
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:20,310
splits by splitting it up by fishing or

219
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:24,420
by activation for for natural renewal

220
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:27,719
0.7 or more accurate 0.7 11% of uranium

221
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,760
238 and the Restless but almost all of

222
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,029
the rest of uranium 238 and a little bit

223
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,710
of other substances other other isotopes

224
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:39,540
of uranium it's not quite clear which

225
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:42,720
ones low enriched uranium Lu is slow a

226
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:46,469
small village uranium us has a part of

227
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,830
uranium 238 of below 20% and the rest is

228
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:54,150
usually uranium 238 highly enriched

229
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:59,190
uranium has a buff 90 percent of uranium

230
00:13:54,150 --> 00:14:03,270
235 and 30 days depleted uranium D U

231
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:05,910
which is less than 0.7 percent

232
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:11,449
uranium-235 everything which is less

233
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:11,449
than 0.7 uranium-235 is depleted uranium

234
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:18,660
[Music]

235
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:20,520
from from deer about the inverse GM you

236
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:25,860
can actually publish books and hold

237
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:26,850
whole presentations about is that so so

238
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,360
basically there's a whole discussion

239
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:33,060
about how how frightening this all is

240
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,530
weapons and basically weapons their

241
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,969
whole Arsenal's of weapons which are

242
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:38,189
created from depleted uranium because

243
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:43,350
it's kind of put used all the time by

244
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:46,560
nuclear power plants and yeah you can

245
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:49,589
basically use it a lot of the time as as

246
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,079
barrier-breaking ammunition and so

247
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:54,000
basically it's not it's usually

248
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,440
something you put on onto the waste and

249
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,420
leave it there and you need

250
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,680
and same thing you have for Putin him as

251
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:03,329
well so this is for example

252
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:06,989
weapons-grade plutonium it's a mixture

253
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:10,230
of plutonium 239 and attainment 250 40

254
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:13,650
usually bhutanam 240 has a has a weight

255
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:15,210
ratio of less than 6.5 percent

256
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:22,730
it doesn't want to spit that easily as

257
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:25,770
utonium 239 and therefore you need a

258
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,840
therefore you need a well and a bigger

259
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:31,949
part of plutonium 239

260
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:36,120
MOX is a as a fuel it's it's the

261
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:38,070
abbreviation for mixed oxide fuel for

262
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,790
that you can basically take as whatever

263
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:46,050
you want usually it's 95 but usually

264
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:52,589
it's a 7% plutonium-239 and ninety-three

265
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:55,979
percent natural uranium and it's not

266
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:59,130
just about the energy generated okay so

267
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:03,330
there are a big amount of various

268
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:07,050
nuclear reactor types they in general do

269
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:11,640
the same thing you did see the the

270
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:13,530
chernobyl movie by a very thick Asif he

271
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,620
explains really well what a reactor

272
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:19,170
actually is so there is burning material

273
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:22,350
that's needed you also need a neutron

274
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:27,380
Arabic a a moderator that breaks the

275
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:30,930
neutrons so they have a smaller

276
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:33,390
cross-section and then you need a cooler

277
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:35,250
that's something that actually takes the

278
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,510
heat to bring it to the turbine so

279
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,730
determined turns and generates

280
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,670
electricity and all of these parts exist

281
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:44,400
in any nuclear power plant in any

282
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:49,410
nuclear reactor and sometimes the

283
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:53,280
cooling system is different but in in

284
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:55,050
fact the the known systems are fairly

285
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,900
similar the the pressure water reactor

286
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:59,150
and the bottom water reactor are very

287
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,329
similar

288
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:07,629
and they work with low enriched uranium

289
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:10,490
and these mo X's and they can do is a

290
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:13,520
Canadian version is a Canadian

291
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,260
development that works uses natural

292
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,040
uranium the way it comes from the earth

293
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:22,069
basically you don't have to enrich it or

294
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:24,438
D reach it and can just be operated

295
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:27,949
directly with that and maybe also mixes

296
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:33,140
and then my my favourite reactor is the

297
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:36,830
RBMK it also it has a interesting

298
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:42,580
properties it is based also based on the

299
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:49,250
Cold War it is had been built mostly for

300
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:51,678
bridging gaps and it can actually have

301
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,090
its banning material replaced during

302
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,240
Operation you don't have to shut it down

303
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:59,750
and cool it down and then put it up back

304
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:03,490
up again but instead there is a crane

305
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:06,530
that can just pull the material out and

306
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:10,970
basically the with the system you can

307
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:14,470
automatically in operation use some

308
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:17,480
natural uranium or low enriched uranium

309
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:20,450
lower it into the reactor and depending

310
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:28,429
on how its currently running with its on

311
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:33,800
low low power you can depending on the

312
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:37,040
operational efficiency you can insert or

313
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:40,100
remove the burning material you can do

314
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:44,300
fission to produce energy or you can

315
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:46,070
breed which means that you can create

316
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:50,840
eternium from natural uranium for

317
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:55,730
example and then there is a there are

318
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:59,178
new versions in in the race which liquid

319
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:05,750
molten salt reactors let that work with

320
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:09,560
mixed oxides and more resource friendly

321
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:14,080
and but they're in effect also working

322
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:16,700
with these banning material systems and

323
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,939
then there are the liquid molten fast

324
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:24,830
breeding reactors that actually work

325
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:27,140
have a DAT vest here and they don't know

326
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,840
how I don't know whether it actually was

327
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:32,090
operational and then there's the

328
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,689
advanced heavy water reactor which is an

329
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:42,610
Indian development which is also liquid

330
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:48,590
molten salt and is also be done okay so

331
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:52,389
the fuel cycle that we get from natural

332
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:58,570
uranium which is mostly uranium 238 and

333
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:58,570
then by putting that into a reactor and

334
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:07,520
shooting it with neutrons so to say and

335
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:10,970
with a certain transaction in there that

336
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:15,670
can be used and then it will be

337
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:20,210
transformed into uranium 239 the the

338
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:24,950
molar mass changes it stays uranium but

339
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:28,580
the number changes and it changes from

340
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:33,470
to uranium 238 to uranium 239 and then

341
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:42,439
from there there are two various types

342
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:47,770
of better dissipation - so this is from

343
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:50,510
book this this this is actually has a

344
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:55,520
has a printing error it's not an O it's

345
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:59,570
an P so from the uranium 238 we are

346
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:04,610
breeding uranium 239 and then with beta

347
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:07,780
minus dissipation it falls down to there

348
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,780
is a no truth

349
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:14,040
and from this you can also initially

350
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:20,610
create energy and the same thing you can

351
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:22,590
also do futur iam so this is from a foot

352
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,949
this is called the fertile isotope

353
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:31,470
because it's you you can you can breed

354
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:33,120
the day and this was just actually which

355
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,860
is actually split up in the end by the

356
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,590
fission is not tore iam itself it's the

357
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:40,260
uranium which is created in the process

358
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:42,030
so so the others can also the others can

359
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:45,570
also produce energy but which what can

360
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:51,090
be efficient efficiently is the uranium

361
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:54,419
which is in there so one problem how you

362
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:57,120
can be like recycle it is to do with

363
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:59,220
this I will talk about this later so one

364
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,899
question is what what is the inventory

365
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:07,920
of depleted uranium what are the amounts

366
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:10,080
which are available so one idea could be

367
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:13,080
we can we can take the whole inventory

368
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,820
of highly enriched uranium and just to

369
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,490
down blending so we're just mixing it

370
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,689
with the depleted uranium and from this

371
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,970
we can create something which we

372
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,830
eventually can put into a reactor loi

373
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:26,730
for example could be created in this

374
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:28,919
path from this you can potentially drive

375
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:31,170
a reactor and produce energy so from

376
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,850
this you you have you have solve two

377
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,380
things at once you don't have the highly

378
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:40,320
enriched uranium anymore and you have

379
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:41,520
also soft the depleted uranium and I

380
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,929
mean the other things you can do with

381
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,400
the pre uranium is producing ammunition

382
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:49,320
but that mean it's it's pretty it's

383
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,860
pretty still very very active so this is

384
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,860
to the problem

385
00:22:55,050 --> 00:23:03,690
so yeah you need a lot of measures in

386
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:05,610
order to take care of this so to to have

387
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:09,930
a do back-of-the-envelope calculation

388
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:15,810
from 1350 tons of hydrogen rhenium what

389
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:18,450
can we do with it so depends a little

390
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:21,419
bit on how you want to create what which

391
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:23,370
type of an Lu lawyer you want to create

392
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,980
and depending on how many percentage of

393
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:27,419
uranium-235 you want to have in there

394
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,820
it depends a little bit on the directors

395
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:34,470
well so high pressure water reactor for

396
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:42,929
example from using that you have about

397
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:46,710
50 40 gigabits per day so the nuclear

398
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:53,820
power plant will PA will create about 40

399
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:56,720
gigawatts today which would be for an

400
00:23:53,820 --> 00:24:01,800
average power plant of about 1 gigabits

401
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:06,030
this is quite a lot actually so this is

402
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:09,600
just from this 1340 tons of highly

403
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:11,580
enriched uranium which which which are

404
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,750
from these warheads that we have been

405
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:17,340
talking about before there's more but

406
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:23,250
these are the numbers you can actually

407
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:27,000
find somewhere so actually uranium is

408
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:32,540
not the problem here the problem that we

409
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:35,150
have is actually the plutonium because

410
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,260
we have as we have seen before there's

411
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:39,840
we have seen before how much plutonium

412
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,070
there is around so this is now a

413
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,610
different source which has different

414
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:46,260
numbers because well I said before that

415
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,939
I can't really say how much numbers

416
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:50,790
about these numbers I can't really say

417
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,680
how much is around there but we are

418
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:58,440
always usually around between 200 and

419
00:24:52,680 --> 00:25:00,300
500 tons I would say that's usually a

420
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,040
pretty good estimate so the question is

421
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,110
what do we do with this patronum now so

422
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,249
so uranium you can just blend down you

423
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,488
can just use

424
00:25:05,249 --> 00:25:10,940
depleted uranium with it mix it in and

425
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:13,590
then we just put it back into a reactor

426
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,389
so we're just building ourselves new

427
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:19,978
plutonium with this however as we saw

428
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:22,199
before that's just what happens when you

429
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:25,289
when you use when you shoot your

430
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:28,080
neutrons onto uranium 238 then you get

431
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:33,989
uranium 239 it does to bitter decays and

432
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:36,769
then it gets you ready to Tony on 2 so

433
00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:40,470
it's basically a zero zero calculation

434
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:41,639
so just you're using warheads on the one

435
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:47,940
end but you're you're but you're

436
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:50,099
creating material for new warheads so

437
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:55,440
this is well this is a question whether

438
00:25:50,099 --> 00:26:01,168
once you do that so what do we do what

439
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:09,690
we need is some cycle which doesn't have

440
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:11,489
the uranium inside I said before that I

441
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,989
will that will say what what this

442
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:18,119
cross-section Neutron cross-section

443
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:19,950
actually is effectively a reactor

444
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:28,439
doesn't have nutrients of the same

445
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:33,539
energy so there's a certain probability

446
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:38,460
that an Neutron or for energy X will

447
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:40,109
will initiate a process of efficient and

448
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:44,809
this is really dependent quite a lot on

449
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:44,809
energy as you can see in the blue curve

450
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:52,830
which are which are actually high which

451
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:55,799
are oscillations of the coincide so the

452
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,720
problem is that if the neutron only has

453
00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:02,658
a little change in energy the reactor

454
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:05,170
efficiency changes involved so yeah the

455
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:11,260
fission there is

456
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:14,800
I'm the the family calculations are the

457
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:22,690
energies are roughly 10 to the minus 3

458
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:24,460
mega electron volts so that's down there

459
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:27,670
you can see mega electron volts

460
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:31,390
that's a energy amount for physicians

461
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:36,360
that work with very small energy amounts

462
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:42,010
that's a let's unit that we use that's

463
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:46,530
roughly a mega electron volt is a finite

464
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:51,970
in joules which is not always will be

465
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:55,210
for usage in in physics but mega

466
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:59,250
electron volts is the energy that we use

467
00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:02,920
on the x axis and on the y axis we have

468
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:09,910
something that's called barns a 1 barn

469
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:15,610
is roughly 10 to minus 24 square

470
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:19,570
centimeters which is a an area which is

471
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:24,550
roughly represents the area the the the

472
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:29,020
chance that a reaction occurs and barns

473
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:31,450
are the unit for that a barn is a

474
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:35,170
probability for a certain reaction

475
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:37,120
happening which is of course a nice

476
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:39,610
security by security feature because

477
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,179
what a barn is is not that commonly

478
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:45,090
known so what we can see here is that we

479
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:50,290
have a very big differences in

480
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:53,560
magnitudes between the rhenium to 838

481
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:58,659
and the things that actually interested

482
00:28:53,560 --> 00:29:01,570
for example the between atonium I don't

483
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:04,330
have a laser pointer right now but what

484
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:07,450
you can see is that it's not very

485
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:09,189
parallel some is actually way slower and

486
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:12,910
then there's a reaction and the

487
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:16,430
plutonium for example and if you imagine

488
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:19,810
that this mixed oxide that we have

489
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:24,430
and that we can use for burning material

490
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:28,310
made from yuning rhenium 238 for example

491
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:30,260
you can see that if we mix those we need

492
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:32,470
to have different zones and the reactor

493
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:35,840
where the Neutron levels are different

494
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:41,360
but which is difficult when to separate

495
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:43,370
them so it's different to it's difficult

496
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,879
to separate the red game and the

497
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:46,639
plutonium

498
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:50,600
because we have very mixed burning

499
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:54,110
materials so how do we do this that's

500
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:56,449
the reason for why this is hard so as we

501
00:29:54,110 --> 00:30:01,010
said earlier there is this breeding

502
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:03,440
process that happens which gives us the

503
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:08,240
rhenium 239 which we actually wanted to

504
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:12,080
have less off but so this is not an

505
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,990
option so as an alternative we have this

506
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:19,250
thorium cycle which is very interesting

507
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:22,610
because all of the thermal and liquid

508
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:25,130
gas reactors work with this so there is

509
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:27,919
already a lot of research into this that

510
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:30,200
has happened and a lot of these fast

511
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,530
breeders were developed and which is

512
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,710
actually pretty similar which is an wax

513
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:41,810
was slower and less energy dense

514
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:44,180
neutrons but yeah we can use these for

515
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:46,399
the things that we want to breed and

516
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,080
they they were used for breeding the

517
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,630
things that we needed a lot in the Cold

518
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:53,720
War for the highly enriched uranium that

519
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:57,320
and the plutonium that was supposed to

520
00:30:53,720 --> 00:31:00,110
be generated fall of the weapons so this

521
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:07,939
variant was actually very interesting

522
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:10,719
then and now we thought that in fact

523
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:15,620
when thinking about the thorium cycle

524
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:19,630
maybe we have a cycle where we can

525
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:23,049
prevent the regeneration of this element

526
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:26,410
so maybe can we insight off the thorium

527
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:30,010
cycle go in there and build a burning

528
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:35,799
material that uses the thorium and works

529
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:39,429
with it but also uses the plutonium-239

530
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:44,070
and also uses that and processes but so

531
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:48,160
we need a reactor that can do that and

532
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:50,409
that doesn't really exist so

533
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:53,020
theoretically we have to think about

534
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:54,970
maybe the thing we want to do is build

535
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:58,658
our own reactor type build a reactor

536
00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:02,650
type that could an ant effect dissipate

537
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:05,309
and use this plutonium which is very

538
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:10,120
difficult because the scattering

539
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:12,100
cross-section is in this weird area that

540
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,799
we don't actually want to use and it's

541
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:17,469
very difficult to keep this running in a

542
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,120
normal reactor these fast videos for

543
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:22,020
example work a little bit like this but

544
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,030
they're on a very way different scale

545
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:28,470
and then we would need so you have the

546
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:32,230
red curve that's the fast breeder that

547
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:35,650
is great for the plutonium and that's

548
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:40,030
where it wants to split but the the

549
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:42,940
pressure water reactors actually don't

550
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:46,000
really do anything in that area so the

551
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:50,730
plutonium just stays the way it is is

552
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:55,200
lying around there and the solution is

553
00:32:50,730 --> 00:33:00,940
is already shown in here as another

554
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:02,860
shortcut it's this dmsr so yesterday i

555
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:06,039
thought about it with some colleagues

556
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:11,020
and we were thinking about it had some

557
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:13,510
thought experiments about without going

558
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:15,639
into technical detail just like what

559
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,679
would we see theoretically need to build

560
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,149
this

561
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:20,490
and theoretically we would need a

562
00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:24,209
reactor where we can have various

563
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:26,899
Neutron temperatures in there so we can

564
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:29,970
have reactions with higher energies and

565
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:32,428
also the ones with low energies and so

566
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:35,309
there is no really no actual reactor

567
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:38,309
that where this is all similar so this

568
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:40,940
is actually controllable and surprised

569
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:45,119
this is actually done

570
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:48,570
so these GMS our reactors are a new idea

571
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:51,590
for how to build these reactors and when

572
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:54,570
one thinks about how to build these

573
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:56,908
you'd have to think about how all of the

574
00:33:54,570 --> 00:34:03,168
the different core loading operations

575
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:06,539
happen and so you just use em cmp but

576
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:10,950
these reactors were actually a lot of

577
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:16,290
different fuel types are used they

578
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:19,500
already exist and the the one one of the

579
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:21,089
reactors the the lean reactor actually

580
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,549
has the same problem there they were

581
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:26,460
built in a time where highly enriched

582
00:34:23,549 --> 00:34:28,379
uranium wasn't really a problem where we

583
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:31,349
just had lots of it and just threw it

584
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:34,139
into the reactor but nowadays it's this

585
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:37,260
is just not done anymore because all of

586
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:40,049
these burning rods are lying around in

587
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,849
cellars and becoming an issue so we

588
00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:45,569
don't want to have this weapons-grade

589
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:48,510
nuclear material lying around so this is

590
00:34:45,569 --> 00:34:59,308
a security issue as well as a a nuisance

591
00:34:48,510 --> 00:35:01,680
oh all right all right so this this

592
00:34:59,309 --> 00:35:03,990
problem exists so how can we build a

593
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:08,009
reactor where we can have all of the

594
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:11,930
highly enriched uranium and use it in

595
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:15,240
just these few rods that are used for

596
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:20,399
highly enriched uranium so some

597
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:23,399
simulations with on with this NC NP

598
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,670
system which is used for Neutron

599
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,770
simulations so you just built your

600
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,950
reactor and then

601
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:32,720
you think a lot about which banning rods

602
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:34,759
should be we're way which reflectors

603
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,379
should be where and all of the other

604
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:41,600
building parameters and just rebuild it

605
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:44,330
so this is a trigger actor where we're

606
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,700
thinking about whether replacing one of

607
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:50,029
these burning rods with something that

608
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:52,490
is less highly enriched and that's

609
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:57,020
exactly what one has to do with these

610
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:59,299
thorium and plutonium mixed cores so the

611
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:04,390
solution is that in the middle you

612
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:06,680
create an area where the neutrons are

613
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:09,220
working with way higher energies and

614
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:11,930
then towards the borders to the

615
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:15,169
boundaries of the reactor they have

616
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:23,149
smaller energies and then theoretically

617
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:25,610
we can burn our plutonium 239 okay but

618
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:33,620
the problem is what kind of a reaction

619
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:36,760
is that it splits but it doesn't just

620
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:40,330
create it's it's its parts there's

621
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:44,830
things that are created when splitting

622
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:50,540
which we can see on the x-axis but also

623
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:54,610
what happens is that comes with this is

624
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:58,190
that we are also producing plutonium 240

625
00:36:54,610 --> 00:37:00,770
which is the x-axis why there is years

626
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:02,750
so this is the amount of years that this

627
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:07,280
reactor would have to run for the

628
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:11,060
plutonium to actually dissipate and this

629
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:15,170
is what it would take to actually use

630
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:20,450
fission to dissipate this this petroleum

631
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:21,950
and so why by using this kind of reactor

632
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:23,480
we are actually producing a different

633
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:26,419
kind of plutonium and we have the same

634
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:29,650
problem as before so this doesn't really

635
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:32,360
help it's not as splittable as

636
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:36,050
plutonium-240 so it's not as usable for

637
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:38,000
weapons but it is it's ready ating just

638
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:40,970
as much and still just as much as a

639
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,300
problem in terms of its half-life

640
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:47,450
so the the even the weapon rape lutonium

641
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:50,150
can be removed and used for energy

642
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:53,480
protection but it still produces other

643
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:55,819
problems and I don't really know if

644
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:01,400
bhutanam 240 is actually a lot better

645
00:37:55,819 --> 00:38:03,800
than 239 so this it is kind of an

646
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,069
advantage but doesn't really make a

647
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:11,900
difference so the the waste economy

648
00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:16,060
there is just a creating new waste which

649
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:18,950
we already discussed at the last camp

650
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:22,009
where we talked about the energy sources

651
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:24,980
per kilowatt hour and the the waste is

652
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:28,700
never really used in any of those power

653
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:30,530
calculation costs is factored in what

654
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:35,509
the what the disposal of the waste

655
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:38,180
actually costs so plutonium-240 is not

656
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:40,369
that much better than 239 in terms of

657
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:43,368
proliferation it's probably better but

658
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:47,630
in terms of waste it's just as bad so

659
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:52,190
what what would we do with this it's a

660
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:55,970
kind of a sad thing to think about so

661
00:38:52,190 --> 00:39:03,140
when we look at it we see this megatons

662
00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:05,359
to megawatts program but it's it's not

663
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,859
actually in such a way it was not

664
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,440
successful in such a way that the

665
00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:11,540
inventory of these materials has

666
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,510
actually gone down and when one looks at

667
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:17,210
China and for example in India you can

668
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:21,710
see that they are actually widening

669
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:27,440
their nuclear arsenals and not reducing

670
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:29,599
them and then there's this theory that a

671
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,819
lot of nuclear power reactors are

672
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:35,390
actually just running there to produce

673
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:38,750
more plutonium which of course only

674
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:41,270
works breeding reactors but that's you

675
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,500
can buy this of course but then there

676
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:44,270
are other countries that don't actually

677
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:51,050
want to give this away because it's kind

678
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:53,450
of a power issue so I think in the end I

679
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:54,800
would rather play chess or go instead of

680
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:58,120
participating in this global

681
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:02,690
and I don't think that this is a a

682
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:04,580
sacrifice that we should make so this

683
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:08,750
should maybe be discussed in a different

684
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:12,680
context but it will probably go into too

685
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:17,710
much detail for for now this was of

686
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:20,450
course just a very superficial overview

687
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:27,200
but this is roughly how it could work

688
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:30,109
thank you that's all this talk was

689
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:34,069
translated by the c3 lingo talking to

690
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:35,810
you were Oscar and M asam you can leave

691
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:38,170
feedback about our translation on

692
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:41,509
Twitter at c3 lingo under the hashtag

693
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:43,900
c3t we will continue with the questions

694
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,900
next

695
00:40:55,570 --> 00:41:06,200
right now there's a system sealing talk

696
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:07,370
about the waste problem I want to talk

697
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,350
about two things

698
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:12,950
one is the whole thing of the nuclear

699
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:18,470
waste and with this you can also really

700
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:24,169
fill ours yeah not just talking other

701
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:32,419
than the nuclear context so I of course

702
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:34,550
I'm totally biased towards well I'm

703
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,410
saying and saying it realistically it's

704
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:37,310
not the best energy form I mean

705
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:42,319
especially when you're talking about

706
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:44,930
things like like waste so the question

707
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:48,200
really is what are we optimizing are we

708
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:49,370
optimizing - what's cheapness what's not

709
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:58,250
a lot of co2

710
00:41:49,370 --> 00:42:00,319
- what's waste the at an exciting topic

711
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:03,490
you can think about atomic energy what

712
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:05,740
you want but we should stick with atomic

713
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:08,629
dissolve and there were one opinion

714
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:09,049
microphone number one yeah thanks for

715
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:13,400
the

716
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:16,600
my question is the highly enriched

717
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:19,490
uranium wasn't in which at some point

718
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:22,150
couldn't you like spread it somehow so

719
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:25,120
that it isn't enriched anymore

720
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:30,020
what are you meaning by a distribute

721
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:33,259
well only small amounts and very lightly

722
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:36,710
spread so it's like no whisk for the

723
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:39,320
environment something like neutral

724
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:44,570
rhenium in the end well that's that

725
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:47,470
existed isn't the earth so depleted

726
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:49,700
uranium and enriched uranium is kind of

727
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:52,129
really makes the same thing it's only

728
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:54,640
about then the mixture of isotope

729
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:56,570
numbers it's about having more

730
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,160
uranium-235 and the highly enriched

731
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:01,130
uranium was done alone which you may

732
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,629
know so basically yeah you're really

733
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:04,850
doing the same thing if you're if you're

734
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:06,500
down blending you're using the highly in

735
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:11,420
virtue anyone the depleted uranium in a

736
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:13,490
mixing them as a result yeah well in the

737
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:17,570
end and the reactor you're you're not

738
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:18,680
really destroying well when you're

739
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,660
enriching you're not really destroying

740
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,779
isotopes or creating anything you're

741
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:25,190
just just changing the order you're just

742
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,710
taking of centrifugal then you're

743
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:29,240
splitting it up into different pieces

744
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:31,460
different it's just it's just a change

745
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,799
of it's just separation by mass and of

746
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:37,910
course you can mix it in the end so

747
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:39,170
that's simply what you can mix it so

748
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:42,069
basically what you're doing is you're

749
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:46,700
just taking the uranium from the earth

750
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:48,440
and then you're and which enriching it

751
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,240
and I mean theoretically you could cut

752
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:54,020
back could put it back into the earth

753
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:56,149
and it would be the same as before so

754
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:59,600
roughly at least it's the whole works

755
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:01,510
and exactly but roughly yeah the

756
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,690
question would be why don't they do this

757
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:08,570
yeah it's yeah we could I mean if you

758
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:11,060
did this megatons to megawatts also

759
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:13,460
follow a program

760
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:15,020
yeah the proponents say that not every

761
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:20,080
country wants that the day uranium is

762
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:23,660
gone all the countries are wants want to

763
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:25,970
get rid of all the great uranium they

764
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:28,850
have in their inventory and blend it

765
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:30,200
down and get rid of it so I mean they

766
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:33,319
are they could be could do it if it was

767
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:37,040
possible yeah thanks question from the

768
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:40,280
internet yeah it's a really odd amount

769
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,900
of questions and it's about age where do

770
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,850
we can where can we put the heat and

771
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:47,600
we'll attach effort on the environment

772
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:50,509
of warming and what is just one question

773
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:53,210
after another yeah it's one topic

774
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:56,440
environmental heating global heating so

775
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:56,440
I haven't really thought about this

776
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:03,140
haven't really thought about whether the

777
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:06,020
global warming create well the warming

778
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:07,609
created by burning nuclear fuel any

779
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,090
contribution to the global warning with

780
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:11,240
the earth

781
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:13,580
I don't think about this I will I will

782
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:16,330
sit down tomorrow and then we'll do some

783
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:19,190
some back of the envelope considerations

784
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:21,410
yeah I will have a catch Justin football

785
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:23,630
and some other people want to contribute

786
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:26,839
they're very very welcome to do so

787
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:28,850
be my guest yeah the question is of

788
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,530
course very interesting I don't know I

789
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:34,900
don't know I have asked me again

790
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:34,900
tomorrow what was the second question

791
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:46,040
yeah what proportion of the division and

792
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:48,230
fusing of yeah have some we have some

793
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:52,779
things and some prototypes for fission

794
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:55,010
reactions so there are some ideas about

795
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:58,040
something we could use for for height

796
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:59,480
for using hydrogen bombs basically

797
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,090
fusion efficient are basically roughly

798
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,590
speaking the same thing they're just

799
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:07,580
just going in different directions it's

800
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:08,960
because of the the mass effect and the

801
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:12,650
stability of the mass effect depending

802
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:15,190
of the other number and the energy

803
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:19,190
difference between the core as a whole

804
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:21,770
and the sum of all the parts basically

805
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:23,290
like the bit the binding energy of the

806
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:26,290
of the core nuclear

807
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:27,880
and that's basically what gets free when

808
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:29,620
you're splitting up the energy or

809
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,480
respectively the energy which is freed

810
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:35,350
when you are when you're when you're

811
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:38,350
merging the course and basically you can

812
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:40,330
you can have fission releasing energy

813
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:41,980
for potent numbers above 90 that's when

814
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:43,450
it starts to get interesting and that

815
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:46,690
energy which is released from binding

816
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:49,390
energy of the course must affect what is

817
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:51,400
called I said yes thank you

818
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:54,759
yeah thanks microphone number three

819
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:59,890
there's someone waiting okay I don't

820
00:46:54,760 --> 00:47:03,280
know if this fits to your topic but what

821
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:05,920
do you think what should change in a

822
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,410
satiety manner so that project like

823
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,450
megatons to megawatts continued or maybe

824
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:17,700
have succeeding projects and are set up

825
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:20,339
in other language countries no Balea

826
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:22,750
right now we have a pretty peaceful

827
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:27,400
Society you don't really have a peaceful

828
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:29,050
Society was well without what we don't

829
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,570
really need the hydrogen bombs or atomic

830
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:36,820
bombs and before before we don't really

831
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:38,110
have a peaceful society so so the

832
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,760
question is maybe there are financial

833
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:45,520
interests of the megatons to megawatts

834
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:47,530
program was not really for reducing the

835
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,300
amount of lack of weapons it wasn't

836
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:51,730
really for for that even smaller

837
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:54,460
financial interest it was really the

838
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:56,680
idea to get very cheap uranium and at

839
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:58,510
the same time of course our previous

840
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,490
enemy also gets rid of all Italian which

841
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:05,770
you may know but overall it really was

842
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:07,410
about money yeah I think microphone

843
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:12,700
number two was next

844
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:16,330
she had one question it yeah people say

845
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:19,419
that the term cycle is like the most

846
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:24,040
interesting thing and it's like neutral

847
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:26,800
neutral and more or less secure nuclear

848
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:29,210
technology is that white

849
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:33,080
it depends a bit on the company which

850
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:36,350
builds the reactor this my honest answer

851
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:39,259
it depends on the country which puts up

852
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:40,970
the reactor because they have a lot of

853
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:43,520
influence on how the reactors build

854
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:48,379
houses safely it is build where how it

855
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:50,210
is push whether you have systematic

856
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:53,120
problems in building the reactor

857
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:55,840
if I could add wasn't just one of the

858
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:58,520
point about liquid crystal reactors that

859
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:00,140
the liquid crystal needs to be pumped

860
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,670
through the director all the time and if

861
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:08,029
there's a power loss then we have a

862
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:11,140
problem yes well I think we just need to

863
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:13,220
think a bit more about the technology

864
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:16,069
basically if you look at the normal

865
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:20,209
pressure water reactor we also needed 50

866
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:22,940
years how we finally got to non so how

867
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:24,620
we make them inherently safe basically

868
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:26,810
how it so the idea about this is that

869
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:31,370
the physics really turns off the reactor

870
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:33,640
if and yes so for example the thing gets

871
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:36,560
hot the reactor gets hot therefore the

872
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:38,180
the the efficiency of the reactor goes

873
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,600
down I mean we didn't really know this

874
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:44,799
50 years ago it's it's yeah the

875
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:47,860
technology was developed over time I

876
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:51,410
have to say that such reactors are not

877
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:53,120
really my specialty so I have a rough

878
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:56,000
idea how they work but they don't even

879
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:57,410
know whether the technology is far

880
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,380
enough that that all these details have

881
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:03,589
been figured out I think if you really

882
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:05,810
have to build reactors one should build

883
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:08,600
the newest generation pressure water

884
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:13,970
reactors in countries which are which

885
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:17,720
are thinking about safety not in

886
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:22,359
countries like I don't really want to

887
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:25,100
talk about this thank you I think that

888
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:29,480
there's no mic remember I'd put is quite

889
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:34,310
dark and anonymous hello yeah I am quite

890
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:40,160
shocked to have a talk that is as far as

891
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:44,089
understood promotes - yeah an enhancer

892
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:45,950
use it up at home energy excuse me I

893
00:50:44,089 --> 00:50:50,299
really this triggers me completely

894
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:52,819
because I just got I just had to add

895
00:50:50,299 --> 00:50:57,470
listed the same thing on the under under

896
00:50:52,819 --> 00:51:00,980
my electron decamp yeah I just could go

897
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:02,689
near by accident please please can you

898
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:08,539
maybe look at the at the recording of

899
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:11,089
the camp but maybe you could listen to

900
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:13,010
your opinion once because I'm missing a

901
00:51:11,089 --> 00:51:16,099
statement what your opinion is on that

902
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:18,619
topic and I'd interestin that so this

903
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:21,380
was not really the topic of of this talk

904
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:23,210
so the topic of of the other talk at the

905
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,319
camp so we're we really just talked

906
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:26,150
about it so the question is really what

907
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:30,109
do you want to optimize you want to talk

908
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:33,619
for of cheap power or co2 neutral power

909
00:51:30,109 --> 00:51:36,259
at least very little off of ways there

910
00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:39,109
are a couple of parameters which ones do

911
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:45,260
you really want to optimize for do we

912
00:51:39,109 --> 00:51:48,259
have three minutes so now Germany is an

913
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:49,930
organism which keeps the power which

914
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:53,150
this gets the power mostly from coal

915
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:55,629
power plants so solar and winds we also

916
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:59,510
have and water energy also exists so

917
00:51:55,630 --> 00:52:05,150
Germany needs about 51 terawatt-hours of

918
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:08,630
per per year so organisms Germany needs

919
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:10,430
about 51 several dollars per year so

920
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:11,990
whatever we cannot really extend any

921
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:14,118
more because there is just not enough

922
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:15,520
water where we can store this energy so

923
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:18,260
we can't we don't really have a lot of

924
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:21,288
space to play around there so if you

925
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:24,980
want to optimize only towards co2

926
00:52:21,289 --> 00:52:28,220
neutrality and price so then the

927
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:30,470
question is how much cents per kilowatt

928
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:34,129
to water power and coal power and all

929
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:37,819
these things cost so then we just add

930
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:42,740
the all these costs and then we compute

931
00:52:37,819 --> 00:52:45,079
how much co2 exhaust all these different

932
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:47,629
powers have and then we just make a very

933
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:49,789
simple linear optimization looking at

934
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:50,970
all these parameters just based on these

935
00:52:49,789 --> 00:52:54,510
facts

936
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:59,100
Denikin's there are some constraints so

937
00:52:54,510 --> 00:53:03,840
for example sticker sticks and nitrous

938
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:07,290
oxides for example another constraint

939
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:08,520
could be that that one Kansai could be

940
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:11,990
that we just have a certain amount of

941
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:14,820
energy we can get from water power and

942
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:18,240
if you just do this optimization you get

943
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:19,980
a solution which which just says nuclear

944
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:24,089
power with what we want is simply

945
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:25,890
appalled so it's not completely neutral

946
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:29,370
with it comes to neutrals oxides for

947
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:31,259
example so for example water it's not

948
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:32,880
completely neutral to neutral object

949
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,620
because if you remove the water and it

950
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,300
gets free then there's some sense it's

951
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,529
offsets release but if you look at all

952
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:41,720
these facts in the optimizing to my

953
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:41,720
surprise and see your two neutrality and

954
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:46,800
so I can't believe fold these figures

955
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:49,590
now but please look at the recording and

956
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,390
that's why we said about I talked about

957
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:55,680
this so basically yeah from this the

958
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:57,210
solution is nuclear power so it but but

959
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,100
what I want to stress here it's about

960
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:03,120
when it's good when it's made when it's

961
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:05,279
done good yeah I'd like to add but

962
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:09,569
please no comments we are switching to

963
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:13,110
microphone number two I will be near

964
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:14,570
sweetie later so please just just talk

965
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:16,650
to me there I'll talk to me on Twitter

966
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:19,830
contact me on Twitter I'm very happy to

967
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:22,140
meet Evan and continue discussion if I

968
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:24,779
understood it right I can make from a

969
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:29,339
neutron and geo Internet 38 something

970
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:32,730
splittable in the caster is then his

971
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:37,370
mode isn't there mostly to Anu and 238 I

972
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:39,690
honestly don't know I don't know maybe

973
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:42,529
yeah I think there was one of the main

974
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:45,180
points that yeah it has a high

975
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:49,400
deterioration time and we can like store

976
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:54,500
it in that way no no okay

977
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:54,500
so the problem with uranium 238 is that

978
00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:01,730
so we the problem is we're getting

979
00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:03,650
polonium 239 from this but this is not

980
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:06,020
suitable in a normal conventional high

981
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:07,840
pressure water reactor you're needed

982
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:11,540
with these high-temperature reactors

983
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:14,480
these these liquid salt molten salt

984
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:15,800
reactors for example these high

985
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,720
temperatures which you don't really have

986
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:20,630
in the standard reactors that we have

987
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:26,750
these days in the normal boiling water

988
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:28,280
reactor but the problem is those those

989
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:30,140
kind of reactors fatigue this most of

990
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:34,600
the time can't really use these

991
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:36,770
plutonium based power put on best fuel

992
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,540
so on the other problem is that you want

993
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:41,020
to you want to say you need to save you

994
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:43,340
to keep your plutonium 239 differently

995
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:47,440
yeah I think we mr. Benton had quite a

996
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:51,550
bit yeah you did just a quick feedback

997
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:55,000
there's like very vivid and constructive

998
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:58,400
discussion on the Internet

999
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:02,650
yeah and one question stick like how

1000
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:06,020
many percent from such a missile is

1001
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:09,560
staying in the Castro as atomic waste is

1002
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:11,380
it different from it atomic you knew you

1003
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:15,490
a.m.

1004
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:18,020
yeah well it's like apples and pears

1005
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:19,368
it's different from the from the stuff

1006
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:27,440
that that okay a power plant someone

1007
00:56:19,369 --> 00:56:29,390
have any more so so where are the went

1008
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,540
on people about the cosmos stuff I I

1009
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:35,029
don't really know a lot about castles

1010
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:37,130
these are just just just I only know

1011
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:39,619
that these are containers which are used

1012
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:40,880
to safely move nuclear fuel around a

1013
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:41,560
nuclear waste around I don't know about

1014
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,000
you but ER

1015
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,230
so technically I don't really know much

1016
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,480
more about this so I can't really answer

1017
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:54,619
this so the question was is there more

1018
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:59,320
atomic waste if we make weapon atomic in

1019
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:59,320
a way Neum yeah Mountain danger

1020
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:10,700
define danger it's really a quite a

1021
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:12,859
quite a fishy fishy thing I it's usually

1022
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,390
it's then it's more dangerous or always

1023
00:57:12,859 --> 00:57:16,970
in the in the form of which is this in

1024
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:19,180
the weapon but because you can actually

1025
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:21,410
make damage with it and you can you know

1026
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:22,790
damage towards people but I don't that's

1027
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:24,920
probably my answer I can't be saying

1028
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:28,220
yeah I think there's one last question

1029
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:32,770
microphone number two please yeah it's

1030
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:35,450
like about my understanding I'm not sure

1031
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:37,700
what it's against those trivial

1032
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:39,290
solutions to mix like highly enriched

1033
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:41,980
uranium with flour in which to rhenium

1034
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:46,340
so we get like neutral anyone and we

1035
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:50,119
don't need to destroy it and we are like

1036
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:54,650
skipping all this waste problematics so

1037
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:55,849
problem is this is only a theoretical so

1038
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:58,400
it's only a theoretically thing because

1039
00:57:55,849 --> 00:57:59,960
the others you also need to get rid of

1040
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,590
the highly enriched uranium we also need

1041
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:06,560
to get rid of the weapons but problem is

1042
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:08,300
theoretically you can do it but practice

1043
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,830
you are missing the highly enriched

1044
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:12,020
uranium you're missing the high because

1045
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:19,220
yeah it's just not around so you can't

1046
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:20,810
redo it yeah anyways yes yeah but this

1047
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:23,750
in its into the people which have the

1048
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:25,520
weapon silos they they have a bullet so

1049
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:27,740
the points that you could make atomic

1050
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:30,650
energy from it or I don't know why it

1051
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:35,419
should do this pulley tick is the answer

1052
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:39,920
here really I think yeah I think we need

1053
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:44,180
to stop or talk here yeah but there's a

1054
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:46,210
good message here we stay here and we

1055
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:50,509
can ask a question afterwards I think

1056
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:53,270
there's opinion of the c3 species so you

1057
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:55,730
can spend for a be there thanks also

1058
00:58:53,270 --> 00:59:00,009
from the conflation boom listening this

1059
00:58:55,730 --> 00:59:05,260
was the translation of the talk by Luca

1060
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:05,260
MFR and Oscar

1061
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:09,970
tonight

1062
