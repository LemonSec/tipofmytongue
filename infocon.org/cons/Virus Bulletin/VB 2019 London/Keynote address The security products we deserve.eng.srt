okay okay welcome to the very end of VB

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,039
2019 welcome to the very end of the

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,179

then we'll announce the location for VB

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,199
2020 but before that you have what I

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,640
hope to be one of the highlights of the

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,920
conference it's the closing keynote I

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,099
first saw a room give a keynote at a

11
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:27,869
conference in Germany four and a half

12
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,880
years ago which is one of these

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,460
legendary talks you see the few people

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,770
that that I sort of see that were there

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,559
we still talk about it is China it's an

16
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,710
in-joke and Adrian gave a talk at Phebe

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,430
2016 in Denver and one of these rare

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,530
occasions where we say okay we're not

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,789
gonna be very strict with time I will

20
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,410
let him run a bit longer because it's

21
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,789
such an interesting discussion going on

22
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,420
so I'm very pleased to have her une mère

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,449

I'm Adrian as as he said and that's her

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,420
room beard one beard too much beard egde

32
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,420
we both came from about a jillion miles

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,619
away from different locations I'm

34
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,329
actually the one employee and thinks

35
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,100
that lives in the u.s. everyone else is

36
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,630
in South Africa and between the two of

37
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,000
us we've seen the industry from a lot of

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,409
different perspectives over the years

39
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,890
over a lot of years a couple decades I

40
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,170
think four decades between the two of us

41
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,310
maybe as a sysadmin developer Blue Team

42
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,920
Red Team I was an industry analyst for a

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,420
while so I wrote about the industry I

44
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,869
talked to investors

45
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:59,729
Haroon has also you know starting a

46
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,380
company owning a company talking to

47
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,090
investors and we're now both it think'st

48
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:10,050
so state of play in the industry by the

49
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,599
numbers a lot of things are getting

50
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,740
crazy one of them is

51
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,720
and this is a pretty ubiquitous slide

52
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,700
you know I think a lot of decks we see

53
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,710
these this slide I think it's great that

54
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,550
someone at momentum partners sits around

55
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,950
and copies and pastes logos into this

56
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,480
all day it must be a full-time job

57
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,710
keeping this up I mean just imagine I

58
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,390
don't know what they build that in but

59
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,980
you know that that's got to be a

60
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,670
gigabyte PDF or whatever they're they're

61
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:47,730
creating that in so so many vendors in

62
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,320
the industry you know you could easily

63
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,210
you know this is just what RSA looks

64
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,130
like this is the floor plan if you're

65
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,340
getting a booth there but there's enough

66
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,100
vendors in the industry that you could

67
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,230
fill easily three RSA's including all

68
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,900
the little startup vendor areas we have

69
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,080
now RSA is so big that it's extended out

70
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,710
to the Marriott you know it's it there's

71
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,510
vendors all over the place they'll have

72
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,250
vendors in coffee shops and restaurants

73
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,900
a couple years out

74
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,890
another thing that's grown huge by the

75
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,930
numbers security conferences 111 this

76
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,150
year 585 worldwide in 173 cities and 52

77
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,600
countries but I'm joking here because

78
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,670
that's just besides that's just the

79
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:44,130
besides franchise so actually there's

80
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,960
two thousand eighty three conferences

81
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,850
this year if you pull out all the stuff

82
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,040
that you'd argue with me is not really a

83
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,200
conference like training stuff job fairs

84
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,250
stuff like that so a lot of conferences

85
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,700
full 10-fold from what we saw less than

86
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,620
ten years ago so less than ten years ago

87
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,270
we used to say wow there's almost a

88
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,710
security conference for every day of the

89
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,710
year now we'll leave one security

90
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,150
conference to go check out another

91
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,010
security conference and then maybe go to

92
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,320
a third all in the same day you know for

93
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,358
you attend blackhat at all you know what

94
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,660
I mean you might run over to b-sides Las

95
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,390
Vegas and then you know other ones have

96
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,820
popped up around the same time Def Con

97
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,419
itself

98
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,960
is a series of conferences in one each

99
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,909
village is its own conference with its

100
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:35,789
own budget with its own CFP so it's

101
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:40,259
crazy so this made me wonder with this

102
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,090
many conferences how bad does overlap

103
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,319
get and on June 4th 2019 we had 19

104
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,169
security conferences in one day or at

105
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,270
least starting on one day yeah I'm sure

106
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,779
they all ran different lengths and so

107
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:56,669
many that that wasn't even 19 there was

108
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:58,080
another four that I hadn't shown you

109
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,289
that's how that's how many 19 in one day

110
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:02,969
looks like and that's all over the world

111
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,860
that's Australia that's North America

112
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,650
that's the UK of course the dirty secret

113
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,710
that people who are in offense people

114
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,509
are pen testing or people doing incident

115
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:17,639
response now is that for all the

116
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,650
products that we have and all the

117
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,750
conference's that are going on it's not

118
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,819
significantly harder to break into

119
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:24,569
places

120
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:27,509
okay so pen testers leave them alone for

121
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:29,370
a short while on an internal network

122
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,449
it's still clubbing baby seals the the

123
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:37,500
stats back in the 2012 or 2012 Verizon

124
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,669
dbi are said that 92 percent of hogs had

125
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:43,680
to be told by a third party when they

126
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,689
were compromised

127
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:47,330
adrián points out that in retail

128
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,879
currently a hundred percent need to be

129
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,300
informed by a third party mandiant in

130
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,500
2015

131
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,509
said that the median time before someone

132
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:58,979
discovered they were being attacked was

133
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,580
205 days IBM pony mom just put up a

134
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,969
study this year to say it's 206 days and

135
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:10,289
so for the most part what we're saying

136
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:12,149
is there's a zillion products there's a

137
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:13,949
zillion conferences there's a lot of

138
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:16,349
money being thrown into it and for the

139
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:16,979
most part

140
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,680
none of it materially impacts attackers

141
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,509
and so the question for us is why and

142
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,889
for the most part that's what we're

143
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:28,139
trying to look at today because we've

144
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,599
got some hypotheses and at the end

145
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,039
you'll get a chance to tell us why we

146
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:36,180
idiot like most things um it's a

147
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,849
combination we feel of nature nurture

148
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:40,860
and incentives

149
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,010
and we boil it down largely to these

150
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,400
three things when we building security

151
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,700
companies we raise money badly we build

152
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,900
products badly and we do sales badly so

153
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,450
we'll start with raising money badly and

154
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,450
we'll start with something non a

155
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,460
non-confrontational for InfoSec

156
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,500
companies the VC model is broken okay

157
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,720
and it's really easy to pick on VC's

158
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,930
because they push for growth and they

159
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,490
invest in exits they don't invest in

160
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,860
companies but I'm not even talking about

161
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,930
that because fairly recently a smart

162
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,760
investor told me hey that's the game

163
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,950
like that's what we do we investing

164
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,320
money we hoping for good exit you our

165
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,510
founder you run your company the way you

166
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,490
run your company and we'll both work so

167
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,010
so I'm not even talking about those the

168
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,540
two things that I do want to talk about

169
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,000
though the two things that I think make

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,140
the security ecosystem poorer is the

171
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,210
fact that they introduce complexity and

172
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,490
and something that we calling proxy

173
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,990
boost um complexity is fairly simple if

174
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:54,000
if you are pitching a VC typically what

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,730
you want to go to them with this year is

176
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,010
something like this so so you have a

177
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,320
good Ivy League education and you say we

178
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,570
crawling the dark web at scale we're

179
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,730
adding some machine learning and we

180
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:09,720
doing something with apt and this would

181
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,660
hold up really well against an excess

182
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,210
admin who says we're gonna solve the

183
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,180
local admin password problem on machines

184
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,970
but actually if someone built a proper a

185
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,100
product that solved the local admin

186
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,690
password problem on machines

187
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,840
they'd impact millions of customers much

188
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,140
more than any machine learning dark web

189
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,570
IOC is are going to and and part of this

190
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,990
is why you end up seeing every years RSA

191
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,690
have a theme right because there's been

192
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,669
a swath of companies that's now been

193
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,250
invested in that's now pushing out the

194
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,770
latest hotness okay and it doesn't

195
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,540
matter that we haven't solved problems

196
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,720
since the late 80s or 90s

197
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,670
it's the new hotness that gets new

198
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,300
investment

199
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,089
and that's where people go um the second

200
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:59,339
one is a little more vague mainly

201
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,070
because we made up this term and and

202
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,410
that's the fact that VC is kind of boost

203
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,019
proxies and and what I'm talking about

204
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,320
here goes a little further back and and

205
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,899
the problem is in the InfoSec industry

206
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:16,410
most customers can't tell if products

207
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,339
are good or bad and in the absence of

208
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,050
being able to tell whether our product

209
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,690
is good or bad they use other proxies

210
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,170
and unfortunately most of these proxies

211
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,230
are pretty flawed so so for example if

212
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,149
if your company looks big and you've got

213
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:34,890
lots of good salespeople or if you've

214
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,320
got a massive boot at blackhat or

215
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,690
massive boot that are they say you

216
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,850
imbued with the type of credibility that

217
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,190
has nothing to do with whether you have

218
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,990
a product or not or whether your product

219
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,420
actually works or not and and this

220
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,000
causes a specific problem um that makes

221
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,120
VC investment dangerous so typically

222
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,850
when when VCS work with consumer

223
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,250
software there'll be a founder who'll

224
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,089
come along either has a POC or solves a

225
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:03,510
problem

226
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,480
and VCS will come in and give him money

227
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,829
for his first round and with this bunch

228
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:14,250
of founders who try some of them will

229
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,490
get some users and those who do will get

230
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,000
another bunch of money and at some point

231
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,240
one person wins all of the users and

232
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,490
they and their VC get together and

233
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,850
celebrate an IPO okay it's a it's a

234
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,860
little bit Darwinian but it kind of

235
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,230
works you you end up with something

236
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,930
that's reasonable the problem that we

237
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,170
have is because of this bad information

238
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,570
the bad information asymmetry that

239
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,240
customers have in InfoSec you end up

240
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,339
with something like this with security

241
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,430
sales so you have a founder VC's give

242
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,920
them money but what that money allows

243
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,620
them to do is buy those proxies that

244
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,320
make their products look reasonable or

245
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,310
legitimate so once the once the VCS have

246
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,610
injected money into the business you get

247
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:05,970
the

248
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,209
first class of sales that make VCS go

249
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:12,089
well you've got customers it's time for

250
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,550
your second round of funding okay and

251
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,740
they're currently so many customers who

252
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,879
try anything once because why not that

253
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,009
this process ends up running a lot

254
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:25,769
longer than it should so bad products

255
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,959
lasts a lot longer in the marketplace

256
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,420
it's why you see so much hatred for

257
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,879
InfoSec products because people know

258
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,500
they spend money on them they know they

259
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,870
buy them and they making no material

260
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,110
difference to anyone and this isn't

261
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,970
something that the VCS want either

262
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,620
because they're investing in these

263
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,319
companies and actually fundamentally the

264
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:49,589
products for the most part suck and and

265
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:51,029
what you're seeing here is that the

266
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:54,420
money ends up muddying the water when

267
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,920
actually what they're looking for is

268
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,629
clarity so we're gonna move on to

269
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:01,980
building products badly and

270
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,199
interestingly the first thing that comes

271
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:06,949
up again is a question of complexity

272
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:11,459
okay and we've known forever

273
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,980
that complexity was the opposite of

274
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,339
security Shania wrote an article a while

275
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:20,370
back saying complexity is the worst

276
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,800
enemy you could have he was pretty

277
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,170
appreciate um he goes on to say listen

278
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,779
normal products can have flaws and

279
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,180
you'll discover them in beta testing but

280
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,850
you won't discover security flaws with

281
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,519
beta testing and he ends the article by

282
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,709
saying listen the way this stuff is

283
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:39,959
going considering we don't know how to

284
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,019
handle complexity we've got two options

285
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:44,910
either we agree that our future is gonna

286
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,689
be insecure or we hold back and we start

287
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:51,089
doing stuff simpler and of course what's

288
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:53,370
interesting about that is that that was

289
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,819
the Schneier article from 99 ok since

290
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:59,759
then things have just gone at a more

291
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,759
ridiculous pace probably the most

292
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:05,009
egregious example that everyone likes to

293
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:09,300
beat up on is GPG Moxie Marlinspike from

294
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,629
signal pointed out at some point that if

295
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:16,230
you actually take a look at the GP g-man

296
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,000
page

297
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,060
it goes on for pages and pages and pages

298
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,080
and in fact Moxie did a check and

299
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,330
figures that it's actually longer than

300
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:32,300
Fahrenheit four five one um and what's

301
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,880
interesting about that will probably not

302
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,160
reach the bottom of this what's most

303
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,720
interesting about that is it's probably

304
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,870
why if you ever introduce someone to GPG

305
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,400
one of the first things they do is

306
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,330
accidentally mail you their private key

307
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,090
and again you have to ask yourself and

308
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,760
GPG is easy to pick on but if you

309
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,190
install any enterprise security software

310
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,190
you almost certainly find that you need

311
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,560
to send your staff on training to run

312
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,350
that enterprise software ok and and

313
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,780
Facebook manages to win because my

314
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,850
granny was able to figure out how to run

315
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,780
it and so if we question why we doing

316
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,930
software like this you bump into three

317
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,330
big reasons the one we already spoke

318
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,150
about was investors like complexity

319
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,910
whether they admit it or not they want

320
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,740
to be on the cutting edge of science and

321
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,050
technology not on solving the local

322
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,860
admin problem the second one is part of

323
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,800
where InfoSec came from was from our old

324
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,820
b o fh roots okay so so anyone who has a

325
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,370
sysadmin or insecurity in the late 90s

326
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,980
you'd read bureau fetch articles where

327
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,590
somebody goes along deletes his users

328
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,200
mail stupid user didn't run a backup and

329
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,510
we've kind of pulled that stuff with us

330
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,360
so we make products that are angry all

331
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,340
the time like well he should know he

332
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,320
should run backups idiot that's why he

333
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,430
got ransomware

334
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,580
he should know how to exchange go to a

335
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,900
GPG key party to exchange keys and and

336
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,180
we take the stuff with us and for the

337
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,460
most part it's why users don't like our

338
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,830
products and and with that there's a

339
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,380
whole bunch of old tropes that just

340
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,260
won't die things like security and

341
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,080
usability are always opposite like they

342
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,300
not and they don't have to be but we

343
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,430
keep saying that and so it excuses us

344
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,290
from building poor interfaces or

345
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,960
building products that actually suck

346
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,270
um and and this stuff leads to insecure

347
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:39,590
products that you yeah yeah and so

348
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,980
product insecurity yeah this is kind of

349
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,900
a if this is a special topic because

350
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,970
it's generally not how we think of our

351
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,540
products but again this goes back to the

352
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,250
money you know where the money comes

353
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,830
from instills this need to grow to move

354
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,740
very fast and you know that gives time

355
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,610
to build MVPs and and functional

356
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,560
products but maybe not secure products

357
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,930
and you know we've seen this over and

358
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,400
over and over again you know many people

359
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,510
pointed it out Dino does over here you

360
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,820
know I'm sure everyone here is familiar

361
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:21,770
with this painful part of our history

362
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:26,720
here but really you know this isn't the

363
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,160
stuff that we're looking at for security

364
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,140
flaws because we're buying it to address

365
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,750
security flaws to fill these gaps that

366
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,920
we have and over and over and over we

367
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,390
see this in fact the US government put

368
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,040
together all their vulnerabilities all

369
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,980
their security issues and found that and

370
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,900
this is a little bit older this is six

371
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,520
years old here but you know they found

372
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,350
it's it's still about the same today

373
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,000
about thirty percent of all their

374
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,770
security issues come from security

375
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,760
products across the entire US government

376
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,880
and famously very code a couple years

377
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,430
back took a look at software from

378
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,990
different industries and found security

379
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,949
second to last in terms of of product

380
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:13,209
quality with regards to security flaws

381
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:16,670
so we see it as vendors all the time so

382
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,500
we build a product that that lives on

383
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,780
customer networks and frequently people

384
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,119
would ask us well why don't why doesn't

385
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,699
your product spend multiple VLANs and

386
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:27,949
and one of the things it's one of the

387
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:29,480
times we go back to them and say we

388
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,870
never going to do that um and in our

389
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,750
tiny niche we're the only company I know

390
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,480
that doesn't everyone else happily

391
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,090
spends VLANs for their customers and

392
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,310
what it means is at some point when they

393
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:43,920
are big enough

394
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,900
target they're going to be responsible

395
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,330
for actually allowing attackers to hop

396
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,510
across customer customer segments and

397
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,880
for the most part customers don't seem

398
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,340
to know and the vendors don't seem to

399
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,700
care something a similar that happened

400
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,580
when we built version like one of our

401
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,830
product we went and found the best code

402
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,600
auditors we could find and we paid them

403
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,580
a whole bunch of money and they spent

404
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,770
months taking the product apart and gave

405
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,290
us a nice report on it um and it turns

406
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,630
out that that is really really uncommon

407
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,300
so it turns out that most security

408
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,300
products just aren't undergoing any sort

409
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,090
of security review so so you take the

410
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,070
software that's now running at critical

411
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,320
parts of your network normally running

412
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,820
with higher privilege levels and

413
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,490
actually nobody is bothered to audit it

414
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,490
for security and and again what's

415
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,200
interesting is it's not like these

416
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,540
companies are not spending money they

417
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,430
spending lots of money on other things

418
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,710
they just not spending it on making

419
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,140
their software more secure and the

420
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,470
question of why this is happening again

421
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,780
it's because there's no pushback from

422
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,050
customers so you hear that a major

423
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,150
firewall appliance actually has a

424
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,190
hard-coded username and password

425
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,310
allowing everyone to log into it you

426
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,610
patch it and move on and fundamentally

427
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,560
it's such a breakdown of trust that

428
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,930
someone should be going how can we trust

429
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,540
this to be our gatekeeper when for the

430
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,400
last four years it's had a hard-coded

431
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,530
username and password for some reason

432
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,320
and and so at this point it's hard to

433
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,080
tell if it's an inability to tell the

434
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,200
difference or if it's just indifference

435
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,960
but for the most part it sucks so the

436
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,420
last one we're going to touch on is us

437
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,390
doing sales terribly and and I think

438
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,120
this one is more complex because it

439
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,780
touches on more things so the the really

440
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,120
old thing used to be if you if a man

441
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,250
builds a bit of mousetrap the world will

442
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,100
beat a path to his door okay and of

443
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,770
course because nobody likes dreamers

444
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,930
people quickly pointed out that that's

445
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,480
not true if you build a better mousetrap

446
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,250
mostly the world doesn't care

447
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,080
actually you've got to market it and

448
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,810
you've got to do sales and all of that

449
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,760
but it's our contention that that has

450
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,670
gone too far especially with the current

451
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,520
model of building software um it seems

452
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,010
like we've overcorrected a little too

453
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,740
much so these days you tell people it

454
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,380
doesn't matter what tech you have what

455
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,720
matters more is your go to market

456
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,230
strategy you could have inferior tech as

457
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,780
long as you find the right way to get it

458
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,290
out to the market and so typically if if

459
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,180
you start to become a big boy company

460
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,460
you get VC investment they'll give you

461
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,580
this plan for high functioning sales and

462
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,950
marketing team and they'll show you how

463
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,470
you need to do email blasts and phone

464
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,980
calls and get vendor awards and go to

465
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,020
conferences and get ads at airports and

466
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,780
and we're gonna talk about almost all of

467
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,710
this so the first one is really easy to

468
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,220
kill right getting spam emails or spam

469
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,630
calls is a ridiculous problem to have

470
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:04,540
recently like in the last week on the

471
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,800
seaso relationship podcast they asked

472
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,770
Cemile you who's from Bank of America

473
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,360
that if he had to choose the single

474
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,370
biggest security challenge he had to

475
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,350
deal with when working at Bank of

476
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,780
America what would it be and so he

477
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,280
thought a little bit and he said if I

478
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,820
had to pick just one it would be the

479
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,740
bazillion vendors that came knocking on

480
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,690
my door trying to get a piece of my

481
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,260
budget that whole podcast is essentially

482
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,630
on how to deal with vendors because they

483
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,880
such a nightmare and it's kind of a

484
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,560
strange thing that that you'd ask

485
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,810
someone in security what their biggest

486
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,760
challenges and their challenge is

487
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,580
vendors because you'd think that we were

488
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,830
there to to solve the problem not create

489
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,940
more of them um and then I'll kill

490
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,210
advertising really quickly because

491
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,100
advertising has a whole other

492
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,290
complication like if you've been to an

493
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,030
airport in the US you would have seen an

494
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,310
ad like this and and for the most part I

495
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,570
just think it's confusing

496
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,670
like like we studied it for a little bit

497
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,890
and and I'm not sure is the snake the

498
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,279
good guy

499
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:13,999
is the big kept a good guy like how does

500
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,909
it apply like are they using machine

501
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:21,979
learning of like like I think many good

502
00:22:21,979 --> 00:22:24,320
hours are wasted I'm trying to figure

503
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,429
this stuff out

504
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:28,279
um to get a bad rap yes snakes get a bad

505
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:31,700
rap so so we'll ignore that when it

506
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,190
comes to conferences we've written a

507
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,929
whole long blog post on how how these

508
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:41,269
work for us and one of the things we

509
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:43,009
were surprised that so the first time we

510
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:45,529
did in RSA booth is that it's really

511
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:48,889
good like as a young vendor RSA is

512
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:51,409
really worked out for us we met lots of

513
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:53,330
customers we sold lots of Canaries and

514
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,719
we were surprised by it um but so so if

515
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:57,710
you're bored you should go read that

516
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,320
blog post but two things are interesting

517
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,690
for me um when you start looking at

518
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,059
booths and that's if you go to the booth

519
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:07,639
you'll find lots of this stuff right the

520
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:09,469
the first is some guy showing everyone

521
00:23:09,469 --> 00:23:12,799
how to solve a Rubik's Cube and again

522
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,389
I'm not sure what that has to do with

523
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:17,210
whatever product they were selling but

524
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,359
but the people seem entertained and the

525
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,489
other one is you can stop by this booth

526
00:23:22,489 --> 00:23:26,330
and play in their ball pit okay and and

527
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,429
you see that stuff happening a lot at

528
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:33,649
RSA like people take $250,000 worth of

529
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:36,229
floor space and they put up a maze of

530
00:23:36,229 --> 00:23:39,769
mirrors for you to play in and for the

531
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:41,539
most part I think they might as well

532
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:44,779
just take the VCS money and set it on

533
00:23:44,779 --> 00:23:46,549
fire they'll probably get better

534
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:50,089
headlines for it but but I think for us

535
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:54,019
as customers it it gives you this allow

536
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:57,289
myself to quote myself that if you go to

537
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:00,229
a company on the floor and if they

538
00:24:00,229 --> 00:24:02,389
spending 90 percent of their time on

539
00:24:02,389 --> 00:24:04,249
their gimmick instead of actually

540
00:24:04,249 --> 00:24:06,169
showing you their product then those

541
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:07,940
guys are probably trying to win you over

542
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,580
with their marketing dollars not with

543
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,609
the actual product dollars and again

544
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:17,229
it's something that we should change and

545
00:24:17,229 --> 00:24:20,059
so at this point Oh we'll start talking

546
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:26,659
about awards had a fancy background I

547
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:29,720
didn't know if you're gonna toss it yes

548
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,259
so awards are pretty common to see you

549
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:35,749
know this is just my flight to Vegas on

550
00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:37,909
a single flight you know I'm seeing

551
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,889
awards from the airline awards from the

552
00:24:39,889 --> 00:24:43,549
airport Awards from somebody pushing rum

553
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:48,470
in the airport that was in Atlanta and

554
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,749
yeah it's it's fairly normal it's it's

555
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:52,759
normal to see awards and industries as a

556
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:55,549
way to drum up interest to show

557
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:58,039
credibility to show that you know hey

558
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,599
not only do we have a product other

559
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,639
people have looked at it they say it's

560
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:04,460
okay you know so from that standpoint it

561
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,489
seems fairly reasonable but it can go

562
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:10,220
overboard so we're going to just take a

563
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,009
look at just like a little case study

564
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:16,429
here basically and this is Paul and Paul

565
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:18,049
is the chief marketing officer for a

566
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,599
company called occipital Mon and

567
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,489
occipital Mon has been winning awards

568
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:25,849
you know the CMO and this is pretty

569
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:27,889
normal a chief marketing officer VP

570
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:30,109
director marketing is going to sign up

571
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:32,359
for these awards and they're gonna put

572
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,649
in all this information about the

573
00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:36,589
company there's some judges they're

574
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:39,499
gonna take a look at the awards and you

575
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:41,029
know Paul's doing pretty good here he's

576
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:42,169
got it you know we can give him some

577
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:44,659
applause you see he's he's done some

578
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:47,960
good work he's got three awards and and

579
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,460
this is in two months no less he's

580
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,869
already gotten three awards for his

581
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:54,649
company and but the thing is Paul's fake

582
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:58,369
I created Paul and I created occipital

583
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:02,329
Mon and I actually I got these awards

584
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:04,969
which are real awards and and I paid

585
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:09,559
real money for them and you know so I

586
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:11,179
didn't make these up you know these are

587
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:13,759
you know I took that I filled out the

588
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:15,589
forms I put in my credit card details

589
00:26:15,589 --> 00:26:18,379
and I won a bunch of awards in two

590
00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:20,570
months with a fictitious person in a

591
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,019
fictitious company and to my

592
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:25,269
consternation

593
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:27,889
Paul has been on LinkedIn for two months

594
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:29,829
now and he's gotten three c-suite level

595
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:34,960
executive level job offers so

596
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:41,750
screw you Paul

597
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,700
so who judges these awards you know so I

598
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,190
mentioned there's judging going on you

599
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,679
know and you know I've got to be careful

600
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,120
to say there are some good awards out

601
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,190
there there are some organizations out

602
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,659
there that put a lot of effort in to

603
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:59,610
make it independent to make it worthy of

604
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,710
spending time on you know where it's not

605
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,570
just here's a forum put in a credit card

606
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:07,890
number and and we'll scribe something on

607
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,460
a on a trophy or an object for you but

608
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,140
in this case this is actually one of the

609
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,820
bigger words out there you know I found

610
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,740
that this was one of the one of the

611
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,740
judges and he's he's a radio DJ in New

612
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,559
York City and what was his name

613
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,640
brimstone this is brimstone so I you

614
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,770
know I mean hard to question that

615
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,010
brimstone is is checking out your anti

616
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,070
apt gear see if it's worthy of an award

617
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,049
and of course everybody gets an award

618
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:39,630
and they put on galas so you can get

619
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,520
dressed up you can go you can get your

620
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,590
award they make it look like that you

621
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,360
came up on stage to receive the award

622
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,899
and and I assume these are models you

623
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:50,190
know these have nothing to do with the

624
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,750
company most of these award companies

625
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,899
where you can just buy the awards are

626
00:27:54,899 --> 00:27:56,730
one or two people just operating it out

627
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:59,429
of their house you know there's hardly

628
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:02,429
anything there so yeah yeah it looks

629
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:03,750
good with the with the models and

630
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,919
everything here but when you actually

631
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,169
pick up your award every single that

632
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:09,600
person is there because they're going to

633
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,240
get an award nobody loses everyone picks

634
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,760
up an award and it's just like a

635
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,620
coat-check like you walk up with your

636
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,970
ticket you hand them your ticket and

637
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,370
they hand you your five awards seven

638
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,649
awards ten awards however many awards

639
00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:25,380
that you buy and you go home with it I

640
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,520
don't know if they give you a bag for

641
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,350
these these are pretty heavy obelisks

642
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,480
and then you look at the websites and

643
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,370
you find you know lack of a lot of them

644
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,899
are cookie cutter what they've done is

645
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:38,520
they've taken this idea of awards and

646
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,559
it's so successful they're like well

647
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,179
let's do this industry let's do this

648
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,100
industry what about these people they

649
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,200
need awards too you know so they start

650
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,850
popping up they all look the same

651
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,560
you know so we did a little OSINT here

652
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,350
took the Google Analytics number and

653
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:54,360
yeah you know this one company which

654
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,400
again is one or two people just cloning

655
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,650
a website and setting it up for other

656
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,110
other awards they're just cloning these

657
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,940
sites you know there's there's a

658
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,620
bajillion of them you know that will

659
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,720
sell you whatever you want with whatever

660
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,940
written on there in fact some of them

661
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,550
say we won't even have categories for

662
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,230
the awards until everyone enters because

663
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:16,560
we don't want to leave anyone out so you

664
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,240
can get an award for a triple factor

665
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,370
quadruple factor authentication you know

666
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:24,240
whatever you want and some of these you

667
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,100
know I said one or two person shops all

668
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,200
of a sudden that linked to an award on

669
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,660
your website you know it's part you know

670
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,110
at the domain hoster and you know this

671
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,040
is what it looks like when your

672
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,770
customers click on it because they don't

673
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,510
need the extra money anymore you know

674
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,130
maybe they got a job doing something

675
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,660
else and they're not doing the awards

676
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,630
thing anymore so they didn't pay the

677
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:49,830
registration fee all these came from one

678
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,930
vendor and the problem that this creates

679
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,540
I mentioned before there are some good

680
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,500
awards out there there are some good

681
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,480
programs out there but how can you tell

682
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,700
this is a single vendor and this is a

683
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,400
tiny fraction of what this vendor has on

684
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,960
their site on the awards part of their

685
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,920
site how can you tell if this is a good

686
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,990
vendor you can't tell anything about the

687
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,890
product from this

688
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,200
I mean maybe one or two of these will

689
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,820
link to something that actually tells

690
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,800
you something about the product from a

691
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,630
third party who's independent from the

692
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,750
vendor but I think in these cases not a

693
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,330
single one of these does that you know

694
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,550
it's simply it's it might go to a park

695
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:30,180
domain and so you know I did a bit of a

696
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,580
survey and found that most people don't

697
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,470
even care about them anyway you know

698
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,720
most people are aware that some of these

699
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,760
awards are fake and therefore because

700
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,860
some percentage are fake they discount

701
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,050
all of them they ignore all of them so

702
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,790
it's not even worth doing anyway and in

703
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,700
fact it's even worse than worthless it

704
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,890
could prevent you from getting customers

705
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,370
some 38% of people if they see a bunch

706
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,230
of awards like that it's going to give

707
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,460
them a red flag and they're gonna go

708
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,760
elsewhere

709
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:05,890
like that it's more sucky than it looks

710
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:09,880
like like I think it's insane that we

711
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,880
accept that somebody flat-out lies to us

712
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,490
and then buy their stuff because in the

713
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,140
example that you were looking at like

714
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,940
literally someone at the company said

715
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,670
okay I'm gonna take my credit card pay

716
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,340
for this fake award so that I can put it

717
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,270
on my site and buy credibility and like

718
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,130
I was inked alien-like like if if my

719
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,650
doctor I had one fake certificate on his

720
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,130
wall

721
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,860
he wouldn't be my doctor anymore but but

722
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,600
we totally fine with it

723
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,940
when vendors do it and everyone kind of

724
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,560
shrugs and so while we talking about

725
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,480
unacceptable um we're gonna go on to the

726
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,560
next one which is analysts and and this

727
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,090
one is a bit of a sore topic because

728
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,920
like we've got analysts were friends

729
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,670
Adrian was an analyst and they're people

730
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,440
who are undoubtably smart and

731
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,650
undoubtably nice but this model that

732
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,990
currently exists with analysts in the

733
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,620
industry is broken okay so so how it

734
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,360
typically works when someone wants to

735
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,130
prove to you that there's nothing wrong

736
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,410
with the way this works is they'll tell

737
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,060
you that it's absolutely not

738
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:22,630
pay-for-play what happens is anyone can

739
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,850
share your time to brief an analyst and

740
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,880
then all you have to do is keep in that

741
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,190
analysts ear and keep him appraised of

742
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,740
how your company is doing and then he'll

743
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,870
write good stuff about you if you don't

744
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,180
suck and of course the inquiring mind

745
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,710
has to ask how do you keep in their ear

746
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,500
and keep them updated and the answer

747
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:49,240
does anyone know anyone exactly so

748
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,640
typically you pay sixty thousand dollars

749
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,100
for this entry-level thing and it allows

750
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,260
you a minimum number of a minimum amount

751
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,090
of time that you can spend with this

752
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,310
analyst but it's totally not

753
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:04,420
pay-for-play like anyone can do it but

754
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,100
if you pay this amount of money you're

755
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,800
gonna get that amount of time and in

756
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,460
part it's insane because every time this

757
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,960
has ever come up with me

758
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,509
like I genuinely feel slightly rayji

759
00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:18,879
about it um and and then you'll see that

760
00:33:18,879 --> 00:33:21,789
analysts are in this position end up

761
00:33:21,789 --> 00:33:24,070
playing this crazy type of double game

762
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,889
right where they say no no you're not

763
00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:30,220
paying us for where we are right about

764
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,950
you you paying us because we talk to so

765
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,499
many customers we know what's good for

766
00:33:35,499 --> 00:33:38,470
you so when you pay us we talk to all

767
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,179
these customers and we tell you how you

768
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:44,230
should build your product and our other

769
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,450
mutual arm is the one that actually

770
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,710
writes stuff about you and and if

771
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,090
someone wants to make this statement

772
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:55,149
then I think what they need to do is try

773
00:33:55,149 --> 00:33:58,600
to sell one as a service without being

774
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,360
able to do - let's see how many people

775
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,789
pay them for their advice on the product

776
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:07,149
when they not also writing up a advice

777
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:11,379
on what to buy a few years back Richard

778
00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:14,109
Steele in who was a consultant was an

779
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:16,270
analyst at Gartner put out this book on

780
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:20,260
how to influence analysts and one of the

781
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,760
things you notice the thing that that

782
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,329
genuinely

783
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:25,379
I think gets in my craw the most if

784
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:28,239
everyone's aware that analysts have a

785
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,179
great amount of power and and what you

786
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:33,579
see from the book is how easy it is for

787
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:37,510
power to corrupt and so what you'll see

788
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,239
is Richard has a section that says what

789
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,909
you should consider doing is you know

790
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,739
the airport that your analyst is gonna

791
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:49,149
go into so by adds in that analysts

792
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:51,668
Airport in fact wouldn't it be cool if

793
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:54,099
you actually quoted him in the ad

794
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:57,400
because clearly that's that's the right

795
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,980
way to go and and you see that going in

796
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,109
grades right because when they come over

797
00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:05,890
for the $60,000 analyst briefing make

798
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,720
sure you give them the best boardroom

799
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,819
and make sure you give them nice food

800
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:12,400
and I'm pretty sure you know what their

801
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,619
favorite drink is right because that's

802
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:18,160
what you should be doing um and actually

803
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,160
if you really want to impress them go to

804
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,290
their conferences and crap for their

805
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:27,220
talks and try to get them promoted and

806
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,190
tell your CIO friends and seesaw friends

807
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,560
to make them more popular at their

808
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,660
company because that's gonna be good for

809
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:39,040
you um and of course all of this just

810
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,280
makes me rage insanely because what

811
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,570
you'll notice is what you going from is

812
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:49,119
let's invest the time and make a product

813
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,900
that people want or people need to let's

814
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,690
make a product that analysts think

815
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,980
people want okay and for the most part

816
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,480
analysts nobody's rushing out to buy

817
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,700
hardware that was designed by Gartner

818
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,150
okay designed by Apple is is a thing for

819
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:11,560
a reason now for us to speak about this

820
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,440
is a little bit awkward because you end

821
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,990
up kind of tilting at windmills right

822
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,330
even friends I know in really good

823
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:22,090
really popular companies will say listen

824
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:24,970
don't fight this like get someone on

825
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,500
your team who knows how to brief

826
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,119
analysts pay the 60 K it's a analysts X

827
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,609
and you'll be fine I don't want to for

828
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:39,880
for multiple reasons but but probably

829
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,580
the biggest reason I don't want to is

830
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,800
because I think it's wasted effort I

831
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,050
think that the time that people are

832
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,599
spending making sure that analysts are

833
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,030
happy they should be spending making

834
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,400
sure customers are happy and I think

835
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,589
that's why we end up with software that

836
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,890
VCS would choose or analysts would run

837
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:04,540
but that don't fundamentally help us so

838
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,390
we end up in this crazy place where we

839
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,190
buying stupid ads that don't make sense

840
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,920
we alienate our customers we burn our

841
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,460
money in booths and we build products

842
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,490
that Gartner tells us to build and the

843
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:23,380
question is why and in part it's because

844
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,040
that's kind of worked till now like

845
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,820
that's kind of what we've been doing

846
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,460
except not really right like if you

847
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,410
consider that we've got all these

848
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:38,440
products and nobody takes a call from a

849
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,450
security vendor or we've got all these

850
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,150
products

851
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,549
and any pentester says it's not even a

852
00:37:43,549 --> 00:37:46,519
speed bump that's pretty much the

853
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:49,130
definition of market failure we've got

854
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,749
all these products but they don't do

855
00:37:50,749 --> 00:37:54,740
anything and again the thing that keeps

856
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,259
coming back is that there's no pushback

857
00:37:57,259 --> 00:38:00,200
against vendors for this we see vendors

858
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,029
saying ridiculous things and doing

859
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,099
ridiculous things and we don't push back

860
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:06,920
and I think for those of you who are

861
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,259
here for those who are smarter you

862
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:11,299
almost need to push back for a type of

863
00:38:11,299 --> 00:38:14,299
herd immunity to kind of save those who

864
00:38:14,299 --> 00:38:16,519
don't know better we need to start

865
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:18,980
pushing vendors and telling them that

866
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,829
that's not the weight at all um it used

867
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:25,009
to really be the only way to roll like I

868
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:26,630
said you want to start a company that's

869
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:30,170
what you need to do um but there is some

870
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:33,859
hope people were saying forever security

871
00:38:33,859 --> 00:38:36,079
is too hard and to price sales is too

872
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,480
hard it's too hard to show value you

873
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,279
need these teams of guys in really good

874
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:43,400
suits but you're starting to see hope

875
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,950
from a few interesting places if you've

876
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,109
never seen this talk um this is a talk

877
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:50,420
by John Flynn when he worked at Facebook

878
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,140
and he spoke about Facebook's two-factor

879
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,329
authentication system called - FAC and

880
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:59,089
it's one of my favorite talks ever you

881
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:00,559
should you should go watch it if you get

882
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:02,450
a chance and and the problem they're

883
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,670
running with is they've got tens of

884
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,980
thousands of authentications happening

885
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,529
every day inside Facebook by really

886
00:39:09,529 --> 00:39:11,420
smart engineers who know how to work

887
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,730
around roadblocks that you put in front

888
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,859
of them and they needed to get two

889
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:18,259
factor authentication working and if you

890
00:39:18,259 --> 00:39:20,630
watch the talk you'll see literally

891
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,599
dozens of times where John goes so we

892
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,880
had the solution but it's not good

893
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,549
enough so we had the solution but I

894
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:30,859
think we can do better and what he does

895
00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:32,450
is he and his team keep reducing

896
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:35,150
friction they put out a solution they go

897
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,609
so we can use Geo security because it

898
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:40,430
gets us out of the gate immediately but

899
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,440
actually we need to do this better and

900
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,359
then when they deploy what's almost

901
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:47,150
optimal solution he goes - okay let's

902
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,309
watch the logs to see how this is

903
00:39:49,309 --> 00:39:51,380
actually playing out and they figure out

904
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,010
some changes and they rebuild it and

905
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:57,670
why I love it is he didn't go these

906
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:00,430
idiot users they not two-factor

907
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,470
authenticating when they know that safer

908
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:07,030
they refined it till two FAC is faster a

909
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,370
faster way to authenticate they're not

910
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,160
using to FAC and so in the end people

911
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,650
use it because it's faster it also

912
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:18,340
happens to be more secure um the other

913
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,190
way of hope we see is with some of the

914
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,690
companies that have gone massive

915
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:25,570
recently if you see slack Atlassian

916
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,270
github the whole argument that said you

917
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,490
need teams of sales guys and all this

918
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:33,130
ridiculous sales push and what these

919
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,870
companies have showed us is that

920
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:37,840
actually if you make your product nicely

921
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,940
enough if you make your product usable

922
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,700
enough engineers in the organizations

923
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,620
will pull you into the org from the

924
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,170
bottom and pull you up and these our

925
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:49,930
company is now driving massive value but

926
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,760
they literally went into these orgs

927
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,820
bottom-up just based on the product not

928
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,790
based on ridiculous sales and marketing

929
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,940
and and when you see this if you a young

930
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,620
product vendor the first thing you go

931
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,470
with is but I'm not slack but I'm not in

932
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:08,460
Silicon Valley but but we not get up and

933
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:12,790
for that in a tiny way we a reasonable

934
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:15,790
opposite example so we've not taken VC

935
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,850
funding literally reshipped hardware as

936
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,220
our first product which sounds like a

937
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,810
completely stupid thing to do and

938
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,600
sitting down in South Africa at this

939
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,210
point we've got customers on all seven

940
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:32,410
continents and and literally with one

941
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:35,080
sales guy and and the way we do it is

942
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,480
just by making sure we crazy about

943
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,010
adding value so NPS quasi insane I think

944
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:44,530
we did our first vendor briefing when

945
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:47,650
Adrian joined us so four years into it

946
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,830
because for the most part we didn't care

947
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,570
what the analysts said what we cared

948
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,640
about was whether our users were saying

949
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,880
nice things about us so the old way was

950
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,580
you could build your tech but you needed

951
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:03,910
coin driven sales you could build your

952
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:06,960
tech but you needed airport ads

953
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,180
the old way said you had to pay gardener

954
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,890
the old way said you had to have eight

955
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:13,650
touch points with every customer so that

956
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:16,260
you could make your sale and and for the

957
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,559
most part we think it's time for the old

958
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:24,210
ways to die so to sum it up if you're a

959
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:27,029
buyer you need to start demanding more

960
00:42:27,029 --> 00:42:29,250
you need to start pushing back more and

961
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,829
if you're a young company um there's

962
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:34,770
actually hope where previously we needed

963
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:37,589
to run our companies in ways we didn't

964
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:40,710
want to to reach customers more and more

965
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:43,349
you can actually go pretty far just by

966
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:45,210
caring about the product you build and

967
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:49,829
caring about your users and that's all

968
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:50,510
we've got

969
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:54,079
except for questions
