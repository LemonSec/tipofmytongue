1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,659
alright ladies and gentlemen it's Sam

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:05,250
time to take your seats please do

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,690
respect the speaker ends that your

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,280
fellow attendees and keep talking and

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,290
typing to a minimum and there'll be some

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,730
time hopefully for questions at the ends

7
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,170
but in the meantime let me pass you over

8
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,480
to excel from for tonight is going to

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,500
talk about some really interesting

10
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,150
medical IOT for diabetes and cybercrime

11
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,949
well thank you very much for joining me

12
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,380
for this last session of the day I hope

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,199
it will be worth it for you

14
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,970
it was really interesting research and I

15
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,279
I'm glad to be here at again at virus

16
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,329
built in to present it to you um so who

17
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,610
who are we this is joint research with

18
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,980
Amir lakhani and I am myself excel ably

19
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,450
the good thing is that we look very much

20
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,960
like our pictures so if you wants to

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,469
spot us

22
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,239
I guess that the pictures will be very

23
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,460
helpful for that and both of us work at

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,109
fortunates we'll jump straight into the

25
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,619
topic so medical databases are leaked

26
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:06,090
you probably know that you've heard that

27
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,070
and are on the news quite regularly

28
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,140
actually I heard that there's really

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,570
well over 400 incidents but they some

30
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,560
hospitals or other health care

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,710
institutes get compromised with

32
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,290
ransomware for instance this is quite

33
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,250
typical although this is a concern for

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,150
us as researchers we hear those news and

35
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,180
we try to react that it's not that much

36
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,210
news or interesting to the man in the

37
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,090
street I'd say because well they are

38
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,280
perhaps a little bit concerns that

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,950
somebody else might be seeing their

40
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,829
medical record but besides that they do

41
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,100
not understand how this could be of any

42
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,119
interest to cyber criminals so not that

43
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,130
much concern there for them again we

44
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,100
also have lots of vulnerabilities on

45
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,060
medical devices I kind of recall since

46
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,520
let's say March 4 something like this

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,349
year

48
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:15,639
of vulnerabilities on x-ray devices on

49
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:18,859
anesthesia machines on insulin pumps

50
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:21,530
this is all since March or something

51
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,689
like that so pretty scary stuff but I'm

52
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:29,599
saying even for some of us this just

53
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,079
looks like okay this is yet another

54
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:37,099
funky vulnerability but people don't

55
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:39,469
feel really that this is going to be

56
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:43,069
real or happen to them and that there is

57
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:47,569
really any risk there right so based on

58
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:49,819
that based on the fact that's well

59
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:52,040
people didn't really feel that concerned

60
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,000
we thought okay for our research to make

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,760
it more practical we are going to do

62
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,980
some research specifically on one

63
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,629
disease diabetes right so actually it's

64
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:08,449
not one disease diabetes as you may know

65
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:10,699
it's actually more a group of disorders

66
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:14,659
which affect well the level of blood

67
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:17,989
sugar and um it's quite complicated with

68
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,209
several types that will different

69
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:23,750
treatments for that but it affects over

70
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,019
I think over 8% 8% or 9% of the

71
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:32,930
population worldwide so well perhaps

72
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,900
some of you in the room are concerns so

73
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,439
we thought it was kind of interesting to

74
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:42,259
to do some research on and think about

75
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,479
those people when they are they have

76
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,479
diabetes and they want to use medical

77
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:51,409
IOT what threats are they facing really

78
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:59,030
okay so when you have diabetes you

79
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,519
usually have to clear to check your

80
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,519
blood sugar level regularly so then what

81
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:06,590
happens is that most of the time you

82
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,989
prick your finger get a drop of blood

83
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:12,259
and from there you measure the the

84
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:14,599
amount of blood blood glucose that we

85
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,820
have and depending on that while you

86
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,798
react for instance you inject some

87
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,490
insulin or not whatever all right

88
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,020
the problem is that you've got to do

89
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,120
that the

90
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,940
on your condition between twice-a-day to

91
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,780
10 times a day it depends very much but

92
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,330
this is really burdensome so this is

93
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,180
where I ot for once is not just the

94
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,960
funky gadget it's really helpful you

95
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,320
have sensor that will collect your blood

96
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,350
glucose and will measure measure it for

97
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,300
you and then you just you don't have to

98
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,880
prick your finger all the time you just

99
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,490
scan with a smartphone close to the

100
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,970
sensor and it gives you your current

101
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,240
glucose level right so this is really

102
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,970
kind of helpful for people so much right

103
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,120
I do not have diabetes so this is the

104
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,910
first time I'm kind of donating my body

105
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,090
to science for research so it's bit

106
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,080
scared but actually it's it's really not

107
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,360
a big thing because the needle is

108
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,720
extremely thin because for those sensors

109
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,740
you are not getting the blood the

110
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,080
glucose level from the blood vessel but

111
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,690
from institutional tissue just beneath

112
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,169
the skin right so it's not really very

113
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:44,110
painful it's actually far more difficult

114
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:49,200
to remove the sensor than to put it on

115
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,020
so this is what it looks like you get a

116
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,160
box where you basically have on one side

117
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,470
the needle and the sensor and on the

118
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,930
other the electronics you reassemble

119
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,930
both you apply it most of the time on

120
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,530
the arm and then you have an application

121
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,770
on your smartphone and you activate the

122
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,010
sensor basically this begins the

123
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,580
calibration period for the sensor and

124
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,710
then you've got to wait 60 minutes for

125
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,889
the sensor to become operational it's

126
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:26,349
kind of calibrate with your body

127
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:29,169
temperature and things like that one

128
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:32,740
hour after well you can start using it

129
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,659
and you can scan with your smartphone

130
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:37,060
and it will give you the current

131
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,710
glucose level that you have

132
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,300
and then 14 days later the sensor

133
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,550
expires you've got to remove it and buy

134
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:52,570
another one okay so well I started of

135
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,130
course one of the first thing we start

136
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,500
in those case is to tear it down

137
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,509
not that I tear down everything I get in

138
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:01,600
my hands but well in that case yes and

139
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,430
it's pretty good news because it's

140
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,759
really well designed for once you've got

141
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,910
a custom texas instrument ship on it

142
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,050
with custom firmware with custom

143
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,760
commands in there specifically built for

144
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,229
this purpose here we also see that it

145
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:22,750
has been thought for power conception so

146
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,580
that's the sensor could be stored away

147
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,639
for instance in pharmacies for months or

148
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,250
years without the battery depleting this

149
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,699
is this is a concern for them of course

150
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:38,410
so it was really nice to see at fires

151
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,970
built-in I'm not going to investigate

152
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,240
more this part here because I wanted to

153
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,910
focus as I said on practical attacks and

154
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,180
unless you are a very important person I

155
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,669
could not think of any really

156
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:55,150
interesting a hardware attack scenario

157
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,520
for that so we'll jump straight into

158
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,220
another part which is the communication

159
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,030
of the sensor with the smartphone so it

160
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,510
uses NFC Near Field Communication which

161
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,210
means that of course if you want to scan

162
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,639
your sensor you will have to be really

163
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,770
close to the sensor like a few

164
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,190
centimeters away something like that and

165
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,460
you can scan it with any NFC reader that

166
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,849
you might have as long as it supports a

167
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:33,130
0 15 693 so here you see on the picture

168
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,580
it is Hydra bus NFC I've also been

169
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,070
working proxmark

170
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:43,120
all of them work and what you can see

171
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,150
also on the picture there is so the

172
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,440
sensor is the is the the white part

173
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,360
there

174
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,640
then you've got a sponge so basically

175
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,690
the sponge is is cloning myself well

176
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,459
it's a rate replacement of my arm

177
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,680
because at some time I become a little

178
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,750
bit bored by you know having the sensor

179
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,279
myself so I took a sponge poured hot

180
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,130
sugar and the hot water on it and well I

181
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,149
get some readings that way one of the

182
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:18,779
things you can notice is that I told you

183
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,480
well we can read the sensor with any NFC

184
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,540
reader so this means actually that there

185
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,660
is no authentication there right anybody

186
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,970
can read it there's no pairing no

187
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,149
bonding whatsoever which also means that

188
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:35,640
if you are in a bus packed with people

189
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,339
and somebody is very close to you well

190
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,500
that person could probably read off your

191
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,110
measures without you knowing anything

192
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,470
about it

193
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,930
so after lengthy reverse engineering I'm

194
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,630
skipping like really a couple of weeks

195
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,329
there we managed to understand what is

196
00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:00,750
the memory for a map on the sensor and

197
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,180
how the glucose measures were being

198
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,689
stored there

199
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,820
so the glucose measures are stored in a

200
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,790
table and here you get an index in that

201
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,720
table so the trends index will give you

202
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,970
tell you that you've got to go and see

203
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,880
the sixth record and that table to get

204
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,779
the current blood glucose level that you

205
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,810
have all of these records are six bytes

206
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,870
records and then well you don't have

207
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,199
that much memory space right on the on

208
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:37,050
the device so as you have one measure

209
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,320
per minute after a while it will be full

210
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,510
so that's when you write a history

211
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,060
record and then that is why you have

212
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,959
history index to tell you go and see for

213
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,300
instance in that case third position in

214
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,620
the index we reversed lots of other

215
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,079
things in the memory map like the

216
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,910
interrupts table there the different

217
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,500
routines for the different commands

218
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,600
could be a little bit lengthy for this

219
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,690
presentation

220
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:05,890
the other thing which is perhaps

221
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,730
interesting is that we located where the

222
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,150
where time is stored in minutes so here

223
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:17,380
it says 37 it's in hexadecimal so this

224
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,340
is a little bit both below 60 so this

225
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,470
one had been warned for a little bit

226
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:29,830
less than 60 minutes on the side of the

227
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,070
mobile application it's again good news

228
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,980
because I have been investigating quite

229
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,440
lots of IOT most of the time it's really

230
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,170
crappy well it's not the case here here

231
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:46,060
it's really well implemented so most of

232
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,080
the work sits at the dalvik level that's

233
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,810
Mesa CLE where you have all the classes

234
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,980
for the application but whenever it is

235
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,230
asking to do something which is a bit

236
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,870
sensitive like collecting the glucose

237
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,350
measure or the wear time delegate sets

238
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,440
to the native library which is down

239
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,140
there in violet and that's the native

240
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,960
library the who's doing that the drop

241
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,230
there and this one is obfuscated and

242
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,860
really heavily obfuscated or at least we

243
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,450
haven't managed to be reversing yet I

244
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,630
have asked several people for help and I

245
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,980
hope that they were quite knowledgeable

246
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,180
in reversing but so far it hasn't worked

247
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,580
out either some of them are in this room

248
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,950
actually so with either Pro it doesn't

249
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,390
give any results the radar either deidre

250
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:53,140
it actually says invalid instruction at

251
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,680
some points but then you get scrappy

252
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,360
disassembly so we're a little bit

253
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,070
clueless there at what what is happening

254
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,190
but at least what we can know is that

255
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,900
the guys who implemented it did a really

256
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:09,100
good job for their obfuscation the

257
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,220
things I don't like that much is than

258
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,660
the amount of SDKs third-party kits

259
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,010
which are there

260
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,860
there are really lots of those so for an

261
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,430
application that could probably be

262
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,070
holding five Boom megabytes herself well

263
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,650
it is taking lots more of places because

264
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:34,210
it is using an Airbnb SDK and Evernote

265
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,080
so for for Airbnb I was really wondering

266
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,510
why it turns out it has nothing to do

267
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,340
with Airbnb except that they are using

268
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,340
an Adobe After Effects library which is

269
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,630
implemented by guys from Airbnb but yes

270
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,690
it's like increases the the attack

271
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,440
surface of course and finally well

272
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,530
there's um quite a big community for

273
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,960
people using this type of senses so

274
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,320
there are also open source alternatives

275
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,960
from the official application one of the

276
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,120
things I don't like either that much in

277
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,520
the mobile application is that well

278
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,500
everything that you do on the mobile

279
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,700
application therefore to check your your

280
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,980
current level if you if ever you check

281
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,820
you press a button go in a menu scan

282
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,520
yourself whatever you do it creates an

283
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,300
event records it and then every five

284
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,790
minutes or so all the bench of events

285
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,660
are sent in an anonymized format to a

286
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,540
firebase database which is remote right

287
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,920
so true it is anonymized but it really

288
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,650
attracts your every move or your every

289
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,160
movement there with the application I'll

290
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,810
leave you up to you if this is

291
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:02,260
acceptable or not so samer right for the

292
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,160
hardware Freddy okay we have an Evans

293
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,450
tracking

294
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,320
issue on the mobile application we also

295
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,450
have the issue that well the sensor can

296
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,270
be read by anybody right now what aunt

297
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,280
occation there and then we have a

298
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,560
vulnerability but this one well you'll

299
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,900
probably hear about it in a couple of

300
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,930
weeks but I can't discuss that one today

301
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,250
anyway

302
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,649
I'd say that it's not perfect but it's

303
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:33,670
not too bad either

304
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,779
and whatever basically the question that

305
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:40,720
people will ask then is okay well cyber

306
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,449
criminals are not interested in

307
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:47,670
attacking diabeetus application so is

308
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,019
this true or not

309
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:55,269
well I claim this is wrong and I prove

310
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:57,970
it by the fact that we have located and

311
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,089
found several malicious diabeetus

312
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:03,939
management applications so they pose as

313
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:06,939
diabetes management application but they

314
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:09,189
don't do only that what they don't do it

315
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:13,569
at all the art malware right a few

316
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:17,680
examples so the first one on the left

317
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,579
side is the most funny or cynical I

318
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:22,930
don't know

319
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,009
it's will compute your life expectancy

320
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:29,769
right so basically you've got a medical

321
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:32,920
form and you've got to fill that out say

322
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,490
what is your age why for your smoking or

323
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,800
not what medical conditions you can have

324
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,380
and based on that it's going to compute

325
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,389
tell me how many minutes you've still

326
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:45,639
got to live that's cool isn't it and

327
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,110
then it's going to put that as a

328
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:52,829
wallpaper on your smartphone so well

329
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:57,100
funny funny application the the bad part

330
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,990
out of that is that when you are filling

331
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,420
the medical questionnaire out of that

332
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,759
about what you don't know is that all

333
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,039
your answers are sent to a remote server

334
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:09,010
so everything is leaking out but you are

335
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,750
not to where the the application doesn't

336
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,409
say anything about that the second one

337
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:18,189
in the middle well I was supposed to be

338
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:20,589
downloading diabetes management

339
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:24,369
application instead I got an installer

340
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,890
so this is quite typical of malware on

341
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,280
Android and this one was preventing me

342
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,289
actually from getting access from the

343
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:35,440
diabetes management application and I

344
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,649
would only get access to the application

345
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:40,750
if I accepted to download some of their

346
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,460
sponsored

347
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,720
applications with of course lots of

348
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,070
advertisements and so the last one on

349
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:53,389
the left was so giving you its diabeetus

350
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:57,320
advice application I'm not able to

351
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,960
commence on the advice it is given

352
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,230
giving but what I can say is that it

353
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,600
gives you also lots and lots of

354
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,330
advertisements and in virtually tracks

355
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,750
of whatever it can so it gives out a

356
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,190
list of all the installed applications

357
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:17,090
that you have on your smartphone your

358
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,730
GPS location of course your IP address

359
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,309
so well lots of other information again

360
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:26,779
typical spot way so we are antivirus

361
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:28,549
built in this is already quite scary but

362
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,139
I know that a virus built in some of

363
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:31,850
them in the room would probably have

364
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,220
loved to see something even worse than

365
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,570
that I think we can still be quite lucky

366
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,529
that it's at at this stage what do you

367
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:44,750
really have actually to keep in mind is

368
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,960
that actually this is already very

369
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,139
interesting for cyber criminals why are

370
00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:53,389
they attacking those diabeetus

371
00:18:53,389 --> 00:18:56,870
applications well because if you have

372
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,350
diabeetus and you want to check your

373
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,960
cupboard level or how you were going on

374
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,299
and if you need those application well

375
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:08,179
you will put up with those advertisement

376
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:10,970
because you'll say oh I need it ok so

377
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,029
it's ok to have well I'll have to look

378
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:17,990
at that those ads but never mind ok and

379
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,779
the cyber criminals are making profit

380
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:23,090
out of that they they now now that they

381
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,179
can push up lots of traps on people with

382
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:28,580
diabetes because well they will have a

383
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,559
look at it and they won't well they will

384
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,360
care but they won't be able to do

385
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,990
anything about it

386
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,169
les portes I talked at the beginning

387
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:43,070
about medical databases leaking out

388
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,799
there so of course I guess that all of

389
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:48,700
you know where the ends the end

390
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,460
underground and the darknet and they get

391
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,010
sold there so here we have

392
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,450
an example of a medical database with

393
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,880
34,000 patients which is getting sold it

394
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,640
always sells at relatively a high price

395
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,010
because it facilitates really pretty

396
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,760
much identity theft so you can use the

397
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,610
data there to which is usually quite

398
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,860
accurate to create bank accounts or to

399
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,130
get into them loans insurances or are

400
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,710
the things like that another example

401
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,830
this time a larger database 200,000

402
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,210
patients in the US this one it was sold

403
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,180
underground by the dark Overlord the

404
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,950
dark of alert you might have heard of

405
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,560
them that attacker who also we don't

406
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,120
know if it's just a single person or

407
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,440
group but they they are he or she are

408
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,290
known for specifically focusing on

409
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:50,970
health care more recent this one we

410
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:56,460
found in july 2019 so an attacker a

411
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,490
cyber criminal now known as Monsta is

412
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:03,990
selling Canadian medical records online

413
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,740
and at the time we looked at that the

414
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,950
the guy already had 233 positive

415
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,230
feedbacks from people there about

416
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,540
selling their the records there so he's

417
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,870
selling the database by chunks of

418
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:25,710
hundred there the cyber criminals have

419
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,650
quite often - well to establish some

420
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,380
level of trust with the buyer right it's

421
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,390
not always very easy for them to say

422
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,230
okay I've got that

423
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,000
well the buyer has to believe that they

424
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,670
really have it so from time to time they

425
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:42,330
post online things to prove evidence to

426
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,520
prove that they do have the medical

427
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,670
records there at their hands and

428
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,270
available so here the dark overlords

429
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,670
posted an entire medical route where a

430
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:58,050
record of a person we blurred lots of it

431
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,320
because it is a real medical record of a

432
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:07,020
real person but it is really extensive

433
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,090
there so

434
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,370
here at the top there you've got the

435
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,399
list of appointments all those all the

436
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,409
appointments of the person then you've

437
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:18,480
got well the identity date of birth

438
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,659
address and things like that

439
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:25,529
diagnosis the list of medical results

440
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:29,850
MRI scans x-rays looks like that and

441
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:34,230
then medication so I can say that at

442
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,749
this point probably that cybercriminals

443
00:22:36,749 --> 00:22:40,019
know more about the medical records and

444
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:42,179
the health of that person that that

445
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:44,850
person knows himself or herself right

446
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:49,169
this is really details the other thing

447
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:51,269
that we find pretty regularly on the

448
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,159
darknet of first dartnet is pretty known

449
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:57,419
for selling drugs or sex enhancements

450
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,480
medicine right so we thought okay but

451
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,360
how about diabetes can we find medicine

452
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,659
for diabetes and the answer is yes I can

453
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:09,179
find lots of medicine out there on the

454
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,789
ground and most of the time at literally

455
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:14,999
cheap prices so this one here it's an

456
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:19,200
insulin supplement it normally costs

457
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,240
around four hundred dollars it is sold

458
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,179
underground at less than half than that

459
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:28,740
for 150 or recent screenshots it's you

460
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,309
see May 2019 this one is a fast-acting

461
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:38,309
insulin same thing sold at bargain

462
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:44,999
prices another one this one at the e at

463
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:47,369
the bottom you see the a buyer being

464
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:51,690
happy about what he or she bought july

465
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:56,669
2019 and even more so you've got some

466
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:59,340
oral medication for type 2 diabetes on

467
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,399
the the left hand side you've got a

468
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,830
humulin on the other side which is a

469
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,499
hormone which is chemically equivalent

470
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:14,639
to pancreatic insulin and then you've

471
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:17,549
got even some some some more medicine

472
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:20,490
all related to diabetes or to treatment

473
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,600
around you

474
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,630
diabeetus you can find for instance

475
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,390
preggers Belen which I believe is for

476
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:32,250
diabetic neuropathy to treat to treat it

477
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,370
you can find it for in form of pills or

478
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:40,680
directly powder the powder of course

479
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,280
there's risks behind that is it correct

480
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,720
powder the correct formula it's

481
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,410
Underground

482
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:54,470
you have no guarantee of their the other

483
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,670
medicine they're also you've got to be

484
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:59,160
careful about some of side effects so

485
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,070
there's one there so side effects were

486
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,220
suicide cancer abuse addiction whole

487
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,760
program isn't there right so be careful

488
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,930
with that are the things that you find

489
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,560
is also also forged health cards so we

490
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,710
found some for Canada there the price is

491
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:24,420
very pretty much depending on how good

492
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,090
the forgery is right if it's just scans

493
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,940
it won't be too expensive but if you

494
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,260
want really a real card just like here

495
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,930
so here it's a Blue Cross Blue Shield

496
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,620
card double-sided with plastic and

497
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,090
everything well then it's more expensive

498
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,040
and now if you don't feel like going to

499
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,930
work tomorrow

500
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:51,620
well you can buy some doctors notes

501
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,120
underground those are very cheap

502
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,330
actually and you'll have a variety of

503
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:01,830
reasons not to go and work or alibis you

504
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,320
can also get some pharmacy receipts and

505
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,160
get your insurance to to reimburse you

506
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,290
first things that you probably didn't

507
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:14,070
buy or you can get here this is for UK

508
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,990
you can get some prescriptions at the

509
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,080
pharmacy for this or that product where

510
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,090
a prescription is required for instance

511
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,160
so if I summarize you can find lots of

512
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,830
cheap diabetic treatments on the gown

513
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:35,070
underground the issue of course is

514
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:38,070
the quality right you're not certain of

515
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,960
what you're going to get I recall there

516
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,500
was a case I think in February with UK

517
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,290
students who wanted anti-anxiety pills

518
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,440
both at Underground's and they didn't

519
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,650
get that they get they got a dangerous

520
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,470
painkiller instead and I think didn't

521
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,450
end up very very well for some of them

522
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,330
the key point perhaps for this talk

523
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,820
would be that is that yes cyber

524
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,380
criminals do not care if you have

525
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,850
diabetes or any other health condition

526
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:14,550
but they do make money out of it so this

527
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,040
is one of the reasons they are that they

528
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,180
are doing it and the other thing there

529
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,360
is that well given that fact if you are

530
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,930
using your smartphone as a medical

531
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:32,550
device or for some medical thing well

532
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,890
you've got to be really very careful

533
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,720
that your smartphone doesn't get

534
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,970
infected because if it does then you're

535
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,260
going to get into all a bunch of new

536
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,150
consequences which might be far more

537
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:49,710
harmful right and I think I'm pretty

538
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,770
done I would just like to thank you I

539
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:57,570
had lots of people helping me out

540
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,870
because neither Aamir nor me have

541
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,540
diabeetus so we have contacts with

542
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,850
people patients with diabetes answering

543
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,100
very kindly to our questions telling us

544
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,070
how they were coping with it if this or

545
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,720
that would be your initiative or not

546
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,170
sames with a few nurses and and medical

547
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,120
doctors so thank you very much to them

548
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,600
and then also on the technical side as

549
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,090
you can see on the slides there's really

550
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,890
a bunch of people who helped us out for

551
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,200
this or that part because it was really

552
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,620
very technical to you to look into that

553
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:36,210
I finished if there's time for questions

554
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:40,040
I'm ready to answer
