1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,629
yes so welcome to our presentation we

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,299
are going to speak about Rio but before

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,710
that we are going to introduce ourselves

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,870
so I know Bailey from Argentina this is

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,910
my fourth various bulletin and the

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,310
second I'm a speaker and I'm really

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,720
happy for it I really like this

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,130
conference because it's all about

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,119
malware pieces on apt stuff so I'm

10
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:30,599
really happy to be here hi hello ok my

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,660
name is luciano Martin's I also must

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,870
affirm Argentina from the light it's my

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,739
first time as a speaker and it's

14
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,360
actually very good you know I've been

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,000
attending virus bulletin for past few

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,210
years and sitting there and being here

17
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,420
it's it's quite an honor for me so thank

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,160
you for that so why did we pick who you

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,280
so ryoga's as you know it's around

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,890
somewhere that includes files to make

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,459
them unaccessible ransomware became

22
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,170
really popular between 2016 and 2017 and

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,220
then suddenly we started to notice that

24
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,619
it decreased the the trend the use of it

25
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:21,600
but that didn't mean that stop to be a

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,750
dangerous thread or it it was less

27
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,380
interesting but it means studying change

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,579
the strategy and what we mean with the

29
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,650
strategy is that instead of using

30
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,890
massive campaigns targeted whoever they

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,590
could they started to be more clever in

32
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,369
the truth of targets and started to do

33
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:50,930
targeted attacks what this means is that

34
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,560
they try to focus on victims that could

35
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,110
or potentially could be able to pay the

36
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,259
ransom most of the victims that are such

37
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,719
as a subset of targeted attacks are

38
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,720
companies that get their system

39
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,910
compromised and camp a big amount of

40
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,630
money

41
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,500
to recover their files some targeted

42
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,310
attacks starts with another piece of

43
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,810
malware that does sort a that's a sort

44
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,570
of recognized reconnaissance in the

45
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,090
victims Network and try to identify

46
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,810
critical assets and then drops after

47
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,810
maybe a few days or a few more a drop

48
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,540
their ransomware in some cases they do

49
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,190
that to cover their trails some instead

50
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,450
of of course using spam campaigns they

51
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,920
use other infect your vectors such as a

52
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,160
RDP or remote desert protocol we see

53
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,420
this this kind of of turns in the the

54
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,850
ransomware families that are in the in

55
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:09,030
the presentation so in the last few

56
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,890
months as we are going to cover later

57
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,740
we notice that based on the pieces of

58
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,400
news that there are released publicly

59
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,670
this kind of trend is really effective

60
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,730
as people are really paying for the to

61
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,460
recover their files

62
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,940
so we said before we are going to focus

63
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,730
on work this this ransomware I appear in

64
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,600
of us on 2018 and the reason why we are

65
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,140
using that image is because Luke is also

66
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,790
the name of a fictional character of a

67
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,240
manga and anime series called Death Note

68
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,820
this character is a Shinigami that is

69
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:59,880
that means the a code of death and while

70
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,560
I strongly recommend you to see this

71
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,660
series because it's really awesome this

72
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,810
disparate appear at a time but is still

73
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,230
remains active and among its victims we

74
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,649
could find newspapers a public

75
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,850
institution and others the the thing

76
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,340
about react ether it's all acid toolkit

77
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,120
so everybody that is interested

78
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,199
on it come by and customize it put in

79
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,960
its own email addresses to spread it and

80
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,690
react is not only interesting for us but

81
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,090
also the national cybersecurity center

82
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,460
that in June this year released this

83
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,350
advisory yeah on that yesterday on the

84
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:53,240
keynote the National Center was actually

85
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,050
to talk Nicky Martin you know and the

86
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:08,630
Martin you know so in order to start the

87
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,810
GTP's we collected ten real examples

88
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,900
that belong to different variants based

89
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,919
on the PDB strings and we tried to match

90
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,050
those TTP's with the emitter attack

91
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,560
framework of course and what we found is

92
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,720
that most of the files were prepared to

93
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,349
run in 64 bits environments only a few

94
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:34,639
of them were prepared to run in 32 the

95
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,220
files in general remove the shadow

96
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,650
copies and backups and we only observed

97
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,700
one out of those ten files that use a

98
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,340
bat file called Windows dot watts in

99
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,830
order to do this task

100
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,080
some of them modify the ROM register key

101
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,610
adding the value SBC host and the path

102
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,660
to the executable some of the samples

103
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,960
encrypted the both master record which

104
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,190
means that the machine not a it was not

105
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,639
been able to to reboot some samples

106
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,570
other day well sorry all of them did the

107
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,460
marker Hermes to encrypt the files the

108
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,190
ransom notes are in general called will

109
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:32,539
bring me dot txt or dot HTML and I some

110
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:35,659
of them included the Bitcoin wallet and

111
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:38,659
some of they don't but they all contain

112
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:39,680
to image to con

113
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,280
like the Predators some samples appended

114
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,930
the dot R Y K extension to the encrypted

115
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,900
files and and others didn't append

116
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,020
anything at all they all contain a list

117
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,050
of services and processes that they will

118
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,889
either try to kill or stop and this list

119
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:04,160
a grow over time one of the examples had

120
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,840
a hundred and eighty for services and

121
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,190
for t'ish processes and these are all

122
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,370
related to AV companies to email

123
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,280
services to a word processing and others

124
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,110
and all analyst files tried to verify if

125
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,340
the victim machine it was a Russian

126
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,190
language in Ukrainian on in Belarus and

127
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,470
if they were they wouldn't encrypt the

128
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:39,520
files now we are going to cover a few

129
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,009
news about rebuke of course these are

130
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:46,639
not all the events that are if they

131
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,340
involve Luke but just a few of them at

132
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,470
least the ones that that we know a

133
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,490
publicly well as we mentioned before it

134
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,380
started in almost two thousand nine

135
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,650
nineteen when the malware hunter team

136
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,490
Twitter account spoke about it at that

137
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,760
time they mentioned that three companies

138
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,710
from different countries were already

139
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,610
hit and it that it was based in Hermes

140
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,539
because of the of the source code and

141
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:22,009
and and the the fact that it used the

142
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:25,000
Hermes marker in all the encrypted files

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,930
in October last year in fact a ryokan

144
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,849
factory Canadian restaurant chain and a

145
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:35,059
Water and Sewer Authority in the US and

146
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:38,779
this last attack also involved amateurs

147
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:42,260
which as there was a talk yesterday is a

148
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,950
bank intrusion from 2014 that evolved

149
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,260
into a modular malware and still

150
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,330
continues to to be used

151
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,430
then in December Luke got its VidCon

152
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,280
Willard removed from the ransom note so

153
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,650
it was more difficult for analysts to

154
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,680
know what to have a tracker on that but

155
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,240
we are going to talk about that later

156
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,120
and it was used in two attacks one

157
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,280
against a Tribune publishing group that

158
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,860
cost us disruption of the printing and

159
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,020
the delivering of newspapers in the US

160
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,260
and other against a cloud hosting

161
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,100
provider during Christmas Eve in January

162
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,430
react was like unattributed to North

163
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,430
Korea based on the fact that while

164
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,890
Hermes was attributed to the Lazarus

165
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,920
group and they realized that the source

166
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,710
code of Hermes was offering underwear

167
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,770
for him so everybody could just buy it

168
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,600
on and/or

169
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,740
obtain it and undo Hermes and then it

170
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,060
was attributed to green spider suspected

171
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,820
sell of a wizard spider which is a

172
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,880
Russian base or suspected Russian base

173
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,900
group that's Prestwick but another Bank

174
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,820
intrusion that evolved into a model or

175
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,300
malware in March this year the Jackson

176
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,180
County email system was taken down after

177
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,010
being affected by Rick in April the 3dr

178
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,080
fin six used both local Gaga and Luke

179
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,570
against a company within the engineer

180
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,780
industry and also happened an attack

181
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,260
which was called the triple threat which

182
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,050
means that they use a model to deliver

183
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,270
tripod and then triple to the liver

184
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,280
Ryoga

185
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,880
in June this year Luke added

186
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:44,040
functionality to tube that was called IP

187
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,430
blacklists a to avoid infecting hosted

188
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,840
use a an IP that was in that list and

189
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,140
also an Italian company got hit and in

190
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,140
this last mentioned in July this year

191
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,330
was when the LaPorte County got hit and

192
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,020
paid a hundred and thirty a thousand

193
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,950
dollars to record

194
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,300
funds based on the trick bought a sari

195
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,750
based on the big conscious transactions

196
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,110
since it appear in almost 2019 for

197
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,280
editors that use Rukh were able to

198
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,520
recollect for a million US dollars and

199
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:31,470
as we mentioned at some point I in

200
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,290
December last year they stopped putting

201
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,750
the Bitcoin wallet so it was really

202
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,660
difficult for us to to have a track on

203
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,470
that and the only way to to know what

204
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,070
what they were offering was to contact

205
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:53,540
them so we did yeah so we we actually

206
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,910
you know start you know for all the

207
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,460
samples that we were getting and almost

208
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,610
every day or every five days we just

209
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,800
detonate it and we get you know the

210
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,410
ransom note and then we just you know

211
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,200
email them say oh can you you know I'm

212
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,690
being hit can you just give us a hint

213
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,920
how much cost is gonna be and you know

214
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,720
trying to communicate with the operators

215
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,060
on the other side right so as you can

216
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,370
see me in this the responses which is

217
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,470
you know I have even published before by

218
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,450
I think people from tests and and some

219
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,210
of course try to it's quite polite they

220
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,540
will say you know no and we fair just

221
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,670
give it to file for you just to prove

222
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,160
that we can do it I know that and that

223
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,930
the end you know they put the command

224
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,980
the BBC wallet become boiling right and

225
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,660
if you one other thing they happen to

226
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,700
answer that we start communicating with

227
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,410
them and it was trying to like bargain

228
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,360
on the price right it's like oh this too

229
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,760
is fancy let's go something cheaper you

230
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,530
have a cheaper version of this thing and

231
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,630
we managed to get some some you know

232
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,370
some discount a little bit for a

233
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,530
ridiculous price right and to begin with

234
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,200
right but to be true we were not the

235
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,160
only ones to do it

236
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,920
right this is a news that we got you

237
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,020
know a few days ago and mid-september

238
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,900
we're also people other people overcome

239
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,640
but it's also trying to bargain on the

240
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,030
same

241
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,640
right so we're not the only ones one

242
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,590
other thing we did with all the

243
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,170
responses within within like a few

244
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:28,410
hundred emails to across time to all the

245
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,090
email address on on all the donations

246
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:34,980
that we did for riot for you is that we

247
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,740
got all the responses and then we we

248
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,230
actually managed to you know to collect

249
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,330
all of those and they we managed to

250
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,330
collect around forty to forty-five

251
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,260
different communication with the

252
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,570
operators across time and we just

253
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,280
calculate all the you know the average

254
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,650
price for all the BTC where Wallace that

255
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,200
were given to us to pay and that's kind

256
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,380
of the number that you CD there that's a

257
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,690
half more than half a million dart to

258
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,690
today's money right so 82 BTC was the

259
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,820
average price for all the communication

260
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,740
that we have for the operators so of

261
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,950
course our regular let's say person

262
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,380
couldn't be able to able to afford that

263
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,260
yeah some other things that happen to us

264
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,330
within this communication cruise time is

265
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:23,310
that we communicate with those emails

266
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,290
that you see very small sorry for that

267
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,880
they were wanted to put all of them is

268
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,080
that across time the operators that were

269
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,970
you know responding on those emails were

270
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,640
given us the same become wallet same one

271
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,080
across six months of campaigns which we

272
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,110
thought you know it's odd right and

273
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,550
celebrit oh maybe this is where like

274
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,730
really it's a subset of people here that

275
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,700
is using as a prefer you know ryuk for

276
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,350
to do some of the operations some of the

277
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,110
attacks or they probably can they are

278
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,450
trolling us that's another option but at

279
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,430
least even if they do that they are all

280
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,790
responding to those emails with same

281
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,040
vehicle while I with the same type of

282
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,430
message across time which is you know

283
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,250
some some some say it's a whole thing to

284
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,490
do right maybe it's also hope fail we

285
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,900
don't know why that but this is

286
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,560
something that is a strange

287
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,899
the same use of the same we can run it

288
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:27,699
across six months period so Chris we can

289
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:30,850
who is behind week of course we are not

290
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,220
in the attribution business but we are

291
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,439
going to talk about everything that was

292
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:38,610
mentioned around this topic so first

293
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,399
week was attributed to North Korea based

294
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,209
a because the Lazarus group is suspected

295
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:49,569
to be from that country and they also

296
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:52,110
were suspected to be behind Hermes and

297
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,300
well as we already mentioned Rio has a

298
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,449
lot of of connections with Hermes but

299
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:04,839
that was discarded a later then they

300
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,360
started to attribute it to crypto tech

301
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,579
or a user using that handle this user

302
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:15,730
claimed in underground forums that they

303
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,399
develop or he develop or she developed a

304
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,689
Hermes and that he was going to release

305
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:25,779
a new version of Hermes that happened

306
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:30,370
around June and a month after June last

307
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,610
year and I month after he he claimed

308
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,399
that in the underground forum they

309
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,069
appear a new modified version of Hermes

310
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:42,550
called Hermes a 2.1 and that was

311
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,689
supposed to be there a real ransomware

312
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:49,269
Rio was also attributed a talking spider

313
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:52,269
as we already mentioned and this group

314
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:57,430
is also attached to trick put and they

315
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,490
used it as access as a service to

316
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:06,039
deliver week oh yeah is is if you see

317
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:08,199
the first I will say let's call it the

318
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,789
first version of Rio and probably let's

319
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:15,640
say the last version when we did

320
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,880
analysis this graphical representation

321
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,189
or is trying to represent something

322
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:24,099
called the call flow just this either

323
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:27,770
image but you can see is like

324
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,500
it's not technically the same thing of

325
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,870
course this is you know the represent

326
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,550
all these cycles where their software

327
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,190
goals and all the possibilities and to

328
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,560
be true is it's clearly not the same but

329
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,140
it has some similarities in terms of you

330
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,570
know some portion of the code more than

331
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,550
in more than four or five different

332
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,070
parts this could be this could be

333
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,900
anything this could be like it's being

334
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,240
compiled with some sort some other

335
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,040
different compiler that produced some

336
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,710
other developed appreciations it could

337
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,200
be you know saw another type of

338
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,440
optimization or from the linker it could

339
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,840
be multiple things it could be like the

340
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,780
Rio people you know got access to the

341
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,300
source code then just a different cut or

342
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,400
a different compiler and builder and and

343
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,240
all that right so to be true even though

344
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,460
is use the hermit's marker in the

345
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,490
fastest Java mentioned it's not really

346
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,730
really the same thing it's very you know

347
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,560
approximate in some areas but it's not

348
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,070
really the same thing so we're trying to

349
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,590
to do some graph here because we're

350
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,350
trying to bring some let's say some data

351
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,510
some light on some of the events in

352
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,840
across time so we gather you know

353
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,480
hundreds of you know different human

354
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,120
samples we gather some other hundreds of

355
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,100
different you know ryokan will show some

356
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,020
of that well here we're trying to you

357
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,590
know project let's say project and we

358
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,540
you know this car a lot of noise that we

359
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,580
had in those several cameras we try to

360
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,260
you know see how many actually different

361
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,260
compile versions across time this across

362
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,200
one year has been you know compile

363
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,900
across you know across time right and

364
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,000
those are you know the representations

365
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,430
that it's about you know one or two

366
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,710
three you know different versions you

367
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,930
know for you know certain time you know

368
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,640
a few days one of that but then there's

369
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,600
a huge huge spike on the you know that's

370
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,590
April 2018 were a lot of you know

371
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,850
different versions who have been

372
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,220
compiled this could be you know these

373
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,170
may be the switch to a different Parker

374
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,360
which you will modify some subset

375
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,550
internally and stuff like that but it's

376
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,530
not signed

377
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,590
no exact science at all but it shows

378
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,010
represent time you know in a time where

379
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:47,200
some of the activity of the forum's were

380
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,420
claiming that this office was not yet

381
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,570
updated too much and then you know then

382
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,570
we see this spike which kind of you know

383
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,030
collides with the same argument not just

384
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,310
what we said before yeah

385
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,590
now we also try to represent you know

386
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,590
the same graphical representation same

387
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,900
idea with the compilation times on the

388
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,500
rock samples and here we see there's

389
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,320
this spread across time that probably

390
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,410
means there are not that many

391
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,910
compilation new different compilation

392
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,740
time stamp for each of the files and

393
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,620
then as I mentioned spiral research we

394
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,890
did we did you know this like 600 600

395
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,890
different files that we got and that is

396
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,140
representing its graph so as you can see

397
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,720
here when the line moves from one place

398
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,490
to another one is because they own that

399
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,290
given time and I give imperial time

400
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,420
there were no new files being compiled

401
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,790
that could be you know paul way you know

402
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,340
more a specific selection or target to

403
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,020
be able to order you know this software

404
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,230
is I sell ransomware as a service type

405
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,320
of service right so you will probably

406
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,200
not need as many produce as many because

407
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,000
you're going after a specific targeted

408
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,340
attacks right so that's kind of some of

409
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,840
the lights are trying to bring some of

410
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,420
this graph with tasers that were not too

411
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,340
many and then we actually do this and

412
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,100
this is actually in the paper in that we

413
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,560
tried to represent if there was a real

414
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,580
switch let's say switch when actual you

415
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,700
know the maker behind this it was you

416
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,090
know going after okay you know what I'm

417
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,980
it was claimed on the news you know what

418
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,840
I'm gonna i'm actually gonna switch an

419
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,550
entire thing and then i probably you

420
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,830
know give it to somebody else give the

421
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,120
code to somebody else so the continued

422
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,730
or produce anti new thing around it

423
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,890
right so we tried to again put the

424
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,660
completion time sometimes and also put

425
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,760
the compilation time so ryuk put it

426
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,170
together different colors and this is

427
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,090
where represent and the representation

428
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,460
here is exactly when it was actually

429
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,720
reported on you

430
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,240
we just you know a little bit odd you

431
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,300
know that you know that entire switch

432
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,560
there are some you know that's at

433
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,900
different colors on the Herman's going

434
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,060
back but we probably think is that if

435
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,530
there's the use of different type of

436
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,710
Parker that is not that you know is

437
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,020
producing new files within new timestamp

438
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,030
right so this is you know try to bring

439
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:14,050
some data behind what some of the news

440
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,240
were claiming and see if you know it

441
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,960
matches that you know too much is that

442
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,140
in June there is like a blank because it

443
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,110
was the time in which the crypto tech

444
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,760
handled said that he was preparing a new

445
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,830
variant and then appear a Ryoka beard

446
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,270
yeah which we don't know if the new

447
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,730
variant to be truces you know let's say

448
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,570
premise 3.0 or whatever is that Ryan oh

449
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,880
no you know we just don't know what that

450
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,910
yeah and that's it one other thing I

451
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,670
when I pointed out that some of the

452
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,740
conclusions are even we didn't hear

453
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,470
there but the more that the payload

454
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,100
itself is not like it's super mega ultra

455
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,690
you know off you skated you know to

456
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,360
labor to layer Parker you know empty

457
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,610
some box it auntie whatever I'll to you

458
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,440
when I call it there's no like that it

459
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,880
has you know a bunch of strings being

460
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,170
encrypted with this routine is

461
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,930
essentially very straightforward so that

462
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:15,250
feels to me maybe just me that you know

463
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,440
at the time this is actually dropped and

464
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,390
you know the whole thing is already

465
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,430
compromised by another vector which we

466
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,520
mentioned those may be through you know

467
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,750
a motet report

468
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,060
you know ryuk or other methods or maybe

469
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,020
to you know cell in you know remote

470
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,760
desktop credential someone and they get

471
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,980
in to steal everything everything and

472
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,140
then you know just drop the ransomware

473
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,270
ad you know last time so that you know

474
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,460
feels like you know that's that's kind

475
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,200
of odd but you know some other piece of

476
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,450
race or have more you know it's more

477
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,330
difficult to be able to to you know

478
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:53,050
reverse and do all of that right so some

479
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,360
of the conclusions here we're gonna say

480
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,899
it's like dis targeted malware and you

481
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:00,190
know there's being you know user

482
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,590
ransomware it's not stopping at all

483
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,080
they're gaining money they're getting

484
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,480
real money on some of the examples we

485
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,669
put there the Sharia state you know pay

486
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:12,279
1 million dollar into record that's a

487
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:14,409
lot of money and some others we saw in

488
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:15,970
the news that were known English here

489
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,470
but you know there there's two people

490
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,899
you know paying for those I was reading

491
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:21,399
an article last night you know there was

492
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:23,739
and there was one company they couldn't

493
00:24:23,739 --> 00:24:26,350
recover for medical you know being

494
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,899
medical data being decrypted so they

495
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:30,669
were just going through bankruptcy and

496
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,649
some other you know today there was the

497
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:35,289
news about the hospital being attacking

498
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:37,960
us so this is not stopping at all and

499
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,759
we're not saying that the will stalk

500
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:42,190
will show stuff but mister is not

501
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,359
stopping at all

502
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,049
so I mean riot keeps you know updated

503
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:50,440
and adding some new features new new

504
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,629
piece of data but in reality it just

505
00:24:52,629 --> 00:24:56,049
didn't change that much so that that

506
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:58,539
that's kind of it and it continues to be

507
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,399
you know use probably as the connection

508
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:01,899
with some other piece of our like

509
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:04,600
imitate trick but so we see that as a

510
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,309
trend we call it the cheaper the

511
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:10,629
triple-threat think so that's kinda some

512
00:25:10,629 --> 00:25:13,799
of the conclusions are not to a specific

513
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:17,409
engineering terms right yes I think we

514
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:20,529
saw them yeah the letter say five

515
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:23,320
minutes okay so probably we have some

516
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,239
yeah we have some time for questions and

517
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:28,739
thank you for being here
