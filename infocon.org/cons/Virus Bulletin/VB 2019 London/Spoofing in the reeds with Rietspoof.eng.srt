1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,879
it's my pleasure to introduce young Sean

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,690
and Lou Jean sorry Luigi no come Astra

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,000
from have asked her going to talk to us

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,639
about a relatively new malware family

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,509
called reach spoof hello everybody

6
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,150
before we start I'd like to say feel

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,590
free to take as much pictures as

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,010
possible

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,650
as you want but please make sure we both

10
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,519
look slim and nice today

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,340
oh sorry first I'd like to address

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,679
myself my name is Elam are working in

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,610
our software a small resistant me and I

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,890
work in field of security for over 10

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,540
years and my colleague Luigi you know

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,510
chemistry and I work for a bust as a

17
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,640
male model researcher and I'm still

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:58,289
students at the CTO and in Prague and we

19
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,960
had a colleague that helped with us with

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,110
our research it's autostrada is amol

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,630
researcher - he's working for a stand

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,799
yeah there's also thank you so the race

23
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,439
pool this is the malware loader we

24
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,330
discover last year and we'd like to

25
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,650
share with you as much information as

26
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,400
possible so please join us in spoofing

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,400
in the rate with the rate spoof so what

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,350
we are going to speak about today at

29
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,150
first we will show you the origin of

30
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,460
infection when we discover a smaller

31
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,700
what happened during a time trap and we

32
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,799
look on the infection change will go in

33
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,439
the deep with each of the stages you'll

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,820
start with the stage one which is a

35
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,369
Microsoft Word then stage two which is

36
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:44,270
visual basic script stage three cap file

37
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,950
and then two more stages four or five

38
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,259
which are both execute files one is a

39
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,329
drop bot which communicate with C&C

40
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,070
server and the last one is a door odor

41
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,030
at the beginning of this year we

42
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,710
released a blog post for the detail

43
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,189
about a rich poof and few days later we

44
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,719
discovered something early change so we

45
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,939
will look what happened after we

46
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,340
released our blog post and of course at

47
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,780
the end your projects of summary and

48
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,590
maybe they're gonna be time for

49
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,500
questions and hope maybe some answers

50
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,610
it's not like starboard to original

51
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,800
fiction this was the right interesting

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,830
for each modern family so there is proof

53
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,410
we discovered his mother older and all

54
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,560
this 2018 the first versions was obvious

55
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,660
that the first version were probably the

56
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,520
death files homeland or test files

57
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,160
because there was no application at all

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,070
it was really easy readable each thing

59
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:40,040
was invisible etc before January 2019

60
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,420
there was like an average one new

61
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,710
version per month

62
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,830
they started in confiscation they

63
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,560
starting some more stuff doing that but

64
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,570
the biggest boom was in the January till

65
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,260
the end of February 2019 the public

66
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,970
gardens changed almost daily updates

67
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,500
with smaller or bigger changes this

68
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,350
Marvel or is more likely malicious

69
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,620
loader communicate with us

70
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,970
IP range only with its CNC server so we

71
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,870
know this is targeted to us after all

72
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,880
data bias we were able to discover the

73
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,480
samples were share through the Skype

74
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,239
insta messages and emails go it's really

75
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,310
target attack

76
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,890
so let's look on the process tree I'll

77
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,989
just in Rauscher tell you what's going

78
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:33,600
on during the whole attack it's all

79
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,950
stars we do merge with a spam email

80
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,959
which contains the malicious windows

81
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,260
word document this work has a dropper an

82
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,489
executor for the visual basic scripts it

83
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:51,239
changed I'm slightly or more but

84
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,510
basically the BBS then drop the cup file

85
00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:00,420
unpack up file and run the drop bot with

86
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,860
just a simple file at the beginning

87
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,610
which communicate with the C&C server

88
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,320
has ability to download some additional

89
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,350
stuff so I started with the Microsoft

90
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,970
Word this Microsoft or actually it's

91
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,589
pretty common these days the malware is

92
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,798
spread to spam emails so it's not so

93
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,500
surprised so same way here they usually

94
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,479
come on social engineer it was really

95
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,560
stupid just okay

96
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,240
please run amok arose and

97
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,720
we'll see something girls and in war as

98
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,870
a doper and runner for the VBS what was

99
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,990
interesting when Numa co-star running

100
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,139
the first thing for the date it changed

101
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:41,880
the value of show hidden tech to true

102
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,300
and the emergency exit map text appear

103
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,160
to victim it sure this is some

104
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,289
similarity maybe you know for example

105
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,539
the gun crap was shared with the

106
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:53,970
Microsoft Word documents which also try

107
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,400
to use the emergency exit map but

108
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,599
although I will reverse a lot of

109
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,819
Microsoft words related to gun crap we

110
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:04,860
were not able to find any relation

111
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,400
between the read spoof and can crop and

112
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,860
in this case the document contained the

113
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,509
visual basic script we just embedded a

114
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:17,900
64 bit string and code it in hex

115
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,240
he was just encoded no it was just

116
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,030
decoded drop and run through we script

117
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,840
dot exe during our investigation we

118
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,520
discover many a probably fake loose

119
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,880
because there are some really messy for

120
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,740
example in the Microsoft where they use

121
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,770
the French Wars for the error but it

122
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,680
really seems like only the fake loose so

123
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,759
let's move to do with your basic script

124
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,520
what is interesting actually each

125
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,060
version even the diff files test files

126
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,889
where digitally sign is the same for the

127
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:55,819
VBS and for all next stages

128
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:57,569
everything was signed with the new

129
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:00,419
certificates and they were paying

130
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,009
attention you don't know why they spied

131
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:04,469
provide a lot of time lot of money to

132
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:06,690
sign everything even it was just a

133
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,960
diphthong but once we found something

134
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,710
very interesting

135
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,139
this digital signature if you look on

136
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,639
the email it contains some random

137
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,500
Russian no not random but the Russian

138
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,060
name which is brought against a clue

139
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,319
it's I to at email a true but what's

140
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,659
more interesting if you check the name

141
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:29,819
spices say ok why they are using this 9

142
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:33,360
and we probably get a clue we take the

143
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,270
author's play a lot of this game do you

144
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,630
know it yeah I see someone guys know it

145
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,380
sure is really good game or if they

146
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,159
don't play it

147
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,990
they maybe write a lot from Frank

148
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,630
Herbert and maybe they hope that he who

149
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,570
controls the spice control the universe

150
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,360
but fortunately did not happen yet so we

151
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,960
hope it won't change well and I started

152
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,639
the digital signatures actually what was

153
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,680
interesting to issuer in this case were

154
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,199
just two companies was the Komodo and

155
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,500
sexy go reaching the reason why they are

156
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,000
using these two companies because

157
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,779
certificates are not really pricey and

158
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:14,070
it took them a long time even if we

159
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,860
report the certificate using malicious

160
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,250
stuff to revoke that so I guess that

161
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,050
occurs a lot of time to work this

162
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,289
digital signature with a bit before it's

163
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:30,089
revoke Baidu sure the main purpose of

164
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:32,219
the visual basic script in this attack

165
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:37,259
is to drop an expand cap file so if

166
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:38,940
there is just a simple function you

167
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,219
start reading itself from define offset

168
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:47,339
and to the core it decode the cap file

169
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:49,919
which is then dropped into the into the

170
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,779
target computer and through the built-in

171
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:58,729
tool which is expanded to xe8

172
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:03,240
unpack with a simple parameter and it

173
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,120
unpack this cup file into the execute

174
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,550
file they use the random names but in

175
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,580
each case is they add the number of

176
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,130
processor number into the name and of

177
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,610
course when the excel file is dropped

178
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,389
the Visual Basic executed at first

179
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:26,370
what's happened there will be a script

180
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,880
check if you use race admin it's not my

181
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,159
party I was bit surprised it's so easy

182
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,500
to check if the users add line you can

183
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,839
just try to read this register key it's

184
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,510
accessible only for admin so there was

185
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,520
it was so easy for them to define if you

186
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,370
use this up man and they say ok user is

187
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,910
admin that first

188
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,670
cool well they call next function say

189
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,130
the current name into the server

190
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,430
variables and then they change the day

191
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,820
to the first of the January 2100 or nine

192
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,870
in the later versions it was 2199 this

193
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,000
probably too broke some sand boxes and

194
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,680
stuff like that why it's not really

195
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,770
something what drive work good but let's

196
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,560
say and then they spawn the server

197
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,480
command lines

198
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,660
and through that they run the drop both

199
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,320
and after it they just change the date

200
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,400
back to so nothing is going on I don't

201
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,050
think this is really something which can

202
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,510
really break some behaviors actions but

203
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,920
maybe they hope it will but in case the

204
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,020
user is not admin they try to use

205
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,650
something else

206
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,890
so again spawn of several common lines

207
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,040
with your arguments and it spawned

208
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,800
scheduled tasks DXE with the parameter

209
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,460
which say after one minute run the

210
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,050
microscope windows don't object helper

211
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,780
which is in fact the drop bot this is

212
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,840
the way how they can break some again to

213
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,030
be here on the behavior detection or the

214
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,760
chain the whole chain they can break

215
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,470
sometimes and we also find in few

216
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,190
versions they try to use the simple link

217
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,520
file which was dropped and then executed

218
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,850
to run to drop both they were a tested

219
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,220
some stuff like that to mate we probably

220
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,720
stay under the radar

221
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,990
what is not working much so the cup file

222
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,180
you mention it many times

223
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,310
the cup was in effect use in each of the

224
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:35,500
versions but with the cap we have like

225
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,360
two hypotheses why they are using the

226
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,990
cap file it may be anti behavior like

227
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,580
maybe against the behavior detection

228
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,430
because when you are of the BBS

229
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,350
we should Rob executable file you do

230
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,070
something let's B color right if we drop

231
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,290
the zip file maybe but the benefit of

232
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,810
cap file it's really easy to expand it

233
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,290
with the built-in tools in Windows and

234
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,089
now I would like to ask Lou you to

235
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:05,829
please yeah thank you

236
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:10,360
so as my colleague said the vbscript

237
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,800
dropped the ball as you can see on the

238
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,949
slide here there is a really simple call

239
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:24,399
graph of sorry graph that the it's

240
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,240
describing the functionality of the drug

241
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,350
bought it first connect to the CNC

242
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,949
servers the since is the under sample

243
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:38,499
all the samples that we analyzed all IP

244
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:40,749
addresses of the CNC server was

245
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:44,470
hard-coded on the sample and starts to

246
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,300
communicate there there is a den

247
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,939
handshake with the CNC server this

248
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:53,430
handshake it's it's a good really simple

249
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,149
after the handshake it start it start

250
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:01,300
the communication where encrypted there

251
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,519
is a client hello to the C&C server just

252
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,809
the pink if CNC server is alive then

253
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:11,559
infected bought sends the some ID to the

254
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:15,639
C&C server and this ID is a MAC address

255
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,980
of the infected bot and this MAC address

256
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,509
is then hashed by md5 and sure CNC

257
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,509
server can respond with the come a bit

258
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:27,970
okay or can respond with the more

259
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,179
powerful commands it that means that it

260
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:33,850
can download all files gather piece

261
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,839
informations start processes or

262
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,300
self-destruct it's self insert it

263
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,730
self-destruct itself or delete the

264
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,199
specific file it has gone fencing based

265
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,749
IP addresses that means that it worked

266
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:56,170
just on American IP ranges so as I said

267
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,259
we analyzed a lot of samples and we saw

268
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:03,699
lot of modifications so I will divide it

269
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:09,040
and two main modification that will the

270
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,809
the difference between this modification

271
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:14,649
is the communication protocol so then we

272
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:15,059
see

273
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:18,869
a commercial application in some version

274
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:22,849
were not and some that there was

275
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:29,369
discussion then some commands were

276
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:32,719
scrapped so it there wasn't there and

277
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:37,739
this is a timeline where I will tell you

278
00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:41,789
about the main modification really the

279
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:44,489
malware out all the modificated of

280
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:49,079
modification he it the mottos the tried

281
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:57,479
a lot of lot of stuff and so but let's

282
00:13:57,479 --> 00:14:00,749
say that this was the daily

283
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:03,479
modifications so this is a main timeline

284
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:10,889
and we first we saw January 15 there as

285
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:14,219
you can see there was a application

286
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:17,609
placeholders but it for me it doesn't

287
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:19,919
make sense you know you see modification

288
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,399
placeholders there there but the the

289
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,249
command which is run in this situation

290
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:31,999
is is not obfuscated so then in this

291
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:34,499
this version they use the communication

292
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:38,359
protocol version one about the

293
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:41,909
communication protocol versions I will

294
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:45,239
describe it later so then we saw January

295
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:51,179
17 as you can see here there is a very

296
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:54,809
simple application the string

297
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:57,329
obfuscation it Delphis cade the the

298
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:03,629
bytes with the EXR then he had as a

299
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:08,309
service it means that the mouth the

300
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:13,979
vbscript can actually with the right

301
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,949
parameters can execute the bot as a

302
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:22,699
service so so yeah and then he had the

303
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:26,110
communication protocol version 2

304
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:34,250
then on 22 January he he added the

305
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,610
scheduled tasks so as a my colleague

306
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,759
said in the first case he had on the

307
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,689
vbscript

308
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:46,850
and this case is its it he they it add

309
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,769
to the eggs of file and yeah it can

310
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:54,319
start with the scheduled tasks if the

311
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:57,769
Maurer doesn't have admitting privileges

312
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:01,550
it will run as a scheduled task and and

313
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,060
so on

314
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:07,939
so in 23 January the obfuscation were

315
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:11,889
scrapped as you can see here there is a

316
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,050
clear string clear commands you can see

317
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,670
and they in this version they just use

318
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,360
few commands so I think it was four

319
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,319
commands there instead of eight and they

320
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,149
return again to the communication

321
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:32,569
protocol version one now I'm going to

322
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:35,480
I'm going to tell you about the

323
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,800
difference between communication

324
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,379
protocol version one and two so in

325
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:41,300
communication protocol version one it's

326
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,569
it was very simple they communicate over

327
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:49,189
TCP socket they were a handshake

328
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:53,649
the handshake was quite simple - so the

329
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:59,209
the client and the server they generate

330
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:01,819
the random bytes and then send to each

331
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:04,059
other generated the random bytes and

332
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:06,829
generated the random bytes their doctor

333
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:14,119
and they hashed by shot - and this how

334
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:17,869
it was created the key about

335
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:22,520
initialization vector after after the

336
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,630
key the disk is hashed by md5 and that's

337
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,659
how they created a suggestion vector so

338
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:33,590
this was the parameter for AAC CBC for

339
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,460
secure communication so from now the

340
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,559
hello were

341
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:44,210
and as I said clients client sense to

342
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:49,249
the C&C server the the commands ID that

343
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:52,309
contained the MAC address dashed by md5

344
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:56,619
now communication protocol over root 2

345
00:17:56,619 --> 00:18:00,980
so it communicates over HTTP protocol in

346
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,249
this case they avoids a handshake so it

347
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,960
it's all samples that we analyzed the

348
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,799
the they had just this hard-coded string

349
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,869
from this hard-coded string it's hashed

350
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:21,289
by a two and created the key and about

351
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:23,539
any session vector they're all really

352
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:25,789
simple there we'll just sort two

353
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:31,159
constant bytes in the sample and they

354
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:35,059
say is used a a CCBC for secure

355
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:40,609
communication the the bots and get

356
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:43,669
requests to the census server so as you

357
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:47,419
can see there is a content md5 where the

358
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:51,379
message or outside the command it's

359
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:55,789
encrypted by AAC and then decode encoded

360
00:18:55,789 --> 00:19:01,789
by base64 but there was still one thing

361
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:08,119
that in all bots that we saw there used

362
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,759
communication protocol version 2 but

363
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,769
there will still present communication

364
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:18,019
protocol version 1 he is still present

365
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:20,749
therefore case when the HTTP proxy is

366
00:19:20,749 --> 00:19:23,139
used in the infected

367
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:30,769
PC so now the bot which you saw it was

368
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,019
very simple it downloads the other stage

369
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:36,049
which is the downloader these downloader

370
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,749
starts to any initiate the interim

371
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:42,109
protocol it's a protocol just to enter

372
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:44,989
authenticate with the C&C server it

373
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:48,400
first so it starts first to that they

374
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,200
it was the security t2 dll then it finds

375
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,000
out the security function table

376
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,470
structure is a dispatch table that

377
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,279
contains the pointer to the functions

378
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:06,100
related to the entire API functions yes

379
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,370
in this case two it has IP address

380
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,710
hard-coded in all sample in that all

381
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,520
centers that we analyzed all hard call

382
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,850
it a paralysis

383
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:22,899
then after success initiate interim

384
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:25,659
protocol it starts communicate through

385
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:35,140
the credit channel and and the ball

386
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:40,570
received from the C&C server the the

387
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:45,309
payload and the payload were executed

388
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:50,250
wirelessly so it worked it was quite

389
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:55,830
let's say interesting in some cases that

390
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,950
actually it's created the pipe and he

391
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,240
wrote the all the receive data from C&C

392
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,340
server he wrote to the pipe and from the

393
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,330
pipe he created the process and that

394
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,510
process is a finite payload now my

395
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,419
colleague will tell you about what

396
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:21,690
happened when we published our block

397
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,539
eulogy so we get all these data and we

398
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:27,700
cite of course to publish visitor to

399
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,190
share our information but raise

400
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,559
awareness to everyone he was a bit

401
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,690
happened at the 16 February we published

402
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:37,330
a blog post was our surprise that few

403
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:41,020
days later the 21st of February we

404
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,870
receive completely new version alexei

405
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,700
was not completely new version because

406
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,149
first step first time the game starts we

407
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:53,399
do some email warrior cumin VBS cup file

408
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,029
it was the same

409
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:57,100
what was our surprise that from the cup

410
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,710
file as usual was not unpack the exit

411
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,220
Google file

412
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,460
but the VBS script it was wrong through

413
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,159
scheduled tasks they just get rid of

414
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,140
some functionalities Sara

415
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,220
well sure that those guys they really

416
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,510
care was going in the world of the

417
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,030
security because the traction was really

418
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,600
fast

419
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,900
I was interesting you expanded VBS

420
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,570
actually not all the functionality of

421
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,110
the drop boat and the downloader at

422
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,580
first is get information about the

423
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,370
targeted computer so yeah computer and

424
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,059
I'm processing defier username HP's

425
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:37,309
information to the md5 get the first

426
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:41,059
four bytes and use it with the computer

427
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,669
name as a parameter for communication of

428
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:46,970
the C&C server as identifiers the CNC

429
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,850
several others was again hard-coded they

430
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:52,280
didn't really make much try to do you

431
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,809
some DG or something like that really

432
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:55,610
hard code it was probably written

433
00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:01,760
because they changed it a lot etc this

434
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,440
VBS crepe also had a function to delete

435
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,210
everything or wipe out everything from

436
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,840
the target computer just just stay safe

437
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,929
a bit or delete the samples from

438
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:17,150
computer and the second function

439
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,309
it was the same function as was before

440
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:20,480
able to do the unloader

441
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,450
it was the download and run file so it

442
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,150
just received from the C&C server the

443
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:30,140
two part to command download with the

444
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,049
URL and the file name and just to the

445
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:35,809
simple get you don't load the file save

446
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:40,370
the file into the time and run it this

447
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,440
show has the guys behind they are really

448
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,059
skilled with VBS because they were able

449
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:46,940
to rewrite the function of the P files

450
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,840
into the VBS really fast and they really

451
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,530
react was going on the security so let

452
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,799
me do summarize or talk a bit i was the

453
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:01,309
low activity in 2018 and when we

454
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:03,890
discovered his mother and activity has

455
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:06,740
sped up in january 2000 ID till the end

456
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,929
of february was like we say it was from

457
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:12,230
monthly updates to daily updates

458
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,060
what is it Earl interesting that after

459
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,100
we were able to block it

460
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,850
even with the new VBS file since then

461
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,740
there is no activity behind the read

462
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:28,230
spoof maybe we were able to piss them

463
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,690
off enough to stop using this malicious

464
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:34,770
payload loader or they are working on

465
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,870
something more interesting or they are

466
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,100
stay under the radar but we open up

467
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,320
because we are able to track them since

468
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,020
early do deaf files till the production

469
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,460
version 3 poof usually five stages mono

470
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,580
loader for droppers one with the boot

471
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,670
functionality and as I mention is what's

472
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,530
very interesting that every single file

473
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,540
even the Deaf files and theft's tests

474
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,230
files were digitally signed so you can

475
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:05,070
see those guys behind they rely spent a

476
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,410
lot of time they invest some money into

477
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:11,130
it so that's why we are bit aware that

478
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:16,650
we don't see nothing these days also the

479
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,690
communication protocol was extended in

480
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,370
me to generic which is not so come on

481
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,130
and especially when they keep default by

482
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,330
communication protocol one in some

483
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,970
special cases like the HTTP proxy is on

484
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:31,020
the target computer and again we we

485
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,910
speak a lot on conferences that sharing

486
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:36,270
is caring but sometimes we can see that

487
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:39,480
Marvin altars are really watching was

488
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,720
going on they checking the blog post

489
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,700
probably the checking maybe the Twitter

490
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,670
because they can react really fast when

491
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:50,070
the security companies release this

492
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,560
information so thank you very much first

493
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,600
time and now I hope you have some
