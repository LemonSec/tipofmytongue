1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,650
hello everybody I think you so much for

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,480
coming hanging out with me today

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,180
and thank you too CTN virus bulletin for

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,309
hosting tips because this is really

5
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:09,990
awesome that we can have this event

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,730
um so I'm here today to talk to you

7
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,980
about the nexus between ot and IT threat

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,719
intelligence just a little bit about

9
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,730
myself my name is Selena Larson I am a

10
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,199
cyber threat intelligence analyst at

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,180
Drago's we are an industrial control

12
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,619
system cybersecurity company

13
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,330
so my team threat intelligence team

14
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,539
specializes in ot threat intelligence in

15
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,460
a previous life I was a cyber security

16
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,320
and privacy journalist and it's pretty

17
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,300
cool that a lot of the same skills as a

18
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,399
journalist map very nicely and to

19
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,190
becoming an intelligence analyst so I

20
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,290
want to get started with this story a

21
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,329
tale of two hackers so here on the left

22
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,210
you have a cyber Dino or a PT 3 billion

23
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,910
BC depending on which group or company

24
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,770
that you're talking to this is a

25
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,449
financially motivated hacker who

26
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,300
executes a ransomware attack so in terms

27
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,800
of their TTP's what are they gonna do

28
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,239
they use spearfishing to gain initial

29
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,100
access they're gonna deploy Robin Hood

30
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,050
of ransomware and move through the

31
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,930
network via PS exec this adversary is

32
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,099
gonna be a cyber criminal they're

33
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,900
interested in making money off of your

34
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,390
network the IT business network and

35
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,729
again the target is IT focused business

36
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,280
operations but on the other hand you

37
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,830
have this cyber on cyber brontosaur this

38
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,180
is a different adversary they're gonna

39
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,040
be interested in disrupting electric

40
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,290
distribution distribution so how are

41
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,040
they going to do that

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,930
well again spearfishing to gain initial

43
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,360
access to the IT network a little bit

44
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,520
similar but then they are going to get

45
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,509
in there and they're either gonna use

46
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:33,060
stolen credentials or probably get

47
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,200
through the network differently but

48
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,820
they're gonna look for a dual honed

49
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,180
IT OT box basically something that can

50
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,189
allow them to pivot from the IT network

51
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:42,990
to the OT network once there they're

52
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,960
going to find their target host and

53
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,020
deploy very customized malware ICS

54
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,329
specific tools and capabilities to

55
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,040
achieve the ultimate destruction within

56
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,649
the OT so who is this adversary well

57
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,020
there can be sufficiently resourced

58
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,549
likely sponsored by an entity who wants

59
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,310
to further political means and the

60
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,890
target here again initial access in the

61
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,439
IT but their ultimate goal is to use

62
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,508
that to facilitate OD access and

63
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,020
potentially turn off the lights so why

64
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,770
does this matter

65
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,750
well the way that the companies detect

66
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,000
and respond to and prevent attacks from

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,470
each of these different personas is

68
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,270
going to vary based on the environment

69
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,640
risk analysis and business decision so

70
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,110
that means I've got intelligence

71
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,850
practitioners the stuff that we're

72
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,430
hunting for and analyzing might start

73
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,050
off similar but then you'll realize that

74
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,300
everything from the motivation to the

75
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,670
TTP's to the actions on objectives are

76
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,170
going to vary between whether you're

77
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,210
talking about an IT or an OT focused

78
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,580
adversary and also the threat

79
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,320
intelligence that we actually produce is

80
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,120
going to be utilized differently again

81
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,460
even if a company they're receiving the

82
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,960
same type of threat intelligence it's

83
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,410
going to be diffused differently based

84
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,170
on whether they're OT or IT but what are

85
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,400
we even talking about when we talk about

86
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,880
ot operational technology is thought of

87
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,010
as mission critical IT within the ICS

88
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,110
this is the hardware and software that

89
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,300
controls and monitors operations in your

90
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,040
ICS environment we're talking about the

91
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,920
domain controllers and Windows PCs and

92
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,960
we talk about ICS again another acronym

93
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,180
here this our industrial control system

94
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,010
this is basically an umbrella term for

95
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,959
the software and hardware that's gonna

96
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,970
control and automate the industrial

97
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,910
processes your ICS environments can vary

98
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,280
a lot we have critical infrastructure so

99
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,959
you have your electric utilities oil and

100
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,000
gas but then you have pharmaceuticals

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,880
manufacturing stuff like that and just

102
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,380
as a quick caveat drago's doesn't

103
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,900
actually focus on health care at all so

104
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,030
we don't necessarily include that in

105
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,030
like those sort of health devices in our

106
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,540
assessments so the cyber security

107
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,180
principles and the security that threat

108
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,100
intelligence is going to help inform and

109
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,400
drive it's gonna vary between IT and ot

110
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,400
focus entities so within the IT you have

111
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,230
the CIA triad right yeah confidentiality

112
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,050
integrity and availability so you want

113
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,220
to be able to keep your information

114
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,690
private you don't want it to fall into

115
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,450
the wrong hands you want it to be

116
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,040
trustworthy you want to know that you

117
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,270
can trust in the information that's

118
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,580
there and you want it your networks and

119
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,709
services to be available you don't want

120
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,668
things to go down that isn't I don't to

121
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:19,440
say that it doesn't apply in OT the CIA

122
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,570
triad necessarily but it's not really

123
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,390
comprehensive enough to really describe

124
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,000
what we're talking about

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,610
in terms of OT targeting adversaries and

126
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,450
what they can actually do so my my boss

127
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,620
the VP of threat intelligence

128
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,930
Sergio Calderon II came up with the

129
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,450
vices model and this is a view

130
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,970
input/output control engineering and

131
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,430
safety so we're talking about view this

132
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,860
refers to the ability to actually

133
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,410
monitor or read the system state input

134
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,610
output is everything from the

135
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,890
communications as well as the actual

136
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,930
physical relationships between systems

137
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,950
right so that could mean in the OTS a

138
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,419
little bit different than the IT if you

139
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:02,540
are a manufacturer and you're shipping

140
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,640
and logistics is disrupted down the line

141
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,580
you might actually stop manufacturing so

142
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,020
that's kind of an input-output issue

143
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,600
that you don't really see an IT and then

144
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,520
you have control so this is the ability

145
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,000
to actually modify a system state that

146
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,470
could be a device continues to operate

147
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,740
but the controller engineer can't do

148
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,360
anything about it maybe it's not

149
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,180
operational at all and then when we talk

150
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,280
about engineering so this is the actual

151
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,440
physical controls and specifications of

152
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,650
your non digital assets so basically how

153
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,930
fast can a centrifuge spin before it

154
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,900
breaks and then we talk about safety and

155
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,330
so when you're talking to Oh tea and ICS

156
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,460
folks this is usually going to be the

157
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,130
most important piece we hear about safe

158
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,660
and reliable power we care about

159
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,780
environmental safety human safety food

160
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,940
and drug safety all of these things

161
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,640
really play a role there and potentially

162
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,610
disrupting the safety of an OT system

163
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,990
could potentially cause really

164
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,350
catastrophic results I want you to talk

165
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,390
about a couple common myths and

166
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,490
misconceptions when it comes to ot and

167
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,770
threat intelligence this is the idea

168
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,919
that ICS networks are air-gapped know um

169
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:14,780
typical ot systems will have a

170
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,150
demilitarized zone that you have to kind

171
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,130
of jump through to get there oftentimes

172
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,600
you'll have folks going through from the

173
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,550
corporate to the plant bringing our

174
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,600
laptops and they're walking through

175
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,760
there you have vendors that have to go

176
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,380
in there either for maintenance or

177
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,080
engineering purposes sometimes that's

178
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,580
whether you're like VP ending in or

179
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,260
they're just physically in there to

180
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,159
install firmware other updates

181
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,529
and this other idea is that ot staff

182
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:42,029
don't care about security they don't

183
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:44,279
patch and they won't scan that's not

184
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,469
true either they do actually care about

185
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:48,149
it a lot but they also care about the

186
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:51,239
consequences so what's gonna happen if I

187
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:53,669
issue this patch to my plant

188
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:56,699
is it going to take this machine down

189
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,259
that'll cost millions of dollars a day

190
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,929
for my company also is this

191
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:02,369
vulnerability scan gonna potentially

192
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:06,809
break something you have a patch cycles

193
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:08,459
that are planned out sometimes months or

194
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:10,589
years in advance and if something drops

195
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:12,300
right before patch cycle it's probably

196
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,529
not going to be incorporated in there

197
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:15,449
because they need time to sort of test

198
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:16,619
it and validate it and make sure it

199
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:19,080
won't screw anything up and then you

200
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,699
have this idea that ot systems are easy

201
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,539
to hack because we see them on showed in

202
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:26,669
seeing something on shodhan for instance

203
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:28,800
in HMI doesn't necessarily indicate a

204
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,599
vulnerability to an actual consequence

205
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:34,289
so ot ICS SCADA devices they have a lot

206
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:36,089
of digital and safety controls built in

207
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,589
them especially when we're talking about

208
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:39,029
critical infrastructure like electric

209
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:41,819
utilities or oil and gas so modifying

210
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,139
something or playing with something

211
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,179
that's on the open Internet might do

212
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:47,159
something it might not do anything at

213
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:47,819
all

214
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,469
and a lot of times what you're seeing on

215
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,269
shodhan are potentially ICS honeypot

216
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:52,679
things like that

217
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:55,439
so I just kind of want to get that out

218
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,209
of the way here but that's not to say

219
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:58,259
that you can't use it for threat

220
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,449
intelligence right it's really useful in

221
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:03,449
terms of Osen potentially but just

222
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,559
because it's there it doesn't mean

223
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:05,789
you're gonna be able to turn off the

224
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:08,969
lights there are a lot of similarities

225
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:10,919
between the two IT no t threat

226
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,839
intelligence so the goals of start

227
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,669
intelligence on both sides are the same

228
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:16,619
right like we want to obtain actionable

229
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:19,079
information on these adversaries so that

230
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,759
defenders and organizations can reduce

231
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,559
harm through better security decision

232
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:25,679
making some additional similarities

233
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,899
you'll see similar tactic tactics

234
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:31,550
techniques and procedures you have

235
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,380
spearfishing

236
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,578
watering hole attacks these are these

237
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:37,799
are common TTP's that you're going to

238
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,929
see from ot focused adversaries with the

239
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:43,169
initial initial access vector again IT

240
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,120
networks communal access vectors like we

241
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,009
kind of saw with the cyber brontosaur

242
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:48,959
and they're gonna use that to facilitate

243
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,220
their ot network access

244
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,350
there's this idea of threats to IT

245
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,880
networking infrastructure that can

246
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,460
impact ICS a good example of that

247
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,980
actually is this quote-unquote cyber

248
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,840
event that happened at no luck and the

249
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,150
electric utility back in March in the

250
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,710
United States some of you might have

251
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,180
heard about it recently because new

252
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,710
information actually came out about that

253
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,050
and the cyber event itself was actually

254
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,540
a vulnerability in the web interface of

255
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,100
this utility that an attack was actually

256
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,750
able to modify and cause a denial of

257
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,790
service brief disruption of

258
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,680
communication between field devices and

259
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,930
the sites and from the sites and the

260
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,360
control center so again that was

261
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,010
something that was a that was IT related

262
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,740
that did actually impact the OT there

263
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,630
and then you have things like

264
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,670
engineering workstations human-machine

265
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,580
interfaces data historians OPC servers

266
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,530
these are gonna run Windows operating

267
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,600
systems you're gonna see familiar OS

268
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,580
there it's not could be Windows 10

269
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,510
probably but you will see that familiar

270
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,990
OS and then IT ransomware can infect and

271
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,300
disrupt the OT this is something that we

272
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,980
have seen certainly recently as well um

273
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,750
and I'm gonna talk about that in just a

274
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,260
second there are also a lot of

275
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,120
differences when it comes to IT no T

276
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,070
threat intelligence the adversaries are

277
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,560
different even among this potential

278
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,910
similar groups you have those that

279
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,950
specialize in IT and specialize in OT

280
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,290
the consequences of cyber attacks are

281
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,330
different successful attacks can cause

282
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,890
catastrophic human and environmental

283
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,700
harm and this I actually is a personal

284
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,410
reason why I really like my job is

285
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,790
because I feel like the threat

286
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,130
intelligence that we produce could

287
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,590
potentially be used to block or prevent

288
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,230
a very catastrophic event from happening

289
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,220
someone might not get hurt the

290
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,450
environment might not be completely

291
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,050
destroyed

292
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,900
so that's kind of a cool outcome of the

293
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,470
work that we do ICS our intelligence is

294
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,090
gonna fall into three categories

295
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,440
you have your interested adversary

296
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,840
direct ICS threat and indirect ICS

297
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,460
threat we're talking about interested

298
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,960
adversaries this would be intelligence

299
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,880
on activities of adversaries that are

300
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,740
known to have a very specific interests

301
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,810
and control systems operations networks

302
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:57,130
or ICS organizations it might vary based

303
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,510
on who you're talking to but at Drago's

304
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,190
we include adversaries that don't

305
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,260
necessary necessarily possess an ICS

306
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,940
specific capability

307
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,500
that means they don't necessarily have

308
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,570
ICS specific malware but they have shown

309
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,690
a sustained and specific interest in ICS

310
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,000
organizations an example an example of

311
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,710
this would be an activity group that we

312
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,990
call Magnum they target oil and gas in a

313
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,030
variety of different geographies but

314
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,070
recent activity would actually included

315
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,750
an uptick in password spraying targeting

316
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,910
oil and gas following some of the recent

317
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,430
tensions in the Middle East and then

318
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,020
you're going to have your direct ICS

319
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,120
impact and so this would be intelligence

320
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,980
on threats that are directly affecting

321
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,810
the operation of industrial control

322
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,790
systems here you have something like

323
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,820
trisys trisys was a highly tailored very

324
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,220
specific malware that targeted a safety

325
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,600
instrumented system at an oil and gas

326
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,050
facility in the Middle East it was a

327
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,640
design to directly affect that specific

328
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,160
ICS it was at Schneider under electric

329
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,830
safety instrumented system and that you

330
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,240
were able to sort of customize the

331
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,740
malware to facilitate a potential event

332
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,940
and then you have the indirect ICS

333
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,980
impact so this would be intelligence on

334
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,960
threats that are not associated with

335
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,580
industrial control systems but have a

336
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,230
high likelihood of disrupting their

337
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,270
operation here we're talking about

338
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,700
ransomware would be a great example want

339
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,380
to cry and not petya to very disastrous

340
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,090
ransomware malware incidents and they

341
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,890
did actually impact operations at a

342
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,720
variety of different facilities for

343
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,700
instance not Patea took down the

344
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,170
pharmaceutical company Merck for quite a

345
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,660
while their packaging manufacturing and

346
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,460
formulation operations were disrupted

347
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,380
for weeks

348
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,670
actually recently in the news we've seen

349
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,090
evidence or reporting of some pretty

350
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,860
disruptive incidents they're called

351
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,210
malware events or cyber incident

352
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,440
companies don't ever really want to come

353
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,150
out and say oh we got ransomware and it

354
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,450
totally stopped our production so so

355
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,470
yeah so you've seen though some recent

356
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,820
examples like that the one I have off

357
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,020
the top of my head is a recent

358
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,270
automotive manufacturing company their

359
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,860
IT systems got hit and it's disrupted

360
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,300
their operations so it's pretty

361
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,650
interesting to kind of see that

362
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:03,090
happening with increasingly worrying

363
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,820
regularity it seems um in terms of the

364
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,530
differences so the threat landscape is a

365
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,600
lot different and we're going to talk

366
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,540
about that in just a second ot does have

367
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,640
enterprise technology but a lot of it

368
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,490
does require

369
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,470
Eli's knowledge so just because an

370
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,080
adversary is able to access the

371
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,070
company's operations doesn't mean

372
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,570
they're gonna actually be able to do

373
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,480
anything that's highly targeted an

374
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,160
adversary must maintain access and learn

375
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,720
to different networks with specialized

376
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,160
technology requiring specialized

377
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,959
capabilities again they're probably

378
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,610
gonna get in there through the IT pivot

379
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,100
into the OT and then what do they do so

380
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,570
that means that they're gonna take

381
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,390
awhile to learn how things work every

382
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,240
single oaky facility and network is

383
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,010
going to be different you're never gonna

384
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,290
have it be copy and pasted even if it's

385
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,970
within the same industry for instance

386
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,890
oil and gas it's all gonna be different

387
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,110
in different geographies is gonna be

388
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,330
different the protocols are different so

389
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,100
you have to spend time actually learning

390
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,540
that understanding that reverse

391
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,850
engineering some of the the devices that

392
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,990
you're gonna find before you can

393
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,940
actually do anything that means as

394
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,930
defenders and threat intelligence

395
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,490
practitioners we can provide information

396
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,860
to these guys and say hey look for these

397
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,480
types of TTP's look for these start

398
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,430
behaviors and then you have more time to

399
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,020
be able to identify this potential

400
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,279
threat and kick them out before they can

401
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:19,130
do anything disruptive components if

402
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,420
their intelligence might be the same for

403
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,560
instance you have your indicators of

404
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,360
compromised and threat behaviors a lot

405
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,829
of stuff that we've been talking about

406
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:27,079
all day but the behaviors themselves are

407
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:28,100
gonna be a lot different

408
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,980
so within IT you have you know you're

409
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,660
you're pretty typical using built-in

410
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,040
Windows tools to kind of move around the

411
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,440
network or deploy things whatever but

412
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,990
with an OT it's a lot different so for

413
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,450
instance you might VPN into an HMI where

414
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,450
you set up a new user account download a

415
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,310
file and then try to connect and operate

416
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:50,300
a PLC that is seemingly normal behavior

417
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,450
but perhaps it shouldn't be happening so

418
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,209
that could be an identification of SCADA

419
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:58,850
hijack behavior so um

420
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,680
finally the decision-making calculus is

421
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,970
different and this is really across the

422
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,920
board right so you're gonna be making

423
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,450
different business decisions based on

424
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,399
this again if you think about patching

425
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:09,050
or updating is it's gonna cost my

426
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,610
company millions of dollars if I do this

427
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,690
should I wait until it doesn't in terms

428
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,810
of policy decisions as well that's

429
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,820
something that is that are often made

430
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,410
based off of these sort of big attacks

431
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,540
these in this some sort of national

432
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,949
security or policy things that are going

433
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:28,650
on that plays a role as well so um

434
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,720
whoever is receiving that information

435
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,670
that far intelligence you have to be

436
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,900
able to sort of tailor that and

437
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,340
understand how the decisions are going

438
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,680
to be made off of that and again this

439
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,480
might be totally different if it's the

440
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,490
same company on the IT side versus the

441
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:46,950
OT side so uh talking about the threat

442
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,240
landscape

443
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,160
so as our capabilities and a threat

444
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,260
hunting and identification of ICS focus

445
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,090
threats expand we achieve greater

446
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,830
visibility into the threat landscape and

447
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,690
can create a more holistic picture of

448
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,370
the threats behaviors and tradecraft

449
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,310
affecting ICS environments historically

450
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,050
there's been pretty limited visibility

451
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,850
into OT networks there hasn't been a

452
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,950
whole lot of data collection and

453
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,100
telemetry available for hunting or

454
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,420
identification purposes but we've

455
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,390
actually gained a lot more visibility

456
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:18,570
and so we're able to find more and see

457
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,310
more I do want to kind of put a caveat

458
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,170
though because we're gaining more

459
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,420
visibility we are identifying high large

460
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,490
numbers of adversaries of course but

461
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,270
that doesn't mean that they weren't

462
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,580
there before it just means that maybe we

463
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,490
didn't find them so we anticipate that

464
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,010
as our visibility increases that's

465
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,730
definitely going to change as well so

466
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,800
Drake attracts nine activity groups

467
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,410
targeting ICS ot I don't want to give

468
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,090
you like a total threat briefing right

469
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:48,360
now but we do consider to to be fairly

470
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,640
dangerous and incapable that would be

471
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,380
xenotime that was the activity group

472
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,510
that was behind the trisys malware so

473
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,670
they've showed a lot of interest in

474
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:00,120
being able to create very specific ICS

475
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,740
tailored malware to cause potential

476
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,020
disruption and then you have electrum

477
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,460
this is the activity group that was

478
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,140
responsible for the crash override

479
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,069
malware that was an event back in a 2016

480
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:14,400
that targeted in transmission electric

481
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,829
transmission station in Ukraine they

482
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,690
actually were able to build malware that

483
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,270
specifically targeted switchgear and

484
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,130
circuit breaker to target to toggle them

485
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:23,700
on and off

486
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,859
I mean in the malware they had many

487
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,000
different modules that were very

488
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,270
specific to protocols within that

489
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,130
environment

490
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,690
and again I see a specific malware

491
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,960
because we haven't seen too too much

492
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,180
evidence of this you have crash override

493
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,150
in crisis we get choices happened

494
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,240
2017 so 2018 was a fairly quiet year in

495
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,980
terms of public announcements of this

496
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,080
type of malware but we anticipate that

497
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,590
that is going to increase as folks

498
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,730
increase their capabilities and

499
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,420
investment and then you have a supply

500
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,890
chain and third party access this is a

501
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,480
trend that we're seeing I'm not no t

502
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,850
targeting adversaries one that's pretty

503
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,200
unique is original equipment

504
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,590
manufacturers we have actually seen

505
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,360
xenotime targeting OEMs we haven't

506
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,070
shared a lot of information on this but

507
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,720
it is pretty concerning because original

508
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,980
equipment manufacturers are not

509
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,320
necessarily specific to one industry

510
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,370
within the OT even though obtained

511
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,660
environments are totally different a lot

512
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,000
of them use very similar devices or

513
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,900
mechanisms and if activity group or an

514
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,320
actor is able to compromise an OEM that

515
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,840
could potentially be dangerous for other

516
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,080
for across the industry and then you

517
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,790
have telecommunications this is kind of

518
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,500
an interesting one actually we recently

519
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,780
released a report on hexane this is an

520
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,130
activity group the targets oil and gas

521
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,500
but they also targeted

522
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,080
telecommunications entities why would

523
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,840
that be useful they're interesting well

524
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,860
if you think about a very spread out

525
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,120
facilities you have offshore oil and gas

526
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,090
drilling for instance you have

527
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,740
potentially wind farms that are found

528
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,700
pretty far away right and so you have

529
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,380
these that are monitored and controlled

530
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,890
by mobile or satellite networks so being

531
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,150
able to compromise the

532
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,800
telecommunications infrastructure of

533
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,950
potentially an LTE network then you

534
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,240
might be able to sort of control these

535
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,220
offshore or really spread out thank you

536
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,090
networks and so then you have a remote

537
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,910
access and vendor access we have seen ot

538
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,800
entities targeting remote access portals

539
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,980
and VPN gateways vendor access is

540
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,050
another really good one oftentimes they

541
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,780
might push over-the-air updates they you

542
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,660
know send firmware packages they have

543
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,220
whether that's remotely or they actually

544
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,480
set foot in your environment to actually

545
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,880
update things and get things moving

546
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,700
there is one actually interesting case

547
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,110
that I I think is pretty interesting

548
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,240
nothing actually happened from it

549
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,419
um but last year there was a an electric

550
00:19:56,419 --> 00:19:58,730
utility device manufacturer that shipped

551
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,600
a device with a USB that may have been

552
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,399
infected with malware at a third-party

553
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:07,190
company so they put out this alert and

554
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,649
they're like hey FYI please don't use

555
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:12,740
this USB and although nothing actually

556
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,659
happened from that there wasn't any

557
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:16,520
public reported actual malware

558
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,049
infections that's a very interesting

559
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:20,450
attack vector and has threats that you

560
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,970
might not think of an adversary is able

561
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,360
to sort of hijack the usb manufacturer

562
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,539
of a particular devices information or

563
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:31,070
booklet or whatever the company is

564
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,020
shipping it with that could potentially

565
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,799
cause a lot of problems and then you

566
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,779
have these systemic and input-output

567
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,610
fronts we talked a little bit about that

568
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,039
before but then again you have a lot of

569
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,559
variables that are along a very broad

570
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:48,320
supply chain when it comes to ot I'll

571
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,610
give you a couple examples of what

572
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,890
adversaries might do so if you're

573
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,539
targeting a coal power generation plant

574
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:56,149
you might target the railway system why

575
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:58,220
because the railway system is going to

576
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,870
be transporting the coal to the coal

577
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,730
power generation if they don't get that

578
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,770
coal they're not going to make power so

579
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,419
by targeting the railway station you

580
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:06,950
might not even have to access the OT

581
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,360
networks of the coal power generation

582
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,950
but you're still able to disrupt

583
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,039
operations there another example would

584
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,220
be if you want to potentially impact

585
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,260
electric distribution of transmission in

586
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,940
the west coast of the United States

587
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,130
let's say California you might want to

588
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,510
target the Vancouver natural gas

589
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,029
pipeline knock that down how that go out

590
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:28,250
for about a day or two and then the

591
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,350
residual effects of that are going to be

592
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,750
outages in California or potentially

593
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,970
other places along the west coast so

594
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,740
these are sort of the the systemic and

595
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,210
put output threats that you don't really

596
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:46,309
have an IT there's also this idea of the

597
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:48,590
proliferation of threats this is

598
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,320
something that we obviously saw that was

599
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,330
very similar to nuclear weapons

600
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,330
proliferation that concern there but

601
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,010
frets are also spreading in the cyber

602
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,990
cyber realm as well why is this well

603
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,980
governments are increasingly investing

604
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,169
in offensive cyber capabilities

605
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:07,880
and the ability to disrupt a critical

606
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,130
infrastructure that's not necessarily a

607
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,990
secret either if you follow the news

608
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,510
when it comes to ot stuff pretty closely

609
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,850
you might have recently seen some

610
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,380
countries talking about possessing these

611
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,149
capabilities and potentially doing stuff

612
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:23,360
with them so we're seeing that there

613
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
they want to create these capabilities

614
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,860
across the board it's not just the

615
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,710
people that we think are the bad guys

616
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,240
it's also becoming easier to obtain the

617
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,010
resources and skills necessary for a

618
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,380
destructive cyber physical event even

619
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,929
you have these legitimate penetration

620
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:40,880
testing platforms that are incorporating

621
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,250
ICS SCADA OT specific modules within

622
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,490
them that's great of course for your red

623
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,889
teamers but then you also might have

624
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:50,179
adversaries that are using these

625
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:52,669
publicly available tools to potentially

626
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:55,090
work that into their operations as well

627
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,710
again it's not necessarily super easy to

628
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,149
be able to learn this a lot of it is

629
00:22:59,149 --> 00:23:00,860
very very specialized it takes a long

630
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,360
time to be able to understand and know

631
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,039
this but it is becoming increasingly

632
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:08,240
more available to more people and then I

633
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,679
just wanted to kind of point out an

634
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,210
example of this whole iteration of

635
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,789
threats is at a time again my favorite

636
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:16,909
um they targeted oil and gas initially

637
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:19,700
with trisys but we actually observe them

638
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,070
expanding not shifting but expanding

639
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,330
their interests to include electric

640
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,940
utilities as well so adversaries are not

641
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,880
staying within one industry the scope

642
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,669
can expand across various industries so

643
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:36,980
when it comes to generating ot threat

644
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,169
intelligence so like we've said the OT

645
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,789
threats are a lot different from the

646
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:43,220
enterprise equipment is unique your

647
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,809
high-value assets what you care about is

648
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:47,179
a lot different and a cyber risk that

649
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:48,860
your company is willing to accept will

650
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,159
vary between organizations so hunting

651
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,779
for these threats and producing threat

652
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:55,490
intelligence needs to take all of those

653
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,880
differences into consideration we're

654
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,230
talking about your high-value assets

655
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,850
they're often called the crown jewels

656
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,370
these again they will vary by industry

657
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,590
and even within companies right like an

658
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,269
oil and gas facility in one part of the

659
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:09,380
country you might have totally different

660
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,809
crown jewels and so do the motivations

661
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:14,450
for attacking them so for instance you

662
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,860
have your data historians that contains

663
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,450
a lot of production and process data a

664
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,700
lot of really good insight and

665
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,740
the business so an adversary might

666
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,620
attack that for economic purposes to

667
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,440
further their own business interests if

668
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,560
we're talking about chemical processing

669
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,670
we're talking about chemical processing

670
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,530
you might have an adversary that's

671
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,400
interested in making their own

672
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,470
pharmaceuticals so they might go after

673
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,600
the very the physical controls that are

674
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,390
actually manufacturing the product to

675
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,300
see to steel that IP and then finally

676
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,280
you have safety controls we have

677
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,310
obviously seen adversaries target this

678
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,040
particular control mechanism but doing

679
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,650
so the consequences are really harming

680
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,930
people or harming the environment it

681
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,060
could cause really big catastrophic

682
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,050
disruptions

683
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,970
so now adversary wants to do that that's

684
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,400
what they might target so when you're

685
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,170
developing a hunting hypothesis within

686
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,770
an OT environment excuse me you really

687
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,210
want to understand the adversaries

688
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,040
behavior so let's use the example of

689
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,470
xenotime targeting OMS and the supply

690
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:17,530
chain so your hypothesis might be if I

691
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,060
increase the number of third party

692
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,950
service providers with access to my ot

693
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,960
then this will provide adversaries with

694
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,520
additional avenues of access to my

695
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,680
sensitive processes so this really helps

696
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,900
you get an idea where to start hunting

697
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,550
and generating threat Intel you want to

698
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,780
identify your third party service

699
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,010
provider and vendor relationship

700
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,600
connections as a starting point for

701
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,370
detecting that potentially malicious

702
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:40,480
activity you also want to be able to

703
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,190
develop sufficient data sources and

704
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,840
visibility I mentioned earlier that

705
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,920
there's kind of been a lack of

706
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,840
visibility when it comes to cyber

707
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,550
threats within the OT that's of course

708
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,170
getting better but you want to be able

709
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,240
to do things like potentially deploy

710
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,110
threat detection and response

711
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,890
capabilities within the OT potentially

712
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,930
set up honey pots to be able to identify

713
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,700
adversary activity that's interested in

714
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,640
a particular device that mechanism and

715
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,990
to be able to do that you can gain

716
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,400
additional telemetry and more

717
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,470
information that can give you a starting

718
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,140
point for hunting you want to understand

719
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,970
the audience and be aware of the context

720
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,620
to make the threat intelligence relevant

721
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,300
so who's actually receiving with our

722
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,670
intelligence is it executives is it

723
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,800
folks that are focused on business

724
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,360
interests are they focus on their

725
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,190
strategic interests who's receiving this

726
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,560
threat intelligence because what you

727
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,820
produce in the information that you

728
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,440
share is going to vary based on who's

729
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,720
getting it you also want to understand

730
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,290
the customer

731
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,210
violence and operational requirements to

732
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,610
make useful recommendations

733
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,750
vulnerability scanning can totally break

734
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,120
the OT if your threat intelligence

735
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,950
products as here's a defensive

736
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,210
recommendation scan for this

737
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,430
vulnerability that might take down the

738
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,950
entire plant and point detection does

739
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:51,790
not exist or isn't supported so again

740
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,140
specialized threat detection and

741
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,330
response capabilities will be very

742
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,800
useful here but your sort of typical

743
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,520
endpoint stuff may not work and then oh

744
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,220
she fight intelligence should help IT

745
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,290
understand the threat impact in context

746
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,330
you really want these groups to be able

747
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,920
to work together and collaborate and

748
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,280
understand the threats that way and then

749
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,390
you really also want to understand

750
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,240
outside factors too so this idea of

751
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,520
attacks on ICS entities like oil and gas

752
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,920
or electric utilities but they can be

753
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,200
used to further political economic and

754
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,390
national security goals this is

755
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,800
additionally kind of a little bit of a

756
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,270
differentiator when it comes to ot

757
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,530
nighty threat intelligence - right

758
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,210
you're not really seeing a whole lot of

759
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,280
crime where targeted specifically at ot

760
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,400
the adversaries are generally backed or

761
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,780
motivated by a little bit more of

762
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:46,210
serious motivations there and so when it

763
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,350
comes to operationalizing to my

764
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,910
intelligence I want to kind of take away

765
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,740
these few things from my talk we

766
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,540
definitely covered a lot of ground here

767
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,730
but if we can remember that the goals

768
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,020
for threat intelligence are largely

769
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,880
similar for IT and ot threat

770
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,920
intelligence practitioners we want to

771
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,390
collect the information and distribute

772
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,770
it and be able to provide customers with

773
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,260
the best ways to protect themselves and

774
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,870
prevent threats the attacker

775
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,790
capabilities motivation and attack

776
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,340
surface vary between IT and ot targeting

777
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,620
adversaries although you might have an

778
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,240
OT targeting adversary that gets in

779
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,130
through the IT they're gonna require a

780
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,790
lot of understanding development tool

781
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,910
development and deep understanding of

782
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,650
both the environment as well as whatever

783
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,700
host or device that they're targeting

784
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,410
security decisions within the IT and ot

785
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,760
are going to be made differently

786
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,260
even if it's based on the same

787
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,050
intelligence whether that's whether or

788
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,240
not you want to patch um wait until the

789
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,620
next patching cycle to actually

790
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,090
distribute this patch even if that's

791
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,940
months down the line

792
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,490
versus an IT you might do that overnight

793
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:50,100
I also want to point out here too that

794
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,780
within the ot environments there are a

795
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,160
lot of different requirements and

796
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,840
regulations that govern them for

797
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,730
instance in the United States electric

798
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,920
utilities have very tight regulations

799
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,650
cybersecurity is very important there so

800
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,820
they're going to be making a totally

801
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,990
different decision when it comes to

802
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,990
security patching etc then you might see

803
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,520
with for instance a manufacturing

804
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,730
company and then it takes everyone

805
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,650
working together to make ICS entities

806
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,390
and the communities that they operate in

807
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,210
and support safer and more secure that

808
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,680
includes everybody in this room right

809
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,870
it's really important these systems are

810
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,550
very critical to our way of life whether

811
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,390
that's electric

812
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,280
oil and gas making our cars go keeping

813
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,350
the lights on and it's really cool to be

814
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,850
able to collaborate across the board

815
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,890
regardless of what you specialize in to

816
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,870
be able to make these communities and

817
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:37,110
these networks a lot safer that's what

818
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,090
we have for today I think I yea just

819
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:42,270
literally just hit time perfect um but

820
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,490
if anyone has any questions I will be

821
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,080
hanging out around the rest of the

822
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,520
conference so I'm happy to talk about

823
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,550
anything thank you

824
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:56,399
[Applause]
