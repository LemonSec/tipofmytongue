1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,389
hi everyone welcome I haven't issue with

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,020
my boys so I hope you can understand me

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,970
okay

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,570
so girls botnet discovery of a new

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,690
Android banking Trojan from an object

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,340
ever welcome everyone

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,130
all right so let me introduce who we are

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,930
my name is Anna

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,680
Sharapova I work at a vast as a security

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,800
researcher and I'm also collaborator at

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,230
the approximate project which is a joint

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,579
project between a vast and CTU Czech

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,750
Technical University

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,469
so I'm Sebastian Garcia the director of

15
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,039
the stratosphere laboratory in the Czech

16
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,530
Technical University in Prague

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,949
Maria Hauser Cara is also our coauthors

18
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,210
she's now in Argentina

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,590
she cannot attend right so do the best

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,449
to tell our story today with Samantha so

21
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,459
the discovery what happening here

22
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,490
so ghost is a new partner that we found

23
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,490
while we were infecting another malware

24
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,880
the HD vote malware does anybody know HD

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,420
mode malware no it's not people so HD

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,479
mode is a peroxy malware when you get

27
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,840
infected your computer is part of a

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,220
proxy like illegal proxy Network so the

29
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,030
people gets paid and then you access the

30
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,189
proxy Network and then you go to the

31
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,490
internet okay this is the model of HD

32
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,530
mode however while looking at this we

33
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,320
found all the Luka we found some traffic

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,490
of some users using HD mode that look

35
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,700
very weird so we were hoping to catch

36
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,420
attackers using HD bots and suddenly we

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,820
found some command control operators

38
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,240
using HD mode to go to the internet and

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,129
continue attacking ok so we were we were

40
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,260
looking at the traffic and this is what

41
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,890
we found

42
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,319
right we found this we're pattern of

43
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,390
slash use and that intend to be an

44
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,090
unencrypted I'll look at here visa right

45
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,560
you can see that there is something

46
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,069
going on and this is unique or you can

47
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:31,530
also tell because of the slash you and

48
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,590
it's Russian language and at the end it

49
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,000
was a list of SMS from a big team so

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,120
this is the SMS we found you can take a

51
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,030
look and says Oh withdrawal of funds

52
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:51,120
blood Vox rubles 120 password 32

53
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,310
something something do not disclose the

54
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,489
password to anyone right only fraudsters

55
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:59,220
requires passwords is that well what's

56
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,760
going on here so we start looking and we

57
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,920
found a lot of information coming from

58
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,430
the victims to the command and control

59
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:13,080
operators right and then we saw in real

60
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,530
life how the Covenant control both

61
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,130
masters logged in inside the command

62
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,970
control panel using the HD mode proxy so

63
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,799
they believe they were super secure

64
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,780
super anonymous super hacker and we saw

65
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,510
how they work it inside this web page

66
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,640
and they were requesting the information

67
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,299
right so you can see here the real man

68
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,970
in the middle of the domain you seen the

69
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,920
real password of the command control and

70
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,290
you can see how they were getting a

71
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,140
webpage very important here we only

72
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,590
access the traffic of the malware

73
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,450
getting through our connection

74
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,600
we never get inside any command and

75
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,750
control web page ok all those images are

76
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,060
reconstructed from the network traffic

77
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,590
ok so when we found this we say we need

78
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,480
to dig deeper what's going on here

79
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,010
so we start working in the

80
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,560
infrastructure for the first time we

81
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,988
realize there was no name for this so oh

82
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:23,030
oh there

83
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,850
there was no name for this so we put the

84
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,520
name ghost and we start saying that they

85
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,860
were 14 come on and controls IP

86
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,600
addresses around the world including

87
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,430
eyepiece in us Maori Tanya what's going

88
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,220
on in Mauritania we have no idea they

89
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,230
have all the infrastructure there in

90
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,230
Mauritania under Russia right each

91
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,380
domain up to hundred domains hundred

92
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,480
fifty unique domains in total are

93
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,320
roughly hundred fifty apks so we start

94
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,870
finding what's going on and who is

95
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,500
attacking here right the command and

96
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,230
control panel it's showing in Russian

97
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,510
here I'm not sure if anybody can speak

98
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,960
Russian

99
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,000
we will translator likely so you can see

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,120
the ID of each of the victims you can

101
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,419
see the email of each of the victims you

102
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:21,050
can see the rights the third column is

103
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,660
the rights on the phone and then you

104
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,260
have the version of Android the operator

105
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,330
the phone operator including the phone

106
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,660
number the country and then you have

107
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,620
bank accounts balances so they can

108
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,680
access the exact amount of money that

109
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,700
they have in their bank accounts and

110
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,620
then there is a lot of stuff that we

111
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,310
don't know exactly what it's useful for

112
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,400
example in here you can pick five banks

113
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,180
to inject into the apk so they can

114
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,060
control maybe communicate with five

115
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,360
different banks in Europe and you can

116
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,880
see that there is a favorite balance and

117
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,440
the flow the flow it's an indicator of

118
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,380
which attacker got that phone okay how

119
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,750
did you get in fact that this is the

120
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,810
purpose of the flow by looking at the

121
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,850
code of application you can see more

122
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,760
details about the banks and it was very

123
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,300
important that they were not targeting

124
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,919
50 banks or hundred bucks

125
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:33,680
they were only targeting five banks

126
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,229
including Kiwi that is not really Bank

127
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:36,800
isn't

128
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,940
payment system okay so then we start

129
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,949
having a better picture of the purpose

130
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:46,639
of what Gail's butlet is doing in

131
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,830
particular we found a lot of randomness

132
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,699
and this proved to be very good for them

133
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:55,699
very good they have domains that look

134
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,759
like DJ but they are not they have these

135
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:01,819
PHP files that look completely random

136
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:04,729
they have the TLS certificates in there

137
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:07,250
the common names also completely random

138
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,650
and they have all the activities inside

139
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,129
they became completely random this

140
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:15,650
proved to be very good security measure

141
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,909
to avoid finding new apks if you

142
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:22,849
remember the two talks ago the

143
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:24,949
checkpoint people was talking about how

144
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:26,930
they used a certificate to find new ones

145
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,990
in this case this was not possible okay

146
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,620
you have to dig deeper for this so when

147
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,440
we found all the apks we saw that

148
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,500
actually most anti viruses are already

149
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,560
detecting them most of them are being

150
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,500
detected most of them are actually known

151
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,949
to be bunkers so what's going on here

152
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:52,520
why do we have no super complex exploit

153
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,340
well you have something that is very

154
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,740
impossible to detect does anybody know

155
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,590
why why they are not having a

156
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:04,400
super-duper very difficult to get my

157
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,580
wall why every time you upload an apk

158
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,690
you can detect it very easily

159
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:18,020
No so the answer is they don't care they

160
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,389
don't care right they continue working

161
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:22,550
like this and they are operating very

162
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,310
very very well even if everyone is

163
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,129
detecting right there is no impact in

164
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:31,729
their operation so far so some of the

165
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:35,440
games and players that they're using

166
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,519
applications like emitter follower

167
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,729
installing and are asking SMS MMS phones

168
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:46,070
contacts control the system under window

169
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,130
external storage and of course Internet

170
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,760
okay are they using any exploit no

171
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,180
they're not exactly as in the checkpoint

172
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,140
talk they're using the fact that most of

173
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,930
the big themes that do not have a clear

174
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,110
access to Google Play for example so is

175
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,900
very common to then load application

176
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,400
from web pages this is the key to

177
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,260
infection right this is why this is

178
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:15,740
working

179
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,660
it's not even social engineering so much

180
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,840
it's just hey I need the game I don't

181
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,240
want to pay I will know this one okay

182
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,450
and it works it worked big so big teams

183
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:30,680
we compute an estimation of 800,000

184
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,530
victims this is a huge amount of victims

185
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:37,130
only for you to compare me right started

186
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,800
like two years ago with 800,000 now it's

187
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,040
much bigger the biggest botnets that we

188
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,090
know so far

189
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:48,320
roughly 1 million so we have roughly 1

190
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,740
million big teams in Russia being

191
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,790
attacked and nobody knew for a long time

192
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,120
right so why this happen why why we're

193
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,030
missing these you can see these are

194
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,820
examples of SMS taking from the phones

195
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,490
they're very much into private

196
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,640
information including all your SMS texts

197
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,120
all your contacts all your balances

198
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,330
every withdrawal every purchase you're

199
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,760
doing they know everything that is going

200
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,650
through your phone then mmm

201
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,590
and then we have sort of very unique

202
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,810
situation

203
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,420
thanks to Veronica Valera's she found

204
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:37,120
the chat log basically available online

205
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,980
and this was very interesting because

206
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,670
that was a clear indication of relation

207
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,220
to guess of the attackers who that the

208
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:52,360
one from that chart so the chat walk was

209
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,440
over in Russian it was for a almost a

210
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,210
year long it has

211
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,730
twenty-eight people involved in the

212
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,910
conversations and but I need to say that

213
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,610
not all of them are related to guests

214
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,710
when we started to look at that we

215
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,930
thought that that's like a big group but

216
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,990
then we realized that only one person is

217
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,370
chatting with 28 others and only two of

218
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,710
them - two of them are related to two

219
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,020
guests and I'm going to tell you how we

220
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:31,020
and why so meet our two people who

221
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,710
involved against its power fire and

222
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,540
murex this is the identities that they

223
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,170
used

224
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,720
there are nicknames we believe that

225
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,170
power fire is the one who is knowing the

226
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,470
people with money and the one who know

227
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,020
the Gaels people and keep referring to

228
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,520
them in the chat as they and murex is

229
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,200
just partners so they work together very

230
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,700
closely this is the typical conversation

231
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,560
which is happening between them so they

232
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,790
frequently exchange the links and URLs

233
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:13,910
to ghost botnet panel they are always

234
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,610
talking about hey we install the file

235
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,000
the Kaspersky get clean so they just old

236
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,920
Rhian creep and then stole it again

237
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,620
and all kind of this stuff they also

238
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,350
discuss they have like more common

239
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,240
problems like they have depressed

240
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,880
programmers for example they keep

241
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,280
encouraging them to push and not keep

242
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,860
just a local copy and keep updates and

243
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,870
one of them was like super unmotivated

244
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,320
so they had to just you know keep

245
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,510
telling you hey let's finish the job and

246
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,610
all these kind of things so we realize

247
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,940
that they just basically humans so and

248
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,170
they kind of perceive this as work like

249
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,500
daily job so we were thinking okay so

250
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,420
maybe there is a clear pattern when

251
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,090
they're chatting with each other and as

252
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,550
you can see from this graph that they

253
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,280
mostly engage in conversations at the

254
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,190
evening which we assume maybe that's

255
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,209
because this is

256
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,639
the convenient time between for both of

257
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,829
them like May they might be in different

258
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,059
time zones or maybe in different

259
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:20,339
countries we don't know precisely or

260
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:23,449
maybe they have a regular job and

261
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:25,949
evenings are the best for them because

262
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:28,379
they are not working so they can just do

263
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:32,699
the side projects so the difficulties

264
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:34,949
for me even as a native Russian speaker

265
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:37,949
was to understand what's going on and

266
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:39,509
what they are talking about and writing

267
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:42,959
about and then that was a challenge

268
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,749
first of all they use a lot of slang

269
00:13:45,749 --> 00:13:49,589
they are also misspelling a lot so and

270
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:52,129
they use transliteration when they are

271
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,720
saying for example English words and

272
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,119
typing in in Cyrillic I will give you an

273
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,629
example so here they are talking about

274
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:02,519
some financial operation and they say

275
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,420
hey do they want Belka which is squirrel

276
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,610
translating as a squirrel in English and

277
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,709
I'm like wait a second okay I need to

278
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:12,660
google that and then found out that this

279
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,040
actually referring to the white

280
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,249
accounting the other the other example

281
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:19,709
would be for example the lega which

282
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:22,139
means cart and they are talking hey you

283
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:25,290
can contact me on telega and I was like

284
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,730
what is that and it's apparently a

285
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,549
telegram and there are also lots of

286
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:32,149
shortcuts like TP which refers to

287
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:36,779
customer service or SSH just written in

288
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:40,199
Russian Cyrillic so what there was a

289
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,480
little bit of challenging for me to

290
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,869
understand so they are talking a lot

291
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:48,569
about the payments and as I mentioned

292
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:50,369
before power fire is kind of like the

293
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:53,279
main guy so he knows people with money

294
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,600
and he also paying to his partner and

295
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,189
interesting thing is is they using the

296
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:03,209
web money and kiwi to exchange like

297
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:06,149
transactions which is not very wise

298
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:10,290
because it could be trackable but we

299
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,059
don't we don't know they just probably

300
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:16,499
don't care that much so they avoid other

301
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,740
systems like Yandex pay we are not sure

302
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,019
if maybe because in the countries they

303
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:24,569
were working they couldn't access these

304
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:25,580
other systems

305
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,220
so they have some constraints which easy

306
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,860
stems to use right right and also they

307
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,110
always talking about exchange so we

308
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,240
believe that they receive money are not

309
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,459
in the rubles they have a different

310
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:39,440
currency and then they have to exchange

311
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,870
and then basically to make a transaction

312
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,390
to pay the payment so there have a very

313
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,250
various business models like each of

314
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,970
them the ghost is only one part of that

315
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,320
and this we believe that they engage in

316
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,790
traffic redirections that they build

317
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:04,510
specific websites which are then easy

318
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,250
searchable in the search engines so they

319
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,940
basically using black s SEO like search

320
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,209
engine and optimizations and so the lure

321
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:16,279
users specifically for the keywords of

322
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:18,200
their websites and then they are sell

323
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,320
traffic or redirect users to whatever

324
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,200
they want basically they access they

325
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,850
have access to the credit card

326
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,540
information

327
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,079
the engaging in spam they have lots of

328
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,810
collecting lots of personal data from

329
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,680
the users in particular we found this

330
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,500
some of the apks we're trying to get

331
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,430
into Google Wallet accounts so they are

332
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:47,180
very much having a diversity of services

333
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,270
to gain money and each of them is this

334
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,850
no small amount of the money they get

335
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,399
like they ask you for your account and

336
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:58,100
your car number and all the information

337
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,820
in there is put information in there of

338
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,819
course and they get his information we

339
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:07,280
are not sure how but this is translate

340
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,290
into money maybe they are selling it

341
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,449
maybe they are using it maybe they're

342
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:13,250
feeling it again into the system right

343
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,480
so this is the typical affiliation

344
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,790
marketing representation and we believe

345
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,949
that this is the one of the let's say

346
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:27,319
stream of revenue for them so they

347
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,600
having these sites which are a

348
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,850
particular design to lure users to

349
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,370
download Craig games or watch videos in

350
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,640
mine or etc and so they have a partner

351
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,440
and I must say this is the affiliation

352
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,650
marketing and the legal come like it's

353
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,230
it could be legal it doesn't mean in per

354
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,120
se that this is malicious but it could

355
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,690
be used by anyone and some of them based

356
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,480
in Russia are not very trustworthy so

357
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,880
basically they have their own customers

358
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,710
the customers are coming to the

359
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,290
affiliation marketing and ask them hey

360
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,559
we need users to install to download our

361
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,690
stuff our malware our applications

362
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:09,080
whatever and so partner occur basically

363
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,690
find people like our guys and who

364
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,919
provide them traffic and users and so

365
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,980
part of the system is installing and

366
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,090
configuring those web pages they're

367
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,010
registering domains all the time putting

368
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,530
web pages all the time and redirecting

369
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:33,049
usings users all the time right so the

370
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:35,240
obvious question is how much money they

371
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,480
are making from it from the conversation

372
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,760
and from discussion that they said and

373
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,500
they mentioned the price of the one

374
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,809
installation and the price of one

375
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:46,580
installation is 20 rubles which is

376
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:53,720
roughly 0.3 USD this is like to give you

377
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,669
an estimate it's for five for 250

378
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:00,590
installation you will get like five

379
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,450
thousands which is roughly $77 and for

380
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:08,540
one thousand of installations you will

381
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,440
get like 20 thousand installation is one

382
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,010
user getting into the system right so

383
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:18,440
this is a small amount but they have a

384
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,500
lot of users birthday moving here

385
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,910
so actually the money is very good right

386
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,880
so this is the common process so like

387
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,330
the workflow of those two guys so power

388
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,490
fire is always asking Merrick's - hey

389
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,559
and you please install the file and he

390
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,950
telling the name of the file and me ryx

391
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,140
is installing it but we don't know what

392
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,140
there is no downloading in the happening

393
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,610
on the background so we didn't know

394
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,410
what's happening so apparently they

395
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,419
might know the place where they keep

396
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:51,410
these files

397
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,110
they have a both access - maybe this is

398
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,540
a Google Drive or some other storage

399
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,780
like it and we don't know and then we

400
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,320
usually get after the lyrics reports yes

401
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,660
I will install then she reports back yes

402
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,150
and the installation is like happened

403
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,460
everything is fine and then in a few

404
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,130
minutes you can see that the statistics

405
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,610
and gears appeared and is always passed

406
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,690
in the chat we estimated that they're

407
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,970
uploading a new apk every two days

408
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,300
roughly two or three days right so they

409
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,000
know that different anti viruses are

410
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,530
detecting them so the amount of people

411
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,570
is decreasing in time so they're

412
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,240
renewing the apks renewing the domains

413
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,400
renew there were pages I need to going

414
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,130
up again right right so as you can see

415
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,480
there was a lot of mistake in here and

416
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,940
those thanks to those we are here today

417
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,710
and we weren't able to do you pinpoint

418
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,830
some of the object errors did anybody

419
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:10,880
say oh that was actually very valid yeah

420
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:18,200
right no encryption very nice so using

421
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,550
HD what was a mistake why not use in

422
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,070
another network they believe that HD

423
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:29,030
thought was super underground anonymous

424
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:33,320
whatever what it's not right as someone

425
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,010
said already no encryption they the

426
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,800
whole communication was an HTTP and

427
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,780
clear attacks passing back and forth

428
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,620
passwords not deleting cookies login

429
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,680
with the same cookies all the time so so

430
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,910
in several moments they hire developers

431
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,700
for making their web pages and those

432
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,420
developers leaked a lot of information

433
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,000
we are not sure if the developers knew

434
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,400
what they were doing or doing just web

435
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,240
pages

436
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,940
that they look very nice so they were

437
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,130
leaking information all over the

438
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,409
internet about what they were doing how

439
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:14,179
they were doing it and stuff like that

440
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:18,649
that was very bad we stay there also the

441
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:21,409
chat log we don't know how that was

442
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:24,549
leaked and but it's clearly that

443
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:27,470
trusting some people to develop the

444
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,289
stuff for you and then you know all

445
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:33,169
communication is there so and some of us

446
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:35,830
I can just you know read it and track it

447
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,899
if anyone here is the one that leaked

448
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:44,179
the chat log you can you can tell us yes

449
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:46,130
they use no encryption obviously in the

450
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,710
chat for me they didn't use any for

451
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,539
example like signal or like anything

452
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:54,470
they use Skype yeah so here here you go

453
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,020
and the also interesting thing is that

454
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,260
they used the same nickname would say

455
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,630
everywhere over the Internet they they

456
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,820
register them forums to be the same

457
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,230
nickname they use the same nickname in

458
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,299
the chat log and their telegram accounts

459
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:11,299
and etc under so in the chat logs

460
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:14,090
sometimes you can see their real names

461
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:17,390
because in Skype when you quote somebody

462
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,659
then Skype is putting the real username

463
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:23,779
so they are using these weird nicknames

464
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,870
and then you see some name traveling as

465
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,299
whoa what's going on here right so that

466
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:32,600
was very bad for them all right and so

467
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,970
some conclusions are here well as you

468
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,279
can see AB Street is very hard to

469
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,860
maintain and not only for those

470
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,179
attackers but even for apts and anyone

471
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:46,970
actually and big companies as well so a

472
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,029
very small mistake like use energy

473
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:53,149
devote and there was to access the

474
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:56,450
majority of the operation that was the

475
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,169
impact of one mistake and then it just

476
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:02,690
escalated very quickly right small

477
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,820
mistakes give us a lot of information

478
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,159
right Sherlock is a very unique

479
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:09,679
opportunity for us to study the inside

480
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,179
of the operation and the underground

481
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:15,350
organization basically how they work how

482
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,869
they operates what this challenge is for

483
00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:22,139
who they are for how long and etc this

484
00:24:22,139 --> 00:24:23,849
is a unique opportunity basically for us

485
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:26,609
to look at the insights and how that

486
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:28,799
works and what they do and what they're

487
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,369
talking about finally where are we going

488
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:35,899
with this sorry

489
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:38,729
there are similar ways to go we are

490
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,799
gonna go more into the social analysis

491
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,820
because as Anna said the chat log really

492
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,340
gives us insight in the everyday

493
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,609
operation how is for them to work doing

494
00:24:50,609 --> 00:24:53,099
these the the motivational issues

495
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:55,200
several times they were saying hey I

496
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,869
want out I want out this is too much for

497
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:00,269
me and the other guys were no no no

498
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:01,799
