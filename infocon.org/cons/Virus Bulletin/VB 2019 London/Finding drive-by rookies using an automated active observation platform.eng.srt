1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,179
our first presenters are Rintaro and

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,100
Yosuke who is going to be who are going

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,899
to be presenting on finding drive by

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,580
rookies using an automated active

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,710
observation platform so please join me

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,219
in welcoming them thank you

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,960
is that our presentation first

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,910
introduction I'm winter quickie a sweet

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,060
researcher in TT security Japan and

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,359
founder of gnostic I always analyze

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,260
matches topic to clean file or script

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,899
file especially dry battle attacks

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:46,200
och Bochy I'm a Japanese secretary

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,039
research asari security researchers and

15
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,530
head of my own companies

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,090
so my companies provide tactical hybrid

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,550
intelligence services focused on

18
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,690
drive-by download and consulting and

19
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:07,229
tests and hands-on training of all cyber

20
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,189
Security's so and in Nasik I'm a

21
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,330
researcher and operator this automated

22
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:29,909
systems now seek a security team we

23
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,369
independent nonprofit team and not

24
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,090
company so far we have reported many

25
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,700
research with that most of Muslim team

26
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,829
related to drive other contacts for

27
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,759
example we discovered new exploit kit

28
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:51,600
forward and Russia exploit kit today we

29
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,799
talk about how we how do we research

30
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,329
drebbel attacks all right let's take

31
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,649
route cuts recent trip Aeronautics

32
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,020
what do you think about the drive under

33
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,969
attack

34
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:11,410
down here not mainstream that too

35
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,500
compared to when Angra and nuclear alert

36
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,970
yep it's now a down fear not nice sweet

37
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,790
but drive on a tripod and attacks is

38
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,470
kill netic phrase surprisingly six new

39
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,129
exploit kit how they observed over the

40
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:34,390
past unit past year for example

41
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,830
Underminer was reported in try 2018 for

42
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,610
Mario bytes disk it consists of very

43
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,180
complex called and is difficult to

44
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,319
analyze and for out is pretty popular

45
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:56,120
exploit get country it's used for so

46
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,140
many attack campaigns forward was

47
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,959
discovered by me besides said that

48
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,420
speedy ball as retriever Lazio wrote

49
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,319
exploit get discovered over the past

50
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,900
year of this forward and ratio of first

51
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:24,260
discovered and reported by us in

52
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,230
addition to new discoveries we are

53
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,260
consciously observing exploit kids and

54
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,489
attack campaigns we always treat some of

55
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:38,419
the desert these observations are

56
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:43,790
roughly automated there are many

57
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,200
benefits to automation first it's easy

58
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,109
is it's very tiring for research

59
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:53,540
researchers to make minor of the

60
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,829
patients by automating observations can

61
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:03,099
be made as a 24 hour a day in alice-chan

62
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:06,260
other campaigns have a very short

63
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,169
lifespan

64
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:14,650
you may miss it by hand by preparing

65
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,839
multiple different environments

66
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,440
in automation automated system you can

67
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,560
research more comprehensively the manual

68
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,440
for these reasons we propose to automate

69
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,950
the search of Drebin attacks we want to

70
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,150
automate of the patient and analysis and

71
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:43,190
get richer information let's dive in to

72
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:50,620
our of the patient phone today so

73
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,120
observation platform is over here many

74
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,300
components depend on non sectors

75
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,780
so today's mainly focused the the

76
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,640
private component in our system first I

77
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,460
briefly the core of the automation

78
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,090
systems

79
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,980
I exist exist IP anonymizer

80
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,960
this component is a private project and

81
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,690
I will shows some jarppi

82
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:27,669
amber content so first off so this is a

83
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:31,690
problem definitions or our system design

84
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:37,180
first ek and Mario distribution

85
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,669
infrastructures the bang specific IP

86
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:44,200
addresses and range so for example

87
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,360
turned micro IP ranges semantic

88
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,400
appearances and public IP ranges like

89
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,560
AWS manager and Google computing

90
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,430
platforms is banned by League e K so we

91
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:07,700
extracted it is called each time so I

92
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,860
found we found it and also up

93
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,570
advertising network and web color so it

94
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,720
the simple calling accesses as much as

95
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,150
activity to advertising network so

96
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,819
malicious quick up click click out

97
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:36,469
and the Sunwell so we need exist IP

98
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:40,249
addresses more and more popular

99
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:43,360
solutions are the brilliant services but

100
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,379
pepino services is a more not enough to

101
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,259
use our challenges and we also consider

102
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:56,719
the repair services at atoms next beta

103
00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:01,029
solutions is VP and gate VPN gate

104
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:04,849
compiled soft ELISA and University of

105
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:08,899
Tsukuba there in Japanese company and

106
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:13,399
University this solution is a pretty

107
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:18,319
good but we tried to integrate our

108
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,020
system but unstable its TLS Corrections

109
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:31,240
and not enough to use exit IP so ok

110
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,199
about our network crawling and analysis

111
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,689
paper independent now SEC source

112
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:44,659
software tools the soft Stassi and ek

113
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:50,919
total / winter he will talk about them

114
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:56,569
asta C is developed family is a simple

115
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:59,779
interactive front honeypot system if you

116
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,800
input URL Stassi access URL and

117
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,089
corrected for example pickup or sulfur

118
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:12,969
or screenshot and temperature profiles

119
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:17,120
next also each atutor is developed by me

120
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,689
iki total is automatic EK traffic

121
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:24,529
analyzer it can identify much as traffic

122
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:27,559
extract important information and my

123
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:32,479
ways this system uses a key field you

124
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,568
can filters rules for identification

125
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:38,630
you can filter is filter extension

126
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,700
developed by german zebra

127
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,470
recently I added a new feature to Akita

128
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,890
racing a test mission do you know gate

129
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:55,390
gate is URL also always read to ek if

130
00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:00,630
you meet certain conditions most country

131
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,320
driver general tax market I think in the

132
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,310
case of marketizing attacked us were

133
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:14,620
chained changes just K in other words is

134
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,320
very difficult to reproduce attack

135
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,450
traffic so we always identify gate we

136
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,450
the produced topic from gate et total

137
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,920
can estimate the gate to help identify

138
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,860
attack campaigns and repair attack

139
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:42,279
traffic so and the next component may

140
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:46,089
identify as takenoko scanner technical

141
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:49,060
scanner developed by Soto Nakajima and

142
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,649
get a number at know SEC so these

143
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:58,600
interests but black hat you passed all

144
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,209
sorry last year Arsenal's

145
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:05,350
so this tool is a first Mary Agnes fire

146
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,240
so so in the extracted undefined the

147
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,269
binary by ek total so generated

148
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:18,640
extracted binaries through this

149
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,000
component so so this if you want to know

150
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,940
about this - it's also pretty github

151
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:35,230
project so okay so now sectors is a

152
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,940
suitable for expert kit observation wink

153
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,620
but component is a private so if you

154
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,920
want to build same our observation

155
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,319
systems you make it your own

156
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,080
so finally we discovered many experts

157
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,790
get over a year so our channel is all

158
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,660
over by detected a key notification so

159
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:11,620
be good and under minor and fall out so

160
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:18,670
but we continuously try and error or

161
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,460
stable observation so many progress has

162
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,360
occurred so I picked up interstate tips

163
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,450
for researcher and unsolicited purpose

164
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:38,810
first sandbox detection by display

165
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:44,330
resolution so this this sandbox is

166
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,080
equipped with a fallout

167
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:54,140
so in Fallout landing page be a maybe a

168
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,500
Santos detection code is inserted into

169
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,880
the J's code

170
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:05,620
so this check in the list region so but

171
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,310
so in in this case so connected the

172
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:16,520
display and we debating so this parasite

173
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:22,150
is a very very small it's we our systems

174
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:32,180
heated this sandbox and this case is the

175
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,260
fallout again

176
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,380
so in Fallout she'll cost so included

177
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,040
hashed process name measured the other

178
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,620
sisters in short which which was the

179
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:52,360
Wireshark and a filter so and

180
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:57,839
it's a very important things selection

181
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,680
seed of clothing the system's the tape

182
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,629
labeled it URL from its total path day

183
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:14,610
and so applied the lintels experiments

184
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,300
the podcast is open in this to

185
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,310
marketizing so please regard this sample

186
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:34,110
so for cash this first line is a seed

187
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:40,649
URL and we our system close this urls

188
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:47,660
and so next sorry had english rate is a

189
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,860
seven-point 87 percent and the time

190
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:58,439
range is over half a year so and this

191
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:03,449
year is many many exploit get grand soft

192
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:09,300
and minor for out and live so the second

193
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:21,199
one the totally almost same okay and so

194
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,639
this is so important things again so

195
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,680
past this sensor or clothing so if you

196
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,790
want to search expert kid so how many

197
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:40,589
times did you crawling one URL so we

198
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:44,910
apply the quickest experience again our

199
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:51,509
system crawl 11 times in our pal one URL

200
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:56,699
so interval is a five minute and change

201
00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:01,680
IP adresses at our by IP address

202
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,189
randomizer

203
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:12,209
so please look at this and 7377

204
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:18,268
engagement is a bill over three times

205
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:26,410
but for out and leave is not enough to

206
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,540
three times including statistics

207
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:38,889
statistics shows that okay so next I

208
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:43,149
wish all landscape of export kit based

209
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:50,649
on observation system so the first so I

210
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,369
showed chloride chlorine start our

211
00:15:54,369 --> 00:16:03,959
system cost 150 gigabyte in year over

212
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:10,259
90,000 clothes and the engagement

213
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:13,230
exchange she's here

214
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:19,019
the English mate ratio of our system is

215
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:27,489
6.2 percent and so engagement details

216
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:34,989
here okay and grand soft and under minor

217
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:41,169
is measure in our systems consult is the

218
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:46,499
lesion specific campaign like adjudicate

219
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:50,769
so grand soft is a target mainly target

220
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:59,589
is a Japan and Canada only so so this

221
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:02,379
our observation result is a depend on

222
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:03,339
location

223
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:07,799
so our is IP randomized randomizer user

224
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:12,480
only Japanese ISPs

225
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:22,000
and so I started so many some expected

226
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,030
result so this figure shows only under

227
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,170
minor and grand soft so it's clear

228
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:35,840
contrast if increased under minor the

229
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,970
decreased consort

230
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,900
so it's a very clear high contrast so do

231
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:50,680
you think and lady instrument less than

232
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,460
another ek so but we observe the

233
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:01,460
constantly so also blip ek payload have

234
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,440
more abilities animal species observed

235
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:18,040
from BBK and last hole out is a Valu key

236
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,150
extricate so in now we just many for

237
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,710
Audi case payload

238
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:36,659
okay here's some examples how what we

239
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:40,289
observed trying these charities a first

240
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:43,889
chute gate should gate is discovered by

241
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:47,460
us to deities at the campaign observed

242
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,450
in Japan and Canada it's using a gate

243
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,679
that looks like wisdom eight website if

244
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,610
you access gate using Internet Explorer

245
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:03,269
you will be redirected to the grants of

246
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:07,289
the exploited should get involves the

247
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:12,629
most active campaigns in Japan annexed

248
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:16,080
new exploit kits we discovered to

249
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,269
exploit kits for out and ratio we found

250
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:23,970
forward while working our automation

251
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,419
system why did we find it it's very

252
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:28,200
simple

253
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,799
forward included our name in to me he

254
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:38,039
wanted to wanted us to discover since

255
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,759
then we have observed also measure

256
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,470
updates or forward next Raziel export

257
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,429
kit ratio is not very famous but it

258
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:57,259
exploits as we 2016 zero one eight nine

259
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:01,139
it's a very odd turn ability now we

260
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:10,489
found it with 320 6008 nine signature

261
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:15,359
our system also automatically extract

262
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,919
malware from traffic today we have also

263
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,460
discovered several new version or more

264
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:30,720
waves such as crack encrypted or get

265
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,510
clipped from somewhere our system also

266
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:42,850
weakness first it can't do a decade

267
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,380
processing for example in waves

268
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,850
attackers settings inadequate and that

269
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,980
campaign I expected a weakness is evade

270
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,220
it will be difficult for our system to

271
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:05,470
not notice it a finding and new lies not

272
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,940
easy there are many things that country

273
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,529
found that fun with existing signatures

274
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:17,799
in that case especially to combine

275
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:22,389
various methods now for example this any

276
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:26,380
suspicious fires in attempt to tree what

277
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:31,710
did I eat rushed and find the

278
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,370
observation environment for example

279
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,250
there are other campaigns that don't

280
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:44,830
attack our s assist from address in a

281
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,460
specific country vision specific that

282
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,200
campaign you have to adjust consultation

283
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,679
environment according to what you want

284
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:04,090
to observe already we have cooperated in

285
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,179
the search of many companies and in

286
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:11,730
Japan we are also cooperating in

287
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,789
creating date set for academic research

288
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:18,730
our automation system has generated many

289
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:26,789
contributions conclusion

290
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,120
finally we introduced design like

291
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,210
effectiveness and practical use case of

292
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,260
our automated after a necessity system

293
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:42,250
we chose chances which shows the changes

294
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:46,650
to the threat landscape using

295
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:50,309
results from our platform we talked

296
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:55,520
about how we continue to discover and

297
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,100
track new attack campaigns and exploit

298
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,809
get such as for out and Rossi exploit

299
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:06,059
kit ok

300
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,940
that's all thank you for listening when

301
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:15,890
questions please ask throw it on simply
