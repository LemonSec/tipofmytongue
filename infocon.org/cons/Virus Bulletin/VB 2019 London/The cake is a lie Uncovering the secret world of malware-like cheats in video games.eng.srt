10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,700
you will only see some pretty images but

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,290
you will have to listen to me i'm very

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,780
sorry

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,020
so do you know anything about this

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,820
picture who this man is

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,940
this is a very controversial picture to

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,480
show in england anyone knows who i you

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,750
can shout it cheating yeah

18
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,059
thus the over mondo Maradona an

19
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,309
argentinian this game was for the

20
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:05,939
quarterfinals in the 1986 World Cup he

21
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,799
scored a goal against England and

22
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,180
Argentina one two to one

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,189
he scored a goal with his hand so

24
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,590
basically he just slam dunked the ball

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,530
it's not like he touched it or no no it

26
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,979
was pretty obvious so when the yes

27
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,780
asked him like wow how was the goal wood

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,689
was it yourself and he said well half of

29
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,150
the goal was do Maradona half of the

30
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,990
goal was the hand of God and since then

31
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,869
people are calling this moment the hand

32
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,070
of God so for me this is one of the very

33
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,000
first I would say popular cheating

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,369
examples in sports you could see

35
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,049
cheating since the old time since a

36
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,659
great Byzantine Empire but this for me

37
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,360
I'm being here in England I just wanted

38
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,149
like to share this with you so this man

39
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,320
is not so popular his name is Ted Rogers

40
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,610
so he has the most amount of Records

41
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,360
Guinness records

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,780
for video gaming so he has for example a

43
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,180
record in a game called rock star that

44
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,780
he finished for example a lap in six

45
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,960
seconds years of the war another guy

46
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,660
reverse engineered the game and you know

47
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,090
told Activision the publisher like hey

48
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,150
did you guys check this like I was

49
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,070
checking the code and the maximum lab

50
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,080
like the least amount you can do is 5

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,970
seconds like how I mean he hid unless

52
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,630
he's done more sorry so you know they

53
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,300
removed all his records

54
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,070
afterwards all the other companies that

55
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,140
he have records with started checking

56
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,350
and for example he had a record where

57
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,830
game that your score would go in even

58
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,020
numbers and he got the high score in an

59
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,430
uneven number so this is one of the very

60
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,860
first cases of cheating related to video

61
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,610
gaming but why speak about video games

62
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,440
and cheating in a security conference

63
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,230
you might say I've gone crazy I have

64
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,970
nothing else to talk about and you had

65
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,660
nothing better to do maybe but you need

66
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,220
to wait for a couple slides and you will

67
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:30,519
decide at the end so the cake is a lie

68
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,620
I will splain this at the very end but

69
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,800
what I want you to take from this

70
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,500
presentation is that cheating in

71
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,410
videogames is no longer like an action

72
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,180
for single individuals it's an entire

73
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,570
industry and we security professionals

74
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,180
are more than equipped to deal with this

75
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,959
much better than security than

76
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,519
publishers and developers in video game

77
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:56,970
houses

78
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:03,380
I always love to say this quote when I'm

79
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,000
speaking about video games because I

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,010
think it represents exactly how much

81
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,960
influence do they have in our popular

82
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,500
culture

83
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,020
so if pedo games have any influence on

84
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,030
us we'll be in dark rooms munching pills

85
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,329
and listening to read repetitive music

86
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:20,839
so yeah nothing too similar they used to

87
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,960
say that this quote was set by the

88
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,100
Nintendo present but actually was a

89
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,650
British comedian so we thought in the

90
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,110
last slide you know that image in the

91
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,000
background was an eSports tournament

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,330
dota 2 descent of the agent - last year

93
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,910
the number of viewers for that game for

94
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,070
that tournament was 400 million viewers

95
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,930
it was much more by you know a couple of

96
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,500
millions than the Super Bowl the prices

97
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,480
for these tournaments can range from 10

98
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,220
million dollars to 30 million dollars

99
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,850
and when you measure the size of the

100
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,160
gaming industry for example it's it's

101
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,750
more than television than Hollywood and

102
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,990
music so for example let's take just one

103
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,900
one very specific example Grand Theft

104
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,050
Auto 5 did more money in this first

105
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,600
three days of publishing than Adventures

106
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,340
and Star Wars so that's how big this

107
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,710
industry is let's start speaking about

108
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,020
cheating this is one of the very first

109
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,420
documented cheats this is from the year

110
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,170
1996 a Japanese developer thought like

111
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,150
well this is taking too much time to

112
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,730
debug I will probably need some time of

113
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,280
code or something to enable like debug

114
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,040
mode so he went to this code known as

115
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,150
the Konami code or the contra code and

116
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,940
it has been everywhere since then in a

117
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,220
lot of videogames I was one of the very

118
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,870
first codes that you could use

119
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,390
personally I mean just in single player

120
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,250
games just to cheat you know to get

121
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,650
unlimited lives to go to another level

122
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,460
different things

123
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,600
right come on Mission Control but we

124
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,680
could help get the shuttle out of orbit

125
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,110
it can't be that hard okay okay try this

126
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,450
hip up up down down left right left

127
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,460
right B a start then we'll have

128
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,300
unlimited lives

129
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:27,390
I love Family Guy but beyond that this

130
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,010
is a very clear example that sometimes

131
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,850
be against go beyond like you know the

132
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,430
traditional opinion that is just for men

133
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,570
in you know like 20 year olds actually

134
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,030
according to statistics from the

135
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,340
electronic software Alliance in the u.s.

136
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,250
the H the average age for a billion

137
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,550
players 35 years old and 55 percent of

138
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,250
them are male and 45% are female so

139
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,870
people in their 30s are playing video

140
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,180
games people that are having their jobs

141
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,370
and their family and have money to spend

142
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:11,570
on things so I told you that I think

143
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,370
actually is more than thing I know that

144
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,800
this is an industry and this goes back

145
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,540
to 2011 so this is cheat that was made

146
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,390
for World of Warcraft at the time that

147
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,600
game had 12 million players if you

148
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,240
compare it for example with for tonight

149
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,210
nowadays that has more than one 100

150
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,490
million players you'd say like it's it's

151
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:41,310
nothing yet they sold 100,000 copies of

152
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,370
a cheat for $25 so you have a 2.5

153
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,640
million business idea were there of

154
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,150
course they got sued by you know the

155
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,010
publisher by 6 million so he lost

156
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,830
everything and then some but yeah but

157
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,250
still you know it's a clear example that

158
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:04,050
crime does pay even if for a while this

159
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,940
is another example from a game called

160
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,410
APB the publishers were so annoyed with

161
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,480
cheaters that they'd publish an open

162
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,730
letter called should we give cheaters

163
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,910
amnesty and this was because they were

164
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,130
ruining not only the experience for our

165
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,950
players they were ruining the business

166
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,670
nowadays when you

167
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,170
buying a videogame I don't know about

168
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,000
you if you play if you like it or not

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,700
but if you are buying a game the online

170
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,130
experience is one of the most important

171
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,559
factors that you you know it when you

172
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,659
make a decision you say hey can I use it

173
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,270
online because you get poor pretty

174
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,110
easily that's how our focus has shifted

175
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,740
so they they polish these numbers and it

176
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,240
was also around 2011 and they said like

177
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,570
the DS cheat developers are making like

178
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,970
fifteen thousand to fifty thousand

179
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,700
dollars a month and they are ruining the

180
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,160
experience for everyone so what should

181
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,000
we do about it

182
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,190
to give you some examples of how these

183
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,770
cheating pages look like for example

184
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,750
this is diamond cheats and you can have

185
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,410
a subscription model so for example you

186
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,960
pay let's say fifty nine dollars for a

187
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,480
triple a game that's the average price

188
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,580
you know you're paying fifty four

189
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,270
dollars a month to cheat so what's wrong

190
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,900
with you but you know when you read and

191
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,390
this goes beyond the technical side when

192
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,130
you really why people cheat well in some

193
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,110
cases they use it in tournaments do you

194
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,320
see to make money but I have spoken you

195
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,300
know with many people related to the

196
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,790
human sciences and you know the very

197
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,950
first reason for people cheating is that

198
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,760
they hate their jobs there was an

199
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,380
example of a Canadian man that would go

200
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,430
online and you know get even with

201
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,960
everyone in the virtual world so you

202
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,420
would pay let's say forty four five

203
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,490
dollars but in some cases these cheats

204
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,620
could go for five hundred dollars it can

205
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,780
cause several several times more than

206
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,970
the video game I don't know if you can

207
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,360
see the price here but it says for seven

208
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,360
days that's twenty francs and if you

209
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,300
have a lifetime subscription you can

210
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,050
have for two hundred and twenty francs

211
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:34,260
that service you can have valve

212
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,630
anti-cheat pump Buster firefight much

213
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,660
making you can use

214
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,250
in tournaments II will cook for you

215
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,380
we'll do everything but what about

216
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,010
consoles so we have these cheats for PC

217
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,620
master-race but what about consoles so

218
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,830
right now what people are using is

219
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,840
Hardware modifications sometimes using

220
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,700
Arduino Hardware and scripts to automate

221
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,840
everything that they need to do within a

222
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,250
game for example games like League of

223
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,010
Legends or dota 2 where you need to

224
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,740
perform better repetitive actions games

225
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,650
like those in consoles are very easy to

226
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,490
script this is an example from Brazil

227
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,480
that you can buy this USB adapter you

228
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,790
plug it in between your controller and

229
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,850
the console and then you charge and then

230
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,100
you load the script with just your

231
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,050
computer and you can play for example

232
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,230
Battlefield Call of Duty anything like

233
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,360
that and you can cheat without anyone

234
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,090
knowing does anyone know who that man in

235
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:47,430
the background is that's Lord gaben

236
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:52,690
he's the owner of Balby software and you

237
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,670
know as there are cheaters there are

238
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,640
anti-cheating solutions and one of the

239
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,500
problems that we're having right now is

240
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,960
that anti-cheating solutions are having

241
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,270
the same issues as the antivirus

242
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,790
industry it's an arms race between two

243
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,890
opposing sides and at the very same time

244
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,950
there is another player in the middle

245
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,620
that is privacy so if you need to scan

246
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,000
the memory of of the computer if you

247
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,400
need to know what processes are being

248
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,800
used if you need to know everything

249
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,470
about the network connections cookies

250
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,720
whatever there is a privacy issue right

251
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,720
there and people did some reverse

252
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,300
engineering on the bulb anti cheating

253
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,260
software and they found out it was

254
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,970
getting DNS requests for every page that

255
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,890
you did so that's why gaben Gabe Newell

256
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,200
say it like we are not interested in

257
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,110
your porn surfing habits we just want

258
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,580
you not to cheat

259
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,880
and then the FF stopped paying more

260
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,130
attention because other anti-cheating

261
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,269
solutions showed some behaviors like

262
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:03,850
this so in order to protect the player

263
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,670
you need to know what is happening on

264
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,310
the players computer because one of the

265
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,829
very first rule about cheating at least

266
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:14,680
when it comes to computer games is that

267
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,060
the client has too much trust what I

268
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,100
mean by that when you install a game in

269
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,940
your computer

270
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,010
it's your environment you can do

271
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,839
whatever you want so you can load for

272
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,180
example all the debugger either Pro you

273
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,910
can use anything you want to cheat so in

274
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,380
the old days for example if you wanted

275
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,950
to cheat in a first-person shooter and

276
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,019
you had like a LAN party you could use

277
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:40,180
one of the computers as a proxy and for

278
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,279
example if it was a shooting game you

279
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,890
will shoot that instruction would go to

280
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,690
a proxy the proxy will know where the

281
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,029
opponent's the opposing players were

282
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,310
we'll change the instruction and you

283
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,440
will have an instant kill without even

284
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,110
looking at the player so for example you

285
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,520
could shoot right ahead I will kill him

286
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,380
so that's very crazy nowadays is much

287
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,459
more complex than that

288
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:11,350
and it's as the same stories repeating

289
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,930
over and over again as antivirus we've

290
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,360
dealt with this before but now it's the

291
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,470
anti-cheating issue so people are

292
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,500
quitting the games because of all the

293
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,779
cheating and all you know the negative

294
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:27,670
toxic behavior that is around there is a

295
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,640
term core you refer refer people that

296
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,880
just join online games to I know the

297
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,040
hell out of you that's all they do

298
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:44,380
it's like digital prankster so the last

299
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,130
few years

300
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,190
valve has been starting banning players

301
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,470
for doing this they have different

302
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,829
methods for bunny for example in the in

303
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:55,180
the beginning they will ban you for five

304
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,430
minutes then for a day then for a year

305
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,820
and now it's a permanent hardware ban so

306
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,589
if you want to cheat again you need to

307
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:05,350
get another account buy the game again

308
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,160
and cheat another time and people are

309
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:15,250
still doing it the cheats that are used

310
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,040
for these sometimes are you know

311
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,010
detected but there is what is called a

312
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,090
delayed bun

313
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,100
so you don't want the players to know

314
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,130
that you know about the cheat so the

315
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,590
same as the a B industry and creating

316
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,200
records to detect but not publish

317
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,410
anything yet the anti-cheating solutions

318
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,540
are doing the same so I see like

319
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,270
equivalent there you know and that's

320
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,040
what I think that we are more than

321
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,490
equipped to deal with this for example

322
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,230
this there is another game called pop G

323
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,050
that just recently burned 30 million

324
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,540
players so that's how big the issue is

325
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,050
imagine how much money this is costing

326
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:07,020
the companies so for example in in Korea

327
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,910
no I mean South Korea right now

328
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:17,560
cheating is illegal so not only creating

329
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,400
or selling distributing cheats but also

330
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,200
if you are just like a regular streaming

331
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,120
and you are showing modifications of the

332
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,150
game and you are just streaming you know

333
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,770
wanted to build your audience you would

334
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:33,340
get fined or prosecuted for this the

335
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:38,290
worst cases of 40 year 40 yeah 14 year

336
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,980
old boy that was sued by Epic Games

337
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,220
because he was using a modification and

338
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,910
was streaming and you know he's not his

339
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,460
mother from the hood in a very hard way

340
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,530
that they were being sued for millions

341
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,560
and he wasn't even developing these

342
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,720
cheats he was only using them so that's

343
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,830
how far this program has gone but coming

344
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,990
back to Korea it's illegal to cheat in

345
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,030
video games but you know it's legal to

346
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,949
cheat on your wife or your husband so

347
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:10,839
that for me was very interesting when I

348
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,000
was using these keywords just for

349
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,420
searching

350
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:19,040
the memories the methods for cheating

351
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,500
and Ferranti cheating are pretty much

352
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,180
the same that we are seeing between the

353
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,060
malware and the a/b industry so for

354
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,220
example if you were to launch a game and

355
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,510
you were using cheats B I see that's the

356
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,460
anti-cheating solution for bulb would it

357
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,410
take if you have for example sandbox C

358
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,190
were shark always bother any of the of

359
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,860
the tools that we regularly use so it

360
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,390
would get detected and you wouldn't be

361
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,670
able to play a game at least and not on

362
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:51,830
your analysis machine and on the other

363
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,920
side you have players that when they are

364
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,620
installing these cheats are required by

365
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,100
the developers to disable the antivirus

366
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,300
they are installing rootkits

367
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,110
so you know cheats tonga detected some

368
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,780
I've read in forums are trying to use

369
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,390
code from apt actors such as Torah and

370
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,270
using like kernel stuff you know like

371
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,780
they have gone way beyond what I thought

372
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,150
it was possible and I think this is very

373
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,460
interesting and this is where it thinks

374
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,490
it's overlapping with the malware

375
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:30,230
ecosystem so I'm from Kaspersky we

376
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,300
recently launched or run teach it and I

377
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,850
was monitoring some forums and people

378
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,150
have began speaking about like hey do

379
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,210
you think this is worth like this do you

380
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,430
think it's going to hurt us and I don't

381
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,530
worry like it's it's Russian like

382
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,620
and then they would go like no no no I

383
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,540
think it's okay and you know so people

384
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,770
are taking notice into what a big

385
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,050
companies are doing in this area so

386
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:01,120
maybe we're new players to the game but

387
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,480
you know I imagine all of you at the

388
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,160
very least work related to something in

389
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,380
the security industry maybe for another

390
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,930
IV company so I think it's important for

391
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,600
us to take care and to protect also

392
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,650
gamers so if if you still don't have

393
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,210
that feature in your product I would

394
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,390
suggest like maybe take a look and as as

395
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,970
a professional I would say we need more

396
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,640
information within more collaboration so

397
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,850
we are having

398
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:35,130
blind spots for me for example that was

399
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,240
doing this presentation for my

400
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,040
colleagues and I got some questions that

401
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,770
I couldn't answer because there is a lot

402
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,350
of information that is private so for

403
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:49,060
example Epic Games has like a 100

404
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,420
million player base but it's not forced

405
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,040
to share that information with me how

406
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,810
many cheaters are there what are they

407
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,720
using what are the their methods for

408
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,470
combating this issue so our visibility

409
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,460
is still very low so again it's it's the

410
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,490
very same issue that it's like over and

411
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:16,420
over the same movie some takeaways for

412
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,440
you this is a growing illegal economy

413
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,620
this is not any more like one single

414
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,570
player against the computer doing

415
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,600
something shady this is people hurting

416
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,640
other people people who are losing their

417
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,540
jobs developers are forced to close so

418
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,090
this the extension of this is much more

419
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,830
than you would expect or you would

420
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,850
imagine so I thank you for being here

421
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,140
because with the title of my

422
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,390
presentation I don't know what did what

423
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,750
do you imagine but my idea is that I

424
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,120
usually choose topics that are not very

425
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,890
traditional to speak about because I

426
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,200
think that is like maybe in each area

427
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,440
that a lot of people are forgetting it's

428
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,900
really nice to work on a PT's to work on

429
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,470
financial threads trojan bankers but all

430
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,220
of threads are dirty

431
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,350
it's an emerging research area so if you

432
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,240
are looking into something to start

433
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,190
working on and you know what that is I

434
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,770
would suggest starting looking into this

435
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:24,160
I mean you have the knowledge you have

436
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,960
the skills

437
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,640
most of the cheese that you will find

438
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,070
nowadays especially the private ones are

439
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:34,890
heavily packed obfuscated they're using

440
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,870
commercial protectors as I said some

441
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,480
exhibit rootkit behavior maybe some

442
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,470
kernel drivers so this

443
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,740
is very complicated stuff but I think

444
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,600
that the people in this room can do it

445
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,530
so that is just regular cheats like the

446
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,450
Konami code then you have malware like

447
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,520
cheats and then you have also the

448
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,850
markets you have these pages that I

449
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,549
showed you before but also you need to

450
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:10,140
take into consideration that when you're

451
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,000
playing a game sometimes you're getting

452
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,340
items in exchange for your time and your

453
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,440
and you know the skills that you

454
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,169
demonstrate in that game so there is

455
00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:21,570
also like a gray and black market of

456
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,360
stolen items sometimes there are built

457
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,909
old food shops so if you want to level

458
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:29,159
up in let's say fortnight or I know

459
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:32,400
world Warcraft you can pay someone they

460
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,380
actually that is a sweatshop here in the

461
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,270
UK and that I know about you can pay

462
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,669
someone to play for you and after a

463
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:40,679
while you could get your character just

464
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,289
level up I don't know where the fun is

465
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:47,419
in not playing but you can pay for that

466
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:50,280
so there is also farming for example

467
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,000
where you can use like replay attack to

468
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,130
get virtual currency and then exchange

469
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,190
it for real currency so there are a lot

470
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,460
of different things to research here and

471
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,669
for me that's something that I will keep

472
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:08,970
doing after two years I think the last

473
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,440
time I did something related to gaming

474
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,900
was with my colleague Bob Paris he was

475
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,510
working in Panda and we did a research

476
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:20,030
about credential stealing related to bud

477
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:23,490
and I thought ok it's time to continue

478
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,250
with the topics so you would see a lot

479
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,110
of presentations here that are extremely

480
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,080
important extremely fun but then after

481
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,850
two years you say like what happened did

482
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,270
you continue with a topic it's not like

483
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,770
set it and forget it you will need to

484
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:44,010
keep worker it working at so cheat codes

485
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:47,730
in the indie IDs I did akuti anyone

486
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,659
remember that one doom

487
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:52,980
ok and the cheat codes now so you need

488
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,520
just a credit card a bag of money

489
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,980
just the willingness to to annoy other

490
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:05,330
people so the cake is a lie that phrases

491
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,420
for from the game portal - and you could

492
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,700
play the entire game on the premise or

493
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,260
on the promise actually that you would

494
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,720
get a cake at the end that game is

495
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,970
extremely difficult but when you finish

496
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:21,200
the game you are face to wall and there

497
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,380
is graffiti there that says the cake is

498
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,570
a lie there is no cake so you play the

499
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,730
entire game and you are extremely

500
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:33,260
disappointed and you know the idea with

501
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,530
this is that not everything looks what

502
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,810
it seems and I think this is the case

503
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,150
with videogame cheating this is an

504
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,980
illegal market this is an industry and

505
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,140
we can do something about it

506
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,640
thank you

507
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,809
