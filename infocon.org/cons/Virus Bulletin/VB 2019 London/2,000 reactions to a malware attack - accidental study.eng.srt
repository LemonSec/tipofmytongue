1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,520
Adam Hartley and my close okay good

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,470
enough from bad Cybercom is gonna talk

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,780
about what it's like to hear directly

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,960
from potential victims of an attack so

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,429
this is pretty exciting so I'm looking

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,250
forward to this okay thank you my name

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,830
is Adam I'm a journalist I used to be an

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,810
IT security officer but I quit my job

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,240
when gdpr started because I had enough

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,939
of this stuff and now I'm more I think

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,310
articles mainly in Polish that's because

12
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,520
why you perhaps don't know me I write on

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,410
the blog sulfinate register on Appel for

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,090
the Polish people in the in the room and

15
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,239
I also put some weekly notes on but

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,700
Cybercom where I intended to add more in

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,800
English but it's too much happening that

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,100
I don't have time to do it but I wanted

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,750
to tell you today about the story that

20
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,230
happens to me and I did not intend for

21
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,010
for the study to be run but it was run

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,859
by somebody else and I was an accidental

23
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,460
recipient of the results what happens

24
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,660
most of the things will be happening in

25
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,188
Polish but I will provide you with

26
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,979
translations don't worry and this is a

27
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,200
message that was sent to Polish users

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,229
more or less a year ago and it was a

29
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,900
simple malicious message it said you

30
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,670
have overdue deposits at the social

31
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,040
insurance institution the most known in

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,259
Poland and there was the link like the

33
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,950
first the second the second object on

34
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,439
the screen that deposits as of the date

35
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,530
and it was linked to a tiny upload

36
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,590
website so and there was a file word

37
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,570
document waiting for the victims

38
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,790
well the idea that somebody from the

39
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,860
Social Security insurance institution

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,320
could send a link to a tiny upload is

41
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,470
absurd enough but when you wanted to run

42
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,479
this payload when we wanted to end this

43
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,549
world file it actually did not execute

44
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,229
there was an error in in the

45
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,020
exploitation process the payload was

46
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,909
there but it could not be executed this

47
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,490
wasn't one of the RTF exploits one of

48
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,710
the recent CVS but it didn't work it

49
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,270
didn't work we tested on multiple

50
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,570
systems multiple office versions it did

51
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,300
not run and apparently the offer of this

52
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,900
attack realized they failed and they

53
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,189
move the file from the server an hour

54
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:15,739
later so good news nobody got infected

55
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,840
but this is interesting enough for me to

56
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,610
write an article about how the criminals

57
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,069
fail and I want to laugh at them I want

58
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:23,750
my readers to be happy that they felt

59
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,420
sorry welt an article and then fast

60
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,569
forward a year a day and a day later my

61
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:32,090
mother gets a message on her phone Adam

62
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,370
are you ready well this is strange

63
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,129
probably an error somebody made the

64
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:39,829
mistake I don't care and then five

65
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,959
minutes later this is my private mailbox

66
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:44,180
starts looking like this somebody's

67
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,980
answering messages I did not send and

68
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,909
the answers come in dozens a second so

69
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:51,799
this is like I don't know what's

70
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:56,720
happening so after a few hours the the

71
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,870
counter takes at about 2000 so I get

72
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,359
2,000 unsolicited messages I don't know

73
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:04,760
who's sending them and why but finally I

74
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,859
get to the original message that was

75
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:09,230
sent by the criminals who didn't like

76
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,359
apparent in my article a day earlier and

77
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:13,879
they sent another one very similar to

78
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,439
the previous one this time pretending to

79
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,910
be the largest Polish debt collection

80
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,160
agency saying you have some liabilities

81
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,230
and the code bailiff will come and take

82
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,769
matters in his hands the text has a lot

83
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:27,109
of typos a lot of spelling errors like

84
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:30,799
really really a lot and of course it

85
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,139
links to a file on an external server

86
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:36,379
this time on some other upload server

87
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:39,169
and the file is our archive with a PDF

88
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:43,129
dot X a file inside so why I'm getting

89
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:46,400
answers to that because they put my

90
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,409
private email address in the reply to

91
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:50,989
field so a simple trick they sending

92
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:54,169
from a fake mailbox using some some spam

93
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:56,780
services and they put my reply address

94
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,019
inside so when people start answering

95
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:02,540
that message they address me not their

96
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,760
cyber criminals so I get a unique

97
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,729
opportunity to look at these answers now

98
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:09,680
but in the meantime I get an SMS message

99
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,260
saying is Adam there so they must have

100
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,030
realized the previous attempt was failed

101
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,590
because they which my mother not me and

102
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,149
they ask if I'm there okay I'm I'm there

103
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,250
I'm asking who's asking and they say

104
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,988
your friends from the total network and

105
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:23,970
I say can you provide with statistics

106
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,040
probably and interview because I'm a

107
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,360
journalist I'm interested in how it

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,940
works and they say well we will send you

109
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,250
the statistics via mail and probably

110
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,110
we'll attach some anthrax to that well

111
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,750
nice joke well I don't care I'm not

112
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,630
opening letters from strangers anyway

113
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,400
but it was about the reactions of the

114
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,260
people who got that message and world

115
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,110
back to me so now to the reactions

116
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,120
because these are the most interesting

117
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,060
so I got almost 2,000 answers about a

118
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,669
hundred of them were automated but it

119
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:57,030
was almost 1900 real people who world me

120
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,620
so I read all those messages and

121
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,270
classified them into 11 different

122
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,820
categories and the most prevalent one

123
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,690
was can you explain this is a general

124
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,810
approach half of the people had and

125
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,789
almost a thousand messages I got with

126
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:14,580
questions like what is this about please

127
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,530
explain can you provide an invoice

128
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,020
number probably well I don't understand

129
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,120
what's the debt it was like a natural

130
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,039
real reaction people have when they are

131
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,289
told you have a debt outstanding and you

132
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:27,930
should pay it and those people did not

133
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,789
realize this is a malicious message they

134
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:31,740
were afraid by the debt collection

135
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,990
agency and they were wondering well Who

136
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,870
am I in depth to and this was there was

137
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,940
really like almost a thousand so I just

138
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,820
a few examples like this is normal this

139
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,990
is normal for people who do not

140
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,340
understand they were targeted by the

141
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,050
criminals who wants to explain the

142
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,639
situation they got a message they got

143
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,039
frightened they want to explain it then

144
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:51,900
there was a second group much smaller

145
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,630
which I call the question my group does

146
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,580
only 46 messages but they were very

147
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,979
similar so some people answered their

148
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:00,630
messages like that sample1 sample2

149
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,070
sample 2040 well I don't understand that

150
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,840
fully well how can you communicate like

151
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,340
that in the internet but apparently

152
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,560
people can okay no problem

153
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,780
this is not something bad well they just

154
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,280
wanted to get more information they

155
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,750
don't have time so it's the way to

156
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,050
address your sender so this is my

157
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,940
reaction when I when I saw this this

158
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,760
messages then there's a Fed group that I

159
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,370
have an alternative name of missed

160
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,590
opportunity because they could not find

161
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,990
the attachment they wanted to find the

162
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,770
attachment but

163
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,509
could not and it was almost 15 percent

164
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:35,849
of the of the people who got that

165
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:38,129
message if you look at that message can

166
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,930
you find the attachment yourself it's

167
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,419
not that simple it's here there was

168
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:43,830
supposed to be a picture but the picture

169
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,199
did not load they miss misspelled the

170
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,569
address so the picture did not load so

171
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:50,340
it was really a problem for the

172
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,690
criminals they could optimize the

173
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,610
process because like 15 percent who

174
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,470
wanted to open the attachment but could

175
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,539
not find it in the message so if you're

176
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:58,830
sending a message like that you should

177
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,419
be more careful about the link they

178
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,729
should be clicking so people were saying

179
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:04,139
like there's no attachment the

180
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,120
attachment is missing no attachment what

181
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,069
is this about they wanted to have an

182
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,810
attachment to this message they expected

183
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,020
it to be there they couldn't find it and

184
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,780
well there's if things can get worse and

185
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,550
as you work most of you I guess in

186
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,830
security you know things always can get

187
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,630
worse there's a group of people who

188
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,370
wanted to end the attachments and found

189
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,620
the attachment and attachment didn't

190
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,449
work why it didn't work because they

191
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:29,400
expected the PDF file and it was a PDF

192
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,740
not exif iso it did work but they didn't

193
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,750
see it working it worked in the

194
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,550
background and it was more than eleven

195
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,409
percent of people who actually installed

196
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:39,960
this malware on their computers and then

197
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,759
complained that they cannot open the

198
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,169
attachments or the attachment doesn't

199
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:45,870
open or it doesn't work or they wanted

200
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,759
the attachment to be sent because they

201
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,830
ran it and it didn't show the PDF file

202
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,500
and well some asked if i can they change

203
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,630
the file format for them to be able to

204
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,580
finally see the attachments and they

205
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,620
couldn't open the file i sent and they

206
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,599
some of them even asked me to send it

207
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,090
again and again and again because they

208
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,250
Guinea wanted to see the details this

209
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,529
was a fake message a poorly faked

210
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,050
message which was obviously fake and

211
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,849
they still wanted to know the details

212
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:13,110
because they did not realize there are

213
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,940
victims of an attack and they run the

214
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,380
malware on the computer and then

215
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,940
complained it didn't work as they

216
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,069
expected so this was me looking at those

217
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:23,069
messages well can it get worse you're

218
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,810
working 90 security you know it can get

219
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,490
worse so there were people who

220
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,110
complained that their antivirus blocked

221
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,199
that message so you're doing good job

222
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,578
which if you're working in AV industry

223
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:36,570
but people still are have this tendency

224
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,700
to go against you goes against your

225
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,078
product because they want to win that

226
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:42,149
message and here you prevent them from

227
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:44,070
doing so this was a little bit more than

228
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,790
2% of recipients and the

229
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,310
as I got is what's it's all about its se

230
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,440
survivors so they have an information on

231
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,330
their screen it's a virus and they still

232
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,890
don't understand it's a virus

233
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,960
so perhaps you should work more on

234
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,970
communicating the fact that it's a virus

235
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,790
or they're survivors one can I can't

236
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,040
open the file they complain they want a

237
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,690
new file because they can't open the

238
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,060
wonder you're blocking this Santas PDF

239
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,470
because this one is to recognize the

240
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,470
survivors okay so even if you already

241
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,150
stopped the malicious file on their

242
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,040
computers and you tell them it's wrong

243
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,410
it's a virus it's a danger they still

244
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,940
don't understand they are being

245
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,130
victimized at the very moment they don't

246
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,020
get it and it's a quite a large

247
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,940
population of people who are like my

248
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,400
antivirus doesn't like rar files what it

249
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,020
happens well it doesn't like the

250
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,720
exercise poop on the inside but it was

251
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,630
deleted by my antivirus please resend so

252
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,550
this is normal people reacting to you

253
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,230
trying to stop them from getting

254
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,900
infected and this is the the most famous

255
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,210
cartoon not saying that there's Dave

256
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,740
human error in the right column in the

257
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,880
left column you've got firewalls

258
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,040
encryption etc but they for you always

259
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,050
win if he wants to do it I've got an

260
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,060
example of one of my readers who got

261
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,610
infected where after she tried to end

262
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,660
the fight on her computer

263
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,490
I didn't worksheet so she transferred it

264
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,020
to another computer where she didn't

265
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,370
have the antivirus and run it there

266
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,670
because she wanted to run the file so

267
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,020
people don't understand what you're

268
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,850
saying them when when they get infected

269
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,760
and I don't know if you have a vast

270
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,440
people in the room but one of those

271
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,780
messages came back to me that classic

272
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,370
have a signature this message is for

273
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,550
viruses there was a link in this message

274
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,770
leading directly to a virus file so

275
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,690
technically the communication is true

276
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,430
this message did not include a virus it

277
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,530
did include a link to the virus so

278
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,330
probably you should revise that message

279
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,800
when you're when you're attaching it to

280
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,770
the message to the mails so this was me

281
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,890
when when seeing this message there was

282
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,630
also a group which pretended they

283
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,060
reported me to me as a malware offer day

284
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,760
they expected to the authorities and it

285
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,290
was not an significant it was more than

286
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,170
five percent they were saying like I

287
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,730
reported you to the police one more

288
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,650
message and I report you like a threat

289
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,440
or bad luck I'm a lawyer and I reported

290
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,200
you already

291
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,850
there is some of them that didn't

292
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,830
address the police they address the

293
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,570
prosecutor's office which is also a fine

294
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,520
way to report crime in Poland you can go

295
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,280
both ways it's up to you to choose but

296
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,130
actually all of those messages arrived

297
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,290
like in field up to four hours after the

298
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,200
initial spam so I believe all of them

299
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,720
were lies because I know how it works

300
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,400
and it's technically unfeasible to

301
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,350
report a cyber crime in Poland in three

302
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,380
hours time so I think they all lied to

303
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,390
they're criminals I don't know why but

304
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,520
what what you should look at is what

305
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,020
they were reporting because they were

306
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,330
not reporting malicious messages where

307
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,910
we were reporting a fraud attempt

308
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,380
because they didn't have a depth so they

309
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,910
expected that message to be a fraud

310
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,950
attempt they expected that somebody

311
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,690
wanted to steal their money telling them

312
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,640
they owe someone they did not see the

313
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,290
virus that did not see the link that did

314
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,670
not see the attachment they what they

315
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,400
thought it was a fraud attempt so good

316
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,410
they identified something wrong with the

317
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,060
message but the identification was wrong

318
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,310
they did not understand what was the aim

319
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,410
of the attacker at all so this is

320
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,780
missing them when they say they reported

321
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,180
me to the police

322
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,550
some of the people actually understood

323
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,080
what's happening at least I assume they

324
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,490
did but still choose the wrong way to

325
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,590
address it because they wrote me well I

326
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,560
see you are a hacker but what's the

327
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,570
sense of writing somebody I see you are

328
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,000
a hacker well some people think it's a

329
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,120
good idea and some say please send the

330
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,220
files via traditional my I don't respond

331
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,590
to other frauds so this is an indication

332
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,620
for the criminals somebody says what a

333
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,360
fool one has to be to send a virus and

334
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,280
hope someone open some opens it well my

335
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,750
question is what a fool someone has to

336
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,190
be to write to the hacker and tell him

337
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,020
that well you're losing he'll time

338
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,050
they're not reading that at all there

339
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,850
was one expert who said there's no sense

340
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,580
in compressing PDF files so he got a

341
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,220
wire message with a PDF exit inside and

342
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,230
he's such an expert that hits knows you

343
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,120
should not compress PDF files but he's

344
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,670
not expecting to see - and exacts

345
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,420
tension afterwards and one even world a

346
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,640
message directly in English which I

347
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,590
didn't have to translate thanks God I

348
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,510
have the last word preparing the slides

349
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,540
well I don't know why but he just

350
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,370
decided to address me in English so this

351
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:08,950
is how

352
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,650
I see those people and of course

353
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,780
obviously there was a group which wanted

354
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,070
to tell me what they think about my

355
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,460
attack and there was like what almost

356
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,890
six percent of the recipients of the

357
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,900
messages I got some of them were already

358
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,750
in English which is quite a surprise

359
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,340
perhaps people watch a lot of movies in

360
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,720
English and they prefer to swear in

361
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,610
English because it's shorter it's like

362
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,650
more international they feel more fancy

363
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,870
when they swear in English but my most

364
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,450
favourite one is when the swears mix

365
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,610
with the standard signature I won't

366
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,680
quote it so I don't get recalled in

367
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,590
swearing but please please read the last

368
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,220
two lines so well people people send

369
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,450
messages like that and think it's

370
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,470
professional well they can but there are

371
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,080
some people who prefer to communicate in

372
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,060
graphics so they have folders of

373
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,150
pictures like that and I can imagine the

374
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,220
guy sitting at his computer and clicking

375
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,700
folder responses graphic negative

376
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,790
you so and then there's a subfolder with

377
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,410
animated gifs this is the this is the

378
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,670
one where a little of I like the guy of

379
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,950
course there are people also who know

380
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,870
there's gdpr I love them

381
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,240
as we all do there's so many of them

382
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,910
like 27 only but the messages they sent

383
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,430
were always around please remove me from

384
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,550
your depth released because of gdpr so

385
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,860
it was not likely move my data because I

386
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,570
don't want it to be processed it was

387
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,940
more like I probably I have some debts

388
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,310
but I want to invoke GDP I so I can get

389
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,380
rid of them so you have to delete me

390
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,030
from your database and you won't address

391
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,610
me again and you won't talk to me again

392
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,190
so as I'll say GDP our one month time

393
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,880
and and I shoot you as I mentioned the

394
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,770
message had a lot of spelling errors

395
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,960
like really really a lot and of course

396
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,910
there were people who had the

397
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,160
opportunity to express themselves and

398
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,410
their their feeling towards the the fact

399
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,960
that I made so many errors and they

400
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,810
really wanted me to get better at my my

401
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,510
campaigns and they some of them even

402
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,550
wrote well for such a professional

403
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,200
company so that collection agency you

404
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,540
making too many spelling mistakes so

405
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,280
this happens this happens apparently

406
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,230
people care

407
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,880
about the fact that other people are

408
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,850
making spelling mistakes online well

409
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,820
this is missing them I'm saying that

410
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,580
that I made those mistakes but the most

411
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,680
surprising category this is why I left

412
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,660
it at the end is the people who found

413
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,160
the message totally you got events to

414
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,870
the current financial situation and

415
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,740
there was 42 people who wrote two kinds

416
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,700
of messages one was I've already paid so

417
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,610
these four people really had that and

418
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,980
complains that they did pay and why are

419
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,750
we flattening them because they did pay

420
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,960
their debts and they wanted me to verify

421
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,930
and check if they if I booked their

422
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,660
payments correctly so even if you don't

423
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,550
totally target your campaign because

424
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,200
apparently looking at the results it was

425
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,150
not targeted at depth airs at all you

426
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,920
can still reach people who will find the

427
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,320
message as relevant but this is like

428
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,880
half of the problem the other half is

429
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,570
people who say I want to pay my debts I

430
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:21,000
really do so the message which people

431
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,250
who had deaths didn't pay them and after

432
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,040
reading it they decided to pay so it's

433
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,750
like the criminals were acting as

434
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,900
helpers to the to the agency to recover

435
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,420
the debt actually because they wanted to

436
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,320
to pay so the criminals actually

437
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,730
obtained a positive effect on the

438
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,370
economy because they persuaded some

439
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,600
people to pay their debts

440
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,180
at least to contact the the the the

441
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,220
collection agency and to ask for an

442
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,920
account number for installments etc so

443
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,510
no matter what they write in the message

444
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,760
they will still reach somebody who's who

445
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,950
feels it's for him it's very dedicated

446
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,590
to his situation so this is me looking

447
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:02,550
at those answers in the totality of

448
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,180
answers I found two positive things two

449
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,710
positive answers this were two

450
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,020
accountants ladies who wrote I will not

451
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,359
open the attachments I don't do it well

452
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,609
that's the perfect answer would be not

453
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,770
answering that message at all but at

454
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,869
least there are people who realize these

455
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:21,060
are threats this who read the messages

456
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,579
and analyze them and can react in the

457
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,800
correct way we would expect our users to

458
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,680
react so actually this is this is

459
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,350
something worth of applauding but the

460
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,500
message I found the best of them all is

461
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,520
a letter

462
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,770
well written by a lawyer so the

463
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,960
recipient of the malicious message went

464
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,760
to his lawyer probably paid him some

465
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,130
money and they wrote a letter together

466
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,100
which is signed and stamped and they the

467
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,530
letter says a lot of legal things saying

468
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,020
that the totally fake message is not

469
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,450
correctly found and the criminals

470
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,640
actually don't know the law and they

471
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,980
they don't apply correct phrases and

472
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,690
correct sentences I wasn't even able to

473
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,190
translate it because it's a full of

474
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,770
legal language and I'm not that that

475
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,140
fluent with with that part of English so

476
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,240
this is really like people get this

477
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,500
malicious message and instead of

478
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,120
deleting it they go to their lawyer and

479
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,070
they pay him to prepare an answer so

480
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,380
this is the level of misunderstanding of

481
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,360
what's actually happening in the world

482
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,850
so coming back to the statistics you can

483
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,429
see that like almost 70 percent was the

484
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:26,340
the was created by three types of answer

485
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,320
like can you explain me and the

486
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,730
attachment doesn't work on was the

487
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,410
attachment so these are people who

488
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,540
totally didn't understand they are being

489
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,390
attacked and I don't know the number of

490
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,040
messages that was sent out by the

491
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,710
criminals this is not not available but

492
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,809
based on some previous campaigns

493
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:44,840
previous history I assume it was like

494
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,910
twenty to fifty thousand probably so the

495
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,010
answer way it was somewhere between two

496
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,860
and five percent what I got what I

497
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,280
really got those messages so now what do

498
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,870
I do with those messages because I get

499
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,270
them like 15 every minute and I need to

500
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,470
do something with that I cannot leave

501
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,510
these people without an answer so I

502
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,040
tried answering manually in the first

503
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,330
minute but after a minute I realized

504
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,490
it's not the way so I set up an auto

505
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,610
answer in Gmail and this is the message

506
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,890
I send to those people I try to be as

507
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,320
brief as possible I provided a link to a

508
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,240
very detailed description of this attack

509
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,850
I already put on my website and I told

510
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,160
them to contact an IT expert to either

511
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,080
remove the malware or just waste of the

512
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,910
system as the simplest way to get rid of

513
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,300
it

514
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,790
so imagine people were answering that

515
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,500
message as well of course so they did

516
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,780
and some of the answers were a little

517
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,500
bit surprising which shows that they

518
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,110
actually did not understand even me

519
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,790
trying to explain them they were getting

520
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,250
infected and some of them were really

521
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,410
like totally not understanding then why

522
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,659
I am sending this this is the question

523
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:50,789
and I cannot explain to them more than I

524
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,679
did already so you've got people who

525
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,720
have antivirus installed that you still

526
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,220
get infected then you send them a

527
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,019
message they get infected and explain to

528
00:19:58,019 --> 00:19:59,669
them how how to remove that message and

529
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:01,649
they still don't understand even if you

530
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:03,629
personally intervened and try to explain

531
00:20:03,629 --> 00:20:05,519
to them that they actually got infected

532
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,039
so it's not that easy it's not that it's

533
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,109
me looking at those answers of course

534
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:12,679
there were people who thanked me for

535
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:15,720
informing them what's happening so it

536
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,700
was quite a positive feeling that that

537
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,960
there are people who understand what I

538
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,269
wrote them and probably I saved a few of

539
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:23,489
them from getting infected or getting

540
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:24,889
their money stolen

541
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:28,739
afterwards but now I wanted to show you

542
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:31,619
a few reactions that we generally as a

543
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:35,639
security people have fought this case of

544
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:38,489
incidence I gathered reactions from my

545
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:40,649
readers I write us on a security blog

546
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:43,019
and I get comments from my readers I

547
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:45,330
assume most of them are at least IT or

548
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,179
in a large part also IT security people

549
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,159
because who other would read those

550
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,499
articles I write so this is what people

551
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:55,049
actually write under my articles like

552
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:56,909
I'm waiting for another article I

553
00:20:56,909 --> 00:20:59,820
describing an attack and they say it's a

554
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,889
new attack so I think about it to warn

555
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:03,840
people about it so they can Google the

556
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,609
attack and find out that it's it's an

557
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:07,259
attack and some people say what are you

558
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:09,299
sweat what's new in that it's just

559
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,549
another malicious man some people say

560
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:14,249
why do people still fall for it why it's

561
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:16,409
been known for ages well it's been known

562
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,149
for ages but for you not for them that's

563
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:21,419
simple and well some of them are even

564
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:22,919
like what's wrong with you people

565
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:24,090
why are you leaking all those

566
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,700
attachments well it shows a deeper level

567
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,279
level of not understanding the human

568
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,710
nature not understanding the fact that

569
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,809
the recipients of these messages are not

570
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:35,789
IT people they're not IT security people

571
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:38,039
they treat their computers as we treat

572
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,809
our cars I know there's an engine behind

573
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:41,429
me but I don't know how it works I

574
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:43,470
cannot repair it it's too complicated

575
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,539
now and they treat their computers like

576
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,159
we treat our cars they just drive it and

577
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,379
they don't care and we as IT security

578
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:51,269
people don't understand them because we

579
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:53,279
leave this life and we are inside and we

580
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,960
cannot understand how it happens that

581
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,999
they still click those messages well as

582
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:58,559
long as we just don't understand it I

583
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,809
think it's fine it shows some level of

584
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:02,820
this reflection but there are people who

585
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,279
believe their user side idiots and they

586
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:07,230
are saying then like you have to be an

587
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,600
idiot from the woods to create it no no

588
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,429
you can be a doctor can be a lawyer you

589
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:12,899
can live in a big city no problem you

590
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:13,799
can still click it

591
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,480
some people say they are blind fools

592
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,759
they read the message as I showed you

593
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,740
they read the message but they still did

594
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,899
not see it's an attack someone was born

595
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:23,730
stupid she won't die a genius yes sure

596
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,620
but it's true about people putting such

597
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,200
comments online also and people are

598
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,629
really idiots yes that's true also

599
00:22:29,629 --> 00:22:31,559
regarding those people putting those

600
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,749
comments or stupid monkeys yeah I like

601
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:35,309
monkeys monkeys are fine they are not

602
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:36,720
stupid at all they are just on their

603
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,749
level then there's another kind of

604
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:42,059
reactions which I would be hate which is

605
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:43,499
like why should we protect them they are

606
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:44,039
worthless

607
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:47,899
they are just users users like trash and

608
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:50,340
this is written by people working in IT

609
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,499
security this is not something I

610
00:22:52,499 --> 00:22:54,360
invented this I will direct quotes from

611
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,950
people working in the industry I don't

612
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,139
know names I don't want blame to blame

613
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:00,360
those people by name but I want to blame

614
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,379
the the the the whole the whole industry

615
00:23:04,379 --> 00:23:06,570
for for this kind of plot like they

616
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,269
deserve to be hacked I don't pity them

617
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:12,230
well I do pity them at least have some

618
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,519
understanding that the criminals are

619
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,230
earning money this way and we should

620
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,879
stop them from any money if not for

621
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:19,230
saving the victims then from to

622
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,179
preventing the criminals from making

623
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,340
money so let's look at the answers

624
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,960
people give how can we solve this

625
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,720
phenomenon once and for all like they

626
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,999
should use more brains more than the

627
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:32,820
antivirus well perfect solution but in

628
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,960
order to use the brain you should have

629
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,179
one says another expert well excellent

630
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,399
excellent you just solve the the IT

631
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:41,070
security problem Bravo to you and then

632
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,259
others people ask did this app install

633
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:45,210
themselves well destroy humans but

634
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,830
humans are required to install apps

635
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,080
humans are required they are get paid to

636
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,149
open attachments so now you expect them

637
00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:53,759
not to open attachments I once had a

638
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,490
incident in the company I worked in

639
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,679
and accountant open and attachments open

640
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,059
she open an invoice it's her job to

641
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,130
opening the invoice but she infected her

642
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,170
computer fed time in the week and my

643
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,540
friend who wants to address hurt us but

644
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,460
how could you open it it's so obvious

645
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,740
it's a virus and she looks at him and

646
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,690
says if it's so obvious why didn't you

647
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,600
stop it and that's a fair question if

648
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,350
it's so obvious so it happens and some

649
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,820
say they should be a driving crisis

650
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,309
equivalent for computers well it's a

651
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:25,820
good idea because as you know after we

652
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,960
implemented their driving crisis

653
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,460
requirement for people to drive cars

654
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,210
accident stops yes they did yeah not so

655
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,210
not so exactly so this is this one solve

656
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,820
the issuance one final solution lobotomy

657
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,250
this is a real suggestion by an IT

658
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,140
expert how can we solve the user problem

659
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,160
just kill them that's simple and we'll

660
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,679
have a wonderful life with no problem in

661
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,140
front of us and this was a simple attack

662
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,030
simple attack that people got fooled by

663
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,070
a simple attack from time to time and do

664
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,870
you know this attack do you know what's

665
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,420
wrong in this picture you have a website

666
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,600
that has a ssl certificate and extended

667
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,860
certificate with a company name

668
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,650
everything seems fine

669
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,179
fortunately the criminals don't use it

670
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:12,690
very often the window inside is is just

671
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,540
jaw drawn in JavaScript this is an

672
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,210
object inside the larger window it has a

673
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,030
certificate it has a green lock

674
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,320
fortunately it was the only one attack I

675
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,030
saw like that because if criminals

676
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,520
started using it then all the education

677
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,170
we put in our users will die immediately

678
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:30,120
because they see a green lock they see

679
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,860
the extended certificate they see

680
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,350
correct URL name but this is a window

681
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,640
inside the window you can even move it

682
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,309
you can minimize it you can maximize it

683
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:39,660
you cannot move outside the main window

684
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,150
because it's driven inside the main

685
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,190
window but it's a simple attack it's

686
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,110
simple to implement and let's hope

687
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,550
criminals won't use it more often

688
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:50,970
Oh which of you recognize this is not a

689
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:53,309
direct link this is opened of a direct

690
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:54,420
or actually two of them

691
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,880
this is a link criminals used a few

692
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,130
weeks ago these are two opened by diets

693
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,050
in one link and the actual website they

694
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,030
will end on is the is the last line of

695
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,940
this link so if you expect our users to

696
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,160
understand the attacks we should look at

697
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,750
them from a different perspective we

698
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,340
shouldn't expect them understanding the

699
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,990
attacks if you look at this they won't

700
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,880
understand it never never it would not

701
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,679
happen we will not be able to explain it

702
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:20,220
to them how it works so actually this is

703
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,840
this is the quote by the founder of the

704
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,850
Heine net honey project I don't know if

705
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,740
it was his original invention or oh

706
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,750
there was someone before him but I

707
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,700
really liked it people are not the

708
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,919
weakest thing they are the attack vector

709
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:33,270
so if you change this mentality and

710
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,640
don't treat them as the weakest link in

711
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,169
our organization but treat them as an

712
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:39,120
attack vector that we should protect and

713
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,860
this is our responsibility to protect

714
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,410
them not their responsibility to react

715
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,630
correctly to all those attacks then I

716
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,880
hope we will be able to actually change

717
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,410
something and not just complain about

718
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:53,130
how stupid they are so this is my last

719
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,720
site if you want to get in touch want to

720

00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:59,040

722

touch I'd be happy to talk about how can

726
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,990
we solve that problem because I so far I

727
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:13,340
have not seen a good solution

728
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,470
Thank You thanks Thank You Adam that was

729
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,710
fascinating
