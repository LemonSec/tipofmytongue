1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,340
hi everyone thanks for coming I'm gonna

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,170
start today about exploring the Chinese

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,379
destroyed landscape

4
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:09,269
my name is Ignacio a medium security

5
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,120
researcher intercept animal research and

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,880
hunter you should have specialized on

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,920
Linux malware and I found some extensive

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,670
in a file format research over the years

9
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,720
so the outline of this talk is going to

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,820
be based on I think five different

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,279
points first we're gonna start the

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,050
overview of the Chinese state sponsor

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,810
dealers operations then we're going to

14
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,729
talk about notorious cybercrime Chinese

15
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,480
Jesus do stray grand Actos then we're

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,940
going to talk about how we collect

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,559
intelligence and then how we analyze

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,879
that intelligence and then we're gonna

19
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,530
head to the conclusions that the

20
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,600
intelligent intelligence analysis lead

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,500
us so overview of the Chinese

22
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,579
state-sponsored dis operation so these

23
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:51,660
are significant there has been a

24
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,070
significant rise of these attacks in

25
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,350
recent years and a large proportion of

26
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,500
them have have been China have had

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,989
Chinese origins and China itself as a

28
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,850
nation-state has emerged as having one

29
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,640
of the highest rates of these attacks

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,430
these this graph is from from kaspersky

31
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,400
from where q1 and q2 and it's a graph

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,760
that states that the source of DDoS

33
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,710
attacks prepare nation state and we can

34
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,110
clearly see that China overpasses every

35
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,700
other nation state some major DDoS

36
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,180
attacks for example the one that

37
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,000
contacted by by China as a nation state

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,490
we can highlight the one on rate fire on

39
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,060
2015 referees and the Chinese censorship

40
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,409
our organization they did some report

41
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,000
antenna we can clearly see that some of

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,979
the most of the DDoS attacks came from

43
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,060
China some although some other worst of

44
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,979
all mentions attacks against github on

45
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,470
2015 and 2017 mostly related to the

46
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,380
great fire attacks as well and recently

47
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,600
and but also happened in 2015 there were

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,780
also telegram attacks the judo success

49
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,200
the job 2019 ones seems to be influenced

50
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,869
by the Hong Kong and Chinese tensions

51
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:09,449
due to the rise of excitation bills

52
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,758
apply fide China

53
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:14,450
to Hong Kong but anyways we can see that

54
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,410
China is it's not uncommon to see a DDoS

55
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,260
attacks being applied bit deployed by

56
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,800
China for for the most part political

57
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,160
motivated goals however the Muslim

58
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,420
another important fact is that there is

59
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,810
a very prevalent dealers ecosystem in

60
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,960
China cybercrime and

61
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,760
and we have seen that there is a very

62
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,170
seedy piece and artifacts that overlap

63
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,180
from different Chinese several current

64
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,610
groups where we have done is bait

65
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,380
hypotheses on Chinese cybercrime

66
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,550
instance based on technical intelligence

67
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,040
collection and this is a graph of some

68
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,470
of the groups that we will be talking

69
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,920
about so there are numerous Chinese

70
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,870
productors the planned DDoS attacks and

71
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,420
this is not new

72
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,860
however most deals malware have

73
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,750
ambiguous attribution among these groups

74
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,840
so we don't know from which leaders

75
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,910
which group group some of the malware

76
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,040
can I come from and we don't know the

77
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,140
Hydra the hierarchy of these groups

78
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,610
either so it's a very ambiguous

79
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,040
ecosystem how about the two groups now

80
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,989
I'm mainly going to talk about is the

81
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,239
ones that are more active today which is

82
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,380
China Sea and needle so China Sea was

83
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,640
first reported by malware Mazda in

84
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,400
November 2014 and they have been that

85
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,140
the main developers behind the Linux

86
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,000
node and Linux Bill Gates which are one

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,030
of the most predominant Linux boats and

88
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,820
in Linux I mean Lido sports in Linux and

89
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,070
they have been operating as from at

90
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,670
least late 2013 and therefore their

91
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,140
bonus have abilities to deploy different

92
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,630
different sources of DDoS attacks they

93
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,830
have also closed far more a

94
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,820
cross-platform

95
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,650
dealers tools this was reported by Abbas

96
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,989
and they have done several tax and the

97
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:58,190
one most relevant was one against a 12

98
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,940
root name service of 15 as reported by K

99
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,380
whole 360 this is a timeline of some of

100
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,049
the malware that has been attributed to

101
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,780
this group and this group was not

102
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,630
actually seen as a group at some point

103
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,430
like the community didn't know whether

104
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,039
it was a global was at reducta however

105
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,349
over that over time it has been

106
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:23,090
speculated there is indeed a group this

107
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,270
is not Altima under all the

108
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,800
where that comes from this group but

109
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,210
it's more it's probably the most

110
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,479
relevant one a scene from Elle not on mm

111
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,470
mm mm 13 to mr. Larkin 2015 and then

112
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,060
such a vote at the end of 2018

113
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,259
we have seen this malware being hosted

114
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,000
together several occasions like for

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,819
example this is a panel in which we can

116
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:46,590
seal into Bill Gates and iptables hosted

117
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,020
together mr. black and China said the

118
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,759
first boat I was actually attributed to

119
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,430
China said hosted together

120
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,479
Jesus client Bill Gates hosted together

121
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,110
but also if we plot a con reuse base

122
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,870
graph we can see that a malware from

123
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,130
2013 and 2016 have high volume of

124
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,050
Korea's connections and we can see here

125
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,419
in this graph two clusters one is there

126
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,449
again the malware that we've seen from

127
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:16,139
2013 to 2016 they have a high common

128
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:19,050
code base and then we see another little

129
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,630
cluster which is chat about and chat

130
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,930
about basically spins is been known that

131
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,729
he's been sharing code without not but

132
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:29,370
for some reason it doesn't it has a

133
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,180
modified code base however we actually

134
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,039
do the same thing and we applied instead

135
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,960
of a careers based graph a string review

136
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,699
spacecraft we see that all of this mod

137
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,360
work becomes United so this is indeed a

138
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,669
proof that at some point all of this mod

139
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:47,159
might have that the same actual code

140
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:50,400
base come on victus of China said have

141
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,139
been too small to medium sized local

142
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,599
businesses local businesses online

143
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:57,779
gaming sites ecommerce shops forums and

144
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,639
on the monetization of this group has

145
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,319
been achieved by deploying DDoS attacks

146
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,069
as a service

147
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:03,990
the maintainer ransom just of the

148
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,389
specify attacks and has been speculated

149
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:07,979
that this group has been also sharing

150
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,479
selling code through Chinese forums

151
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,180
which which could have also been a

152
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,680
source of anticipation and this could

153
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,590
explain why we see a different mark were

154
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,690
like chacha bought which allegedly have

155
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,240
been example and had the same code base

156
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,300
as china says mob war but they have now

157
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,900
using utilizing a different code base on

158
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,310
the other hand we seen it all and it'll

159
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,900
is a pretty old

160
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,210
malware group was first discovered

161
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,430
around August 2011

162
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,160
and this this opponent was mainly

163
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,440
targeting windows and infections from

164
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,270
this mod bundle was were more prevalent

165
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,120
in China and neither infected inputs

166
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,150
were discovered to have to be in

167
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,500
residing in counterfeit versions of

168
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,240
Windows this implies that maybe the

169
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,770
malware at some point was installed

170
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,460
during the assembly and manufacturing

171
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,680
process of the systems on 2010 I mean

172
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,590
sorry on 2012 Microsoft took legal

173
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,780
action against needle and they basically

174
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,750
sinkhole one of the most predominant DNS

175
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,970
domains I mean sorry the yeah the

176
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,310
estimates are that it was utilizing for

177
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,040
C&C communication which was 3 3 2 2 dot

178
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,150
org and it'll had a very particular way

179
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:22,170
of opera of operating so basically they

180
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,770
did a DLL hijacking or the DLL

181
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,980
sideloading or whatever is called today

182
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,970
which basically this implies this

183
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,710
basically means that they will actually

184
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,260
drop a DLL with the same name of some

185
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,010
genuine DLL that will be always loaded

186
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,110
by every process this is the case also

187
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,060
with kind of 32 another critical dll's

188
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,870
and all happen is that they will drop a

189
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,070
malicious version of this DLL and every

190
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,470
other process will load this DLL after

191
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,810
this DLL is drop there is another

192
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,320
malware that will be unpacked which is

193
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,700
surf start and this is a definition by

194
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,320
fire right and we see that fire

195
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,560
attributes it literally to nito and as

196
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,870
far as we know this malware has now been

197
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,710
open source so it's mainly attributed to

198
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,650
Neto because of that reason this is some

199
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,380
dynamic analysis with interser and we

200
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,700
can see that if we run it'll at some

201
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,570
point we get some surf star modules ok

202
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,400
so now we're going to talk about the

203
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,570
intellection intelligence collections

204
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,400
and everything everything to start with

205
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,900
these screen shot and this is a screen

206
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,780
shot of one of our honey pots and the

207
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,820
heat of this Hollywood led us to this

208
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,100
panel for the ones that don't know this

209
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,919
is an HTTP file server and this is the

210
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:38,220
way the common way that Chinese trade

211
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,220
actors host their malware and and that

212
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,440
kind of stuff and here we see several

213
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,320
different malware we see that Windows

214
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,330
binary at the beginning a binary dice

215
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,080
and all the windows

216
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,550
Honore but is the actual binary of the

217
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,640
HTTP file HTTP file server julian x

218
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,450
binaries and compress archive the two

219
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,590
Linux binaries I don't know if is very

220
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,680
if it's clear but the Chilean expiry

221
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,600
this is some code reuse analysis by into

222
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,050
sir we can see that there are bill gates

223
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,600
and the bill gates as we seen is some

224
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,300
Chinese unknown Chinese in our the

225
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,070
windows malware is actually a modified

226
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,980
version of ghost rat which is also an

227
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,870
open source allegedly Chinese malware

228
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,750
and at some point we wanted to know if

229
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,070
whether this tumor was working working

230
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,320
were operated by the same actor with

231
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,770
reverse engineer we saw the CNC and they

232
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,540
were having the same double

233
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,560
communicating with the same domain

234
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,760
although they were communicated through

235
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,960
different ports but makes sense but

236
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,150
overall we assume that they were

237
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,720
operated by by the same actor then we

238
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,910
have the compressed archive this is some

239
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,130
of the binary stick contained and then

240
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,050
of the day what it was it was a little

241
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,090
stool and this Dido stool will be able

242
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,050
to deploy these attacks and even a brute

243
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,070
force different servers and do some

244
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,370
various of of methodologies and we saw

245
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,530
also these series of Dido stools hosted

246
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,190
in Chinese Linux in Chinese forms we

247
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,180
didn't we don't know whether these

248
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,440
leaders tools have been actually written

249
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,540
by China said or have been actually

250
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,300
purchased by China set or whatnot and

251
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,430
among all of the files from the China

252
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,890
from the from these days of stalls we

253
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,320
saw that this specific script which was

254
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,270
the one that was used to deploy

255
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,720
brute-force attacks and we send this as

256
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,370
the same script was the one that we saw

257
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,950
when we got the login and honeypot so we

258
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,590
assume that they actual the actual

259
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,150
intrusion in our holy pot was actually

260
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,720
deployed with this tool so we did we did

261
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,690
some also some reverse DNS lookups in

262
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,980
order to find more servers or whatnot

263
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,790
and we found a various service same

264
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,380
domain same name convention in the

265
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,420
binaries and also the same type of

266
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,970
binaries also we found another

267
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,800
compressed archive same thing it was a

268
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,480
Dios tool for Windows and ok this is

269
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,160
some of the intelligence that we collect

270
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,390
obviously I cannot sherrilyn tell you

271
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,900
that we collect but as you

272
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,000
as a quick buck as a quick overview this

273
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,690
is the sum this is how it looks like

274
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,940
from the collection interns collection

275
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,160
perspective and now we did the analysis

276
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,340
of them and after active our collection

277
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,990
we investigated the collected samples

278
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,030
and so on we did a we analyzed the

279
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,800
connections that we had and we found

280
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,030
interesting findings that we really

281
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,590
different groups together and among them

282
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,890
are China said Tennessee and Mittal so

283
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,270
among all the different findings we

284
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,120
found we highlighted three things one of

285
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,100
them is that China said two sets contain

286
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,620
any two artifacts and I'm pretty sure by

287
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,930
now that you realize that in both of the

288
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,190
compressed archives that I showed in

289
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,410
previous slides there was this the lpk

290
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,990
that they allow when we did our curious

291
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,520
analysis of this deal we obviously seen

292
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,170
little curry use another interesting

293
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,530
fact is that when we run the DLL we saw

294
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,210
obviously surf start but then we saw a

295
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,920
pirate instance for the ones that don't

296
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,730
know parade this is a funny factor and

297
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,040
it's been known that on 2010 there was a

298
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,490
wave of a there was a world away from

299
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,350
2010 that compromised a lot of Chinese

300
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,420
service so these ma this malware might

301
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,770
actually be operating on already

302
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,940
compromised service by some other actor

303
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,620
the other thing is so China said we

304
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,700
found out that China said I need to

305
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,710
share infrastructure and careers so we

306
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,810
among all the different partners that we

307
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,840
found we found this one which hosted a

308
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,610
Linux instances of DDoS client and

309
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,570
window sisters so mr. black when we did

310
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,660
Co Rios analysis we saw that a share

311
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,340
code with different malware but we saw

312
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,840
that mr. blog was showing cope with surf

313
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,240
star and when we analyzed that

314
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,830
connection we saw that they were sharing

315
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,780
the same various functions and one of

316
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,640
those functions was the same identical

317
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,910
as include implementation and they even

318
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,380
shared the same comments and everything

319
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,970
and let's remember for a second

320
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,830
either mr. black of surf star open

321
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:01,210
source on the other hand we found more

322
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,570
more panels and we also found Linux in

323
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,480
this in this case Linux vs. of mr. black

324
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,160
hosted with modified versions of search

325
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,640
of surf start these are some curious

326
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,470
analysis we can see clearly that one in

327
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,610
this one is mr. black and

328
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,209
I serve start and this is a comparison

329
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:22,329
of the new search that we found hosted

330
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:23,980
with mr. black in compression with the

331
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,390
ones that was B that were being used

332
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,209
with natal and we can see clearly that I

333
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:31,779
mean in this in this picture that a

334
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:34,029
there is a slightly different code base

335
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:35,709
you know or the college was modified at

336
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:38,140
some point and also the completion

337
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,910
status of these binaries were relatively

338
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,209
new comparison with knowing how old

339
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:47,110
metal is and another thing that we found

340
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,110
out is that these there is a lot of

341
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,670
Chinese model that we use the same

342
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,730
specific Forks of a specific open source

343
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,339
now where so let's go back at the

344
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:59,380
beginning on the first panel that we

345
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,290
show we saw we explained that there is

346
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,329
this minor e called bx e dot exe which

347
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:06,339
was a ghostwriter instance and

348
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:09,040
BitDefender reported this report on our

349
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,329
Integra PTO person so pizza and we're in

350
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:14,709
the report one of the things that they

351
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:16,779
highlight is that they found a specific

352
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:19,000
goals rat variants that were explicitly

353
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,420
exclude Li used by our Integra PT and

354
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,399
one of the characteristics of these rats

355
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,180
was that they were used in a specific

356
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,240
encryption key that was smothered 360

357
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,790
however we found out that this China

358
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,260
said ghost rat was using the same

359
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,230
cryptographic key we can see here China

360
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,240
said I don't know if it's clear but

361
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,670
that's the the stack string and you see

362
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,970
the our integrity goes right which is

363
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,220
using the same cryptographic key so when

364
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,709
we actually did more research on this we

365
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:54,010
actually found a report on from keyhole

366
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,920
360 or from some malware that have very

367
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,070
similar characteristics of metal in this

368
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:00,519
malware

369
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:03,040
instead of using advocator DLL use USB

370
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,779
Tendo DLL although when we reverse

371
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,550
engineered is the allow we saw that

372
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,680
equinox we had logic implemented that

373
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,540
you could operate as lpk DLL and

374
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,260
furthermore they actually when when when

375
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,459
they analyzed the traffic and all of

376
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:17,170
that we saw that they actually connected

377
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,680
to the sub domain from the 3 3 3 3 2 2 2

378
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,470
2 dark domain which is the domain that

379
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,779
microsoft sinkhole so there has

380
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:27,100
different artifacts that correlate an

381
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,470
overlap with meet also may be senator

382
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,170
Varian or whatnot but anyways I don't

383
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,120
know if it's clear here but these this

384
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,500
or this instance were also using the

385
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,820
more 360 cryptographic key also of this

386
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,000
this specific instance of of ghost rat

387
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,530
had a specific texture that we never

388
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,160
seen before

389
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,180
and this helped us to find out a serious

390
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,710
corpus based on of go stress that we're

391
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,210
actually utilizing this descriptive

392
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,880
graphic key and we can see that some of

393
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,370
them produced the same codebase others

394
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,120
do not

395
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,840
so this means that a data specific ghost

396
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,480
rat fork is not very exclusive for any

397
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,480
any Chinese any a specific threat actor

398
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,550
but it's it's only used or at least the

399
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,460
only singer utilized by Chinese trade

400
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,920
actors and we have seen the same use

401
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,600
case the same case with red leaves and

402
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,480
red list was to go was a a trillion that

403
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,300
was first implemented by apt ten but

404
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,310
then it was leaked and now we see that

405
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,390
the cyber crime occurred system is

406
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,890
utilizing them in their tool sets and

407
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,990
this is the same shield China said that

408
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,610
is utilized in a some red leaves variant

409
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:37,180
and then on an addition in the Kehoe 360

410
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,860
report about this we're little implant

411
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,450
these ghosts are actually communicated

412
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,210
via SMTP and a keyhole actually

413
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,940
intercept the some of the emails and we

414
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,220
can see that they had the same actual

415
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,040
logs from the intrusion script that I

416
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,370
was actually utilized and we we actually

417
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,400
look in our honeypot so it's crazy that

418
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,820
over the years they have no retooling

419
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,900
you know so this is some overview of the

420
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,119
findings so we have neato Genesis and I

421
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,030
wrote a graffiti among other groups

422
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,430
night all middle actually as we said

423
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,800
uses appliquéd at the 11th surf star we

424
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,740
said we seen advocated DLL being inside

425
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,339
DDoS toes hosted by China set we also

426
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,930
saw that mr. black the Windows version

427
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:29,230
shares growth with the certain the

428
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,030
original original or you know surf star

429
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,890
instance from little and then we saw

430
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,560
that the linux version of mr. black has

431
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,450
been hosted with some modified versions

432
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,000
of surf star and on the other side we

433
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,080
seen that a our entire day

434
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,769
a go strap fork that is using this motor

435
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:49,309
360 key is being shared among Nieto and

436
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:53,450
also China said so conclusions are that

437
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,669
some some share malware among these

438
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:57,499
groups is not known to be open source a

439
00:17:57,499 --> 00:17:59,480
Serb start and this suggests that these

440
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,009
artifacts are being exclusively share

441
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:04,269
within these cybercrime communities

442
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:07,129
adapted open-source malware shared and

443
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,899
adapted in this group seems to be based

444
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:10,759
on specific modified fork forks from

445
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,529
Chinese superstores malware like ghost

446
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:15,259
rat and red leaves some of these Forks

447
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:18,109
have been also have been seen adapted

448
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:20,480
also by a Chinese deputies this is the

449
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,440
iron tiger apt showcase and talk is tool

450
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,149
every DDoS attack seems to be quite old

451
00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:29,109
but still in in use and maintain and

452
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,609
seems that most of these groups is no

453
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:33,889
it's no it's not uncommon to see this

454
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:35,419
type of malware being hosted and being

455
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:37,669
drawn dropping some funny factor like

456
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:40,639
ramune torpor i tore one of these so we

457
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:43,039
can speculate on that and we can say we

458
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,720
can build the hypothesis that maybe days

459
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,139
these reactors are operating from a

460
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:50,299
compromised physical window service so

461
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:52,190
based on on these findings we can state

462
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,340
that the Chinese cyber crime we can

463
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,989
based on this find this we can state

464
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:58,249
that the Chinese are ground-based

465
00:18:58,249 --> 00:18:59,570
technical intelligence can lead to

466
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,399
attribution discrepancies due to the

467
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:03,409
high volume of share artifacts taking

468
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:07,190
place in in these communities well so

469
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,259
that's it if you have any questions

470
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:11,629
please ask if not that's all this is

471
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:15,090
well thanks

472
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,240
[Applause]
