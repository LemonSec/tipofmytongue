00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:04,879
good morning everybody welcome back to

2
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:10,139
BB 2019 final day first session I can

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,809
see the loads of people in the audience

4
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:21,570
anyway our welcome lang and Mooney what

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,210
seems to be a very promising technical

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,760
discussion on kernel or abilities so

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,599
please go ahead thank you

8
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,370
our topic is playfully mystery hunting

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,649
hours as McCoy's

10
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,750
Colonel Warren Beatty ultimately and

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,200
this multi umbrella and half hour four

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,739
years

13
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,489
security appearance and melody folks are

14
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:52,980
McCoys and ours one Beauty and malware

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,160
and now respond before the forum

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,210
projecting our team and this is money

17
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,540
his Mary Fox and Mike wells and mccoys

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,000
Android and ours vulnerability and Mary

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,310
folk song vulnerability hunting and

20
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:23,610
sample2 admin in our team this is the

21
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,729
agenda or our topic we were it for we

22
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,880
were introduced our static analysis for

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,220
connotations attached interfaces and

24
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,290
analyzed its shortage and gives us

25
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,930
solution then we will introduce our in

26
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,229
has to pass a file solution and study

27
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,380
one case which we have found before

28
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,549
funny we were given a conclusion now I

29
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,040
will introduce the study analysis for

30
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,130
connotation first in it men includes

31
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,600
four steps we first unknown Charles and

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,930
get all classes inheritance relationship

33
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:11,700
then refine the method name by sounding

34
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,050
her

35
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,190
mechanism suddenly we were automatically

36
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,280
analyse euro euro coins in each station

37
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,070
and their connection hi finally we are

38
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,220
local the Jessel or the external

39
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,290
missiles for each Hilda current and past

40
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,660
them based on the data structure in the

41
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,670
outlet mechanism OS Americas many many

42
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,740
runtime runtime type information for Liv

43
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,980
Liv Connor and our kid Cassie's it is

44
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,310
called and it is caught and boundary

45
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,620
layer with four instead of three

46
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,200
parameters the first one contains

47
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,390
pointer to the metaclass which will be

48
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,810
constructed the second one is its name

49
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,750
the sadawa is is parent Marika's

50
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,270
instance and the first one is a site so

51
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,440
service function we can find all crises

52
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,600
in Hortons relationship and we know the

53
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,600
string symbol stripped in the release

54
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,860
women firmware so it should refine the

55
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,700
method names for each OS object class

56
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,030
including instant mess method table and

57
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,560
meta method level so the e in Horton

58
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,280
magnesia many method names can be

59
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,690
refined from his parents here is here is

60
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,830
an example we can see that our mobile

61
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:58,640
from buffer s important from our source

62
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:05,370
and for all the kind analysis the final

63
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,090
purpose is to get the connective

64
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,730
euro-crime map like the for example

65
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,299
given the assembly code snapped we

66
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,298
should oppose the mapping and the right

67
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,539
english or forgetting that we should

68
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:23,250
look here the new electronic function

69
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,630
jazz in each

70
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,150
each tower first then on either assembly

71
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,040
instructions to enumerate the connection

72
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,530
types as well and corresponding user

73
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:41,170
kind for organizational measures

74
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,810
we will first introduce the al-kidd

75
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,810
external missile called mechanism first

76
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,690
a system will check if towers all right

77
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,250
is no malfunction

78
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,170
if yes ignore the right part first

79
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,060
system will call it no matter in the

80
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,920
derived classes derived classes had to

81
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,990
implement measures when you seen things

82
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,480
don't measure despair table using

83
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,240
selector first and then using the super

84
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,520
external methyl function to complete the

85
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,450
method call the other is the incident

86
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,020
the right price implement all the

87
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,630
external measures call in the override

88
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,510
measure the differences than

89
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,670
connotations should respond before the

90
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:36,580
Eggman's check by themselves if

91
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,160
equations not authorized is known as a

92
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,150
function that should override these

93
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,580
functions X no function is no matter we

94
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,730
are query the method dispatch using this

95
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:56,040
function and then continues a methyl car

96
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,680
for for those implementations which

97
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,940
finish which equations not all right

98
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,670
external methyl function or overrides

99
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,140
the external methyl function parts

100
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,420
geocoding super external methyl function

101
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,230
we call them graceful in implementation

102
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,430
because in these two types of

103
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,930
implementations exceptions we are

104
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,160
defined a local or global constant

105
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,640
especially these two fingers shows the

106
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,690
implementation of our hid driver here we

107
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,720
can see this function using selector to

108
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,090
index the as Messrs

109
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,270
this is the definition of s Messrs is a

110
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:48,130
global concern array this finger shows

111
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,640
the economists re-inker target and the

112
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,410
message for index function our old IQ

113
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:01,840
seekers is a local can story consistent

114
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,720
consumers are saved in symbol table

115
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,650
section so for those two graceful

116
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,170
implementations we can first relocate

117
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,960
the study address in symbol in symbol

118
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,950
table and then pass the content

119
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,020
according to the data structure was more

120
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:25,510
constants in both Urist always - - and -

121
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,280
desicion

122
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,550
such as certain reasonable so our frame

123
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,480
buffer Gillick ran and hid user kind in

124
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,940
the finger below for the ended for the

125
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,370
implementation which drawers overwrite

126
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,080
the external missile function and

127
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,020
country is a function method call by the

128
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,580
old we can quite ugly implantation

129
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,280
because this kinda hours early use is

130
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,190
closed or switch code to ensure external

131
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,670
external my so called according to

132
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,670
different selector 40s we also look at

133
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,460
the dresser alright x enormous a

134
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,330
function first and then online assembly

135
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,590
instructions to get the specters and

136
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,600
corresponding measures here is an

137
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,820
example using switch clause

138
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,070
different from the different from the

139
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:26,170
standard C++ eppley the jump table for

140
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,880
each each force which case closed so it

141
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,159
will helpful for us to online different

142
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:39,130
just lecture selector path for assembly

143
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:44,159
instruction analysis we customize an

144
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,600
extension analysis agent and

145
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,529
structions emulator what's more we use

146
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:56,370
museum to generate C F G and guys

147
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,370
instruction emulator to analyze the

148
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,699
critical path eventually it can help us

149
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:06,560
to general attack so his automatic

150
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,490
here's our implementation the first

151
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,600
three functions are used to search the

152
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,139
water and film address for each segment

153
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:23,399
dissection and the next force functions

154
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,100
are used to get memory content or stream

155
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,790
for given class the for the four into

156
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,160
functions yield to transfer for water

157
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,850
address and the film address this class

158
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,089
is refundable for map Metro into class

159
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,040
and pass all the sections from

160
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,209
information in order to pry the passing

161
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:52,589
information last we defined the OS

162
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:56,120
miracles that until to sell all the

163
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,569
details information which when online

164
00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:02,610
each Hilda kind and there is no external

165
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,959
measures here we can find the details

166
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,800
information including first name address

167
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,139
of many key functions and whether it can

168
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:16,350
be connect connects Romulus best and

169
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,240
given its connection tie with years

170
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,630
this is Costner from average height the

171
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,680
HD aging New York I function rod finger

172
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,310
is the safe key generate by Mesa we can

173
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,040
see that it has three connection types

174
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,550
including 0 to 3 and as mentioned before

175
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,610
we only care about the certain registers

176
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:50,639
data flow in list example is 14 tier

177
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,509
adjuster actually this mystery killer is

178
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:56,550
point to the connection time register

179
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,000
which is the first parameter or noodle

180
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,920
occurrence

181
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,120
for examiner is the same after getting

182
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,930
this branching you CFG and all we need

183
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:13,360
to do is to analyze online them together

184
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,040
related user client information or

185
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,450
external message information here we

186
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,330
list some instructionally immolated such

187
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:31,810
as adi p/n platform an area no call for

188
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:38,960
x64 transform these two pictures show

189
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,570
some register operation English

190
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:45,260
immolation such as get immediately when

191
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,870
will offset register name from

192
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:52,850
instructions passed on our to resist our

193
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,810
output here you may find it only

194
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:00,140
contains the two connection types but it

195
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,950
actually how sorry we mentioned before

196
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:09,010
this is a shortage of static on analysis

197
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,110
the influence are mainly because most

198
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,750
extensions are closed and the message

199
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,000
stream is a styptic mower C+ C++

200
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,190
language or reuse object pointer paths

201
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:27,140
also to call function so this objects

202
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,460
may lead to miss here we recommend using

203
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,360
our DB D bar to help us

204
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,400
next we are and money to money will

205
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:50,180
introduce the foreign parts okay

206
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,430
as we have mentioned before the Kim

207
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,070
authority but then for dynamic analysis

208
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,870
to Canter's the runtime contest to

209
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,750
attack interface API so to have a

210
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,120
checkered past or even reproduce the

211
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,550
potential what ability as our best

212
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,750
practice we would like to Frida to

213
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,370
control and it treats the yuta mode

214
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,480
contest and the D please

215
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,880
to our DB debugger to trace the kernel

216
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,400
counterpart the table above is our

217
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,910
pretty good comparison summary among

218
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,750
difference

219
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,060
typically dynamic countries according to

220
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,610
different dimensions as in the Yuta

221
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,860
MODOK the freedom may be one of us a

222
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,190
most popular dynamic DB I took it for

223
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,280
money platform including Mac OS and ours

224
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,310
one of the crew at one he decided allow

225
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,740
you to pick and control every function

226
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,440
using the well documented and charts

227
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,590
good API including the pre and post even

228
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,530
handling typically we will retrieve the

229
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,140
random information including the code

230
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,150
tag back trees throughout the contest

231
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,670
and the return value and a theorem the

232
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,730
information you defined as show in

233
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,390
spectrum so yellow one is subtract with

234
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:14,430
you can define by yourself under the

235
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,000
green fretted row in interacted with the

236
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,780
route or

237
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,070
a high privilege into the target for

238
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,900
example so my quattro base and the other

239
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,920
kind of processes and the in the red

240
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,530
part is the freighter controller which

241
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,370
is connected by the USB or network

242
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,200
connection to control the fray the

243
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,770
server and about the father

244
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:45,140
LGBT Kron debugging we can see Satan

245
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,350
howdy

246
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,460
LGBT bank mechanism has increased has

247
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,200
integrated along era since the creation

248
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,470
of a Mac OS early composer was simple

249
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,020
agent running inside the kernel which

250
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,940
receive and the executor debug will

251
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,050
command and complete completely debug

252
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:04,980
debugger

253
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,770
running on the remote machine which send

254
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,510
the commands to the kernel and it

255
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,500
displays the results and for the more

256
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,570
utility and power of kernel debugging

257
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,720
Apple has also published I did develop

258
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,980
developer related kernel debugging heat

259
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,140
which contains the release

260
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,660
and the key song and the development to

261
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,240
or debug the beauty of the kernel this

262
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,380
is this hides the part to show the

263
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,120
symbols are the internal symbols of

264
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,700
other developer to see the internal of

265
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,060
the Macross so the symbols and it's

266
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,300
bugging information in the waffle format

267
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,230
for each of the corrodium is integrated

268
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,200
to the iple kernel detention and there's

269
00:15:52,200 --> 00:16:00,149
a kernel yourself an author some echo as

270
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:04,860
a release is API wrapper for the bit our

271
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,980
DB debug the baggage grieving breathing

272
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,269
API and appended kind of for plug-in you

273
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:15,470
can define your own plugins to control

274
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:20,420
the target at all as you want

275
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:23,630
well here is the brief comparison

276
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,750
comparison of interception method which

277
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,019
could explain why we choose debugger be

278
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,699
simple and speaking do trees and afraid

279
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:35,370
our debugger are also greeted with the

280
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,519
programming section treating with

281
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,579
well-documented the API and good freedom

282
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:44,579
Jorge peer instruction level however we

283
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,399
did cut the trees for his disability to

284
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,680
modify the extraction column under the

285
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,380
data at runtime Fred I saw best the user

286
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,079
mode interception way but not at kernel

287
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:58,529
modem so as for the line hook is good

288
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:00,620
for the instruction level control but

289
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,049
operation is a birth drawback inside is

290
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:08,640
too raw to take much a drop a much

291
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,599
obvious too much development effort to

292
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,079
utility so infrastructure and crowd

293
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,280
platform resurrection comparing our DB

294
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,220
debugger

295
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,380
ok and the other indeed Prada we will

296
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,990
introduce our enhance the patty were

297
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,480
fighting methodology

298
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,690
didja the hope you drove our passive

299
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,809
fast solutions to us as the microkernel

300
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,020
interface as we as the key methodology

301
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,159
for fuzzing we would like to touch more

302
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:48,809
exaction path or code courage as

303
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:51,240
possible and the catch is the first part

304
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,669
of the kernel crash our fighting details

305
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:58,470
our design for implementation

306
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,630
so the key step is to fathom is try to

307
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,190
generate the fruit a book or proceed

308
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,870
about the kernel interface API that

309
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,909
tries to so graphic driver and chef kind

310
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:11,279
of interface and account to the kernel

311
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:13,429
from the user mode agent

312
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:16,320
besides the blind advising such as the

313
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,539
Trinity like or since color we

314
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:21,960
recommended to utilize the normal

315
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,299
program which have more chances to

316
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:28,049
interact with the kernel for example the

317
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:30,750
OpenGL or the graphic driver and the 3d

318
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:36,000
mentioned games and it is the second

319
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,950
level the pensive driver would try to

320
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,529
intercept the typical API such as the

321
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:42,570
economical method from the kernel mode

322
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,600
to the user mode which is a pretty good

323
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,539
channel to control the drower and by

324
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,880
parting the input driver of the API

325
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,419
parameters such as the scalar signaling

326
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,270
binder and all our environment and the

327
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,789
other kind of imply Barbara we can try

328
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:03,870
to tint the into the driver at in the

329
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,870
route or data which is directive control

330
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,720
device the user mode the data and also

331
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,429
we have integrators of the kernels that

332
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:13,440
write a mechanism such as the kisser and

333
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,100
the Khronos cannot resign rider which is

334
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,470
useful to improve the fighting quality

335
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,200
and the quantity which we sought is the

336
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,870
sunrise Mackenzie the crash caused by

337
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,409
the memory corruption or ability maybe

338
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:31,559
handle them miss dismissed about kernel

339
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:36,059
code itself what's more it Sarah would

340
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,429
existing instruction sequences disorder

341
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:40,890
between the root cause the point and is

342
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,920
the final instruction pointer

343
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,700
of the crash and although we would try

344
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,590
to monitor this the tagging machine by

345
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,610
the ODB mechanism and try to reboot Soho

346
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:01,700
target why it's our crashed our Honda I

347
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,250
suppose a kiss on mechanism is one of

348
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,980
the compel the feature is active as a

349
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,640
new kernel you can simply in integrated

350
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,130
this commander Mik ethically route with

351
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:22,440
and the kernel control fix here and to

352
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,780
enable if candle for kernels and riser

353
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:30,840
mechanism I thought a cracker monitor

354
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,830
this module is tried to separate them

355
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,880
independently from the target machine

356
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,090
two monitors Takeda machine kernel panic

357
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,300
called Bell fatty and called and try to

358
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,520
collect natural creature material from

359
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,740
foreign production and the rebooted

360
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,260
tagging a machine for raw and raw egg in

361
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,350
here above here below is the crash issue

362
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,180
generated automatically by the crash

363
00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:04,680
monitor to be frank algae bt bug Oh

364
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,100
patty debug belong to the passive for

365
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,690
fast so in order to touch more deaths of

366
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,960
the target attack attack surface so

367
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,640
following mechanism could it be very

368
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,440
effective because if you can generate

369
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,440
multiple properties from normal covers

370
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,390
in the form of the user mode saying you

371
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:32,100
can you have a more chance of crash one

372
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,770
bit we're treated to create the kernel

373
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,800
so we suggested you to for example

374
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,800
render 3d game either euthimal space as

375
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,950
much as possible and run the benchmark

376
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,490
program into the most with such as GFX

377
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,550
benchmark or axe benchmark and also you

378
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,010
can run active of us to interview to

379
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:56,970
model to generate more properties these

380
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:57,900
methods can

381
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,650
make us a really render function calling

382
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:05,280
mall sequence mall frequentist and euro

383
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,380
which habit we improve the fighting

384
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,940
efficiency as an implementation we have

385
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,059
integrated iPods grouped to control our

386
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:18,840
fatty agent in suit modem this iPod

387
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,210
script that has integrated the fruit of

388
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,610
API to control your target the four

389
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:27,360
examples a safari browser and the open

390
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,570
and the close and the manual control of

391
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:35,400
the application to buy the kind of mimic

392
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,150
of the user active user interaction you

393
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:42,809
can generate long normal corpus of data

394
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:46,220
stream to the user to the kernel mode

395
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,230
here are some tricks to generate enough

396
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,020
normal data and the fast to keep the

397
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,940
hosted from always working you know what

398
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,790
as in practice the for example in case

399
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,490
of this Mohonk we have integrated the

400
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:04,050
kernel reboot and we have loaded our own

401
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:08,400
kata murderer into the kernel and even

402
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,090
the whole serum is hung and there is no

403
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:15,660
response in the user mode agent so we

404
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,270
can't Emily reboot is a host determine

405
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,490
from the kernel driver and we have

406
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:23,370
integrated tool kind of undock who and

407
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:30,840
doctrine the API to reboot the kernel in

408
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,790
the other part we will introduce and so

409
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,809
one ability we have found by the by our

410
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:38,730
power fighting with files new machine

411
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,809
and by the interface color really and

412
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:46,740
this is the year 2008 and the 44 signal

413
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,429
to this is kind of for integral of lower

414
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:56,100
ability which can which is crash there

415
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,240
in AMD frame frame frame perfect' rarer

416
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,800
and it is the rod cause back when the

417
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,710
vulnerability is is fine

418
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,470
we can see is that we can see that the

419
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,010
back trees of the crowd point the yaks

420
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,320
get a pixel information method that is

421
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,600
one of Io frame powerful news clients a

422
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,810
method and this is the lecture also

423
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,390
command control is one and it's a matter

424
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,610
that tickets tickets race the gurney

425
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:32,040
scalar input data which are which are

426
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:37,380
relevant for teeth plamodo deaths and

427
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,660
aperture and retains a particular pixel

428
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,670
information in the end and this is the

429
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:49,750
root cause of the world one ability we

430
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:56,800
can see that this insert a key the

431
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,890
function this parameter is firstly

432
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:05,320
checked to compare rates of 10 and and

433
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,000
indeed Parton

434
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,110
it well it well we will try to move this

435
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,150
value which is controlled them by the

436
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,570
you know more them to are di and the

437
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,180
what ability point is here it will it

438
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,170
will be wrong attendance so unsigned I

439
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:27,520
find the integral 264 piece so it

440
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,840
becomes with this kind of value which is

441
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,710
which the print values at FFF

442
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:42,150
so did kind of value is so big so did

443
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,950
when we call to did kind of information

444
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:50,610
will come to some or ob1 ability

445
00:25:53,630 --> 00:26:00,830
oh okay this is our conclusion on the

446
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,390
first way we introduced the method

447
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,940
methodology to analysis attacked

448
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,010
interface of the chronic attention by

449
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,380
aesthetically analysis understand we

450
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,380
will introduce her hands the petty

451
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,780
fuzzing architecture in the Mac OS

452
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,170
system to us the kernel itself and the

453
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,630
dread attention and finally we will

454
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,750
study so our ability we have fun about

455
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,380
fighting and couldn't revealing okay

456
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:32,020
these are our final slice thank you
