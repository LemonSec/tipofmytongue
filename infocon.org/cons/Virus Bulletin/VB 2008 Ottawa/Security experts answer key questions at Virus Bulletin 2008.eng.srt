1
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,480
and a versus not dead as far as he's

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,230
dead actually no but it's slowly

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,869
pondering - it's deep I don't think it's

4
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:18,340
dead it's gonna be merging with other

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,470
technologies like detection technology

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,420
something

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,529
it's no more dead than the global

8
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:27,099
financial system antivirus will be dead

9
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:28,919
once I get through with them

10
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:32,619
Microsoft issue to come up with new

11
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,150
security homes and keep us in business

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,410
for a long long time

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,870
- virus obviously is going to be around

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,300
for a long time I think I remember when

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,620
I first came into the industry that was

16
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,210
what I was told antivirus is dead is

17
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,460
going away 1995 it's definitely been

18
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,949
killed we've we've nailed it into the

19
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:49,840
coffin that it was going away again and

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,989
about 2000 and every time we seem to

21
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:55,919
resurrect it someway

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,519
not even in my fridge

23
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,060
yes but maybe not we you'd expect that

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:23,159
what I've never put lipstick on a pig I

25
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,159
have put pigs on lipstick

26
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,869
you call me a pig no but I've tried

27
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:37,640
rubbing it off a time or two and it

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,780
doesn't work there's still pigs

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,819
[Music]

30
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,190
now you are a bit more festive I can't

31
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,619
just some simple technical question

32
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,729
revolting you should cut it off

33
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:01,310
immediately I actually think Miko is a

34
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,800
reincarnation of Legolas I'm not certain

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,600
what would happen if we cut off his tail

36
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,250
but I hope that his quiver is always

37
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,500
full he has had it as long as I have

38
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,450
known him so it's it's okay

39
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,209
vacuum very a ponytail it doesn't make

40
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:18,020
you look younger

41
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,600
ponytail doesn't make you look sexy it's

42
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,800
just disgusting

43
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,150
I do not comment on other people's

44
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,730
personal tastes and I constantly give

45
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,370
them fashion advice isn't it doesn't

46
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,709
follow I guess I suggest we cut it off

47
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:36,010
and find out oh god is gonna be edited

48
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,750
favorite power ballad they were a power

49
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,640
ballad you know that's a very difficult

50
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,080
question because there are numerous

51
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,160
pallet power ballads
