1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
hi everyone we took the opportunity at

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,200
the virus Britain conference or not

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,600
whatever few words with John from

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,320
the company well we're here in Ottawa

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,860
the capital of canada as you can see the

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,990
year Parliament Buildings just at just

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,850
outside there I want you for the virus

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,939
bulletin conference which is in some

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,350
teeth year now we could go for a long

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,279
long time it's a pretty slick and pretty

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,140
impressive show generally and I think

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,670
this year should be one of the good ones

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,960
as the is gone on we've grown grown when

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,680
fir we've added interesting new new

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,239
aspects this year for the second year

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,010
running we have a last-minute stream

17
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,020
obviously yeah most of our papers have

18
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,670
to be submitted quite far in advance to

19
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,470
give people time to get them prepared

20
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,239
properly but we also have an afternoon

21
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,879
of last-minute technical talks which

22
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,790
will be covering very very latest issues

23
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,050
which it should hopefully be pretty

24
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,769
interesting this year

25
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,559
way of course we don't just cover

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,220
viruses we cover the full range of

27
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,710
malware and other security threats we

28
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,440
have a special spam stream with top spam

29
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,600
experts discussing the problems of that

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,670
field and and yeah we look at that

31
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,490
particular types of malware and at

32
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,160
methods of combating we have a selection

33
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,800
of last minute technical talks I'm

34
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,060
actually going to be giving one myself

35
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,670
on some some of the new testing plans

36
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,990
that we have in place of virus bulletin

37
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,750
we've been running a trial in the last

38
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,030
few weeks and should have some pretty

39
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,140
interesting results I hope

40
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,049
there's a pretty wide range of people

41
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,149
attend the contract there the the police

42
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,009
may have the oversight bodies for

43
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,240
financial institutions and people like

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,860
that government they're all that they're

45
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,899
all here obviously the security experts

46
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,780
are the year the lifeblood of the

47
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,000
conference we do have top top experts

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,470
from from all across the industry from

49
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,360
all the big AV firms all the best labs

50
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,269
tend to send their best best people but

51
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:11,220
we also have pretty pretty strong

52
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,620
showing of the corporate side of people

53
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,560
we have CEOs and leaders of the big

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,019
security firms as well as firms outside

55
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:21,690
the industry but very very large

56
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,910
corporations that have significant

57
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,579
security interests to enter send both

58
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,030
their their security admins and also the

59
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,200
management side that need to know about

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,269
the latest threats and how they should

61
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:36,470
be combatted

62
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,470
I think the the whole anti AV is dead

63
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,300
topic it's been going for quite a number

64
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,819
of years now it's probably isn't going

65
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:51,540
to go away that it's it's a pretty easy

66
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,489
statement to make but it's it's pretty

67
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:57,390
hard to back up all these alternatives

68
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,930
the people are constantly proposing at

69
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,160
the same kind of alternatives that

70
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,410
people were putting forward 10-15 years

71
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,430
ago and AV is basically shown that it

72
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,049
it's it's very much required

73
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,340
the number of years ago we were in in

74
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,409
New Orleans when I was pretty pretty

75
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:22,500
nasty hurricane struck and more people

76
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,180
recently there was a conference in

77
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,480
Canada that was slightly cramped by a

78
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,569
sars up epidemic put a few people off

79
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:33,810
attending but the last few years have

80
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,069
been have been it's been pretty

81
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:36,540
problem-free they've been pretty slick

82
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,189
in pretty smooth and generally enjoyed

83
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:40,400
by all

84
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:45,260
if I had to set up the conference in a

85
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,790
single word unmissable
