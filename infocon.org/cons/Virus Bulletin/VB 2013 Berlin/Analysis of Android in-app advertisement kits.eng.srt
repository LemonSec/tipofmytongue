1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,879
ladies and gentlemen sorry for running a

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,930
bit late but that happens so I'm help me

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,429
in welcoming Excel of real for hopefully

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:23,910
a very interesting presentation sound

5
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:34,649
some should be hear me now right and is

6
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:40,260
it better there yeah fine okay um so I'm

7
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,910
going to present some work I did

8
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,370
research work I did with a colleague of

9
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,570
mine kyrene she's not here today so I'll

10
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,430
be doing the presentation here so it's

11
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:01,890
all about androids advertisement kits so

12
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,799
basically what happens is that you've

13
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,830
got three different actors advertisers

14
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,939
ad providers and publishers right it's

15
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,590
very basic but just that we get the

16
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,170
terms right so advertisers are the

17
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,710
brands they've got some ads that they

18
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,049
want to disseminate and they're going to

19
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,500
pay the ad providers to disseminate that

20
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,280
ad and then the ad providers are going

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,900
to pay publishers so that they display

22
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,920
the ad somewhere on the mobile phone so

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,140
the publishers can be athletes they can

24
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,110
be also I don't know dev vlog through

25
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,090
with his application and he thats

26
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,590
developer accepts to show the ad in his

27
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,320
application something like that and of

28
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,790
course in the end the advertisement gets

29
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,549
on the on the mobile phone of the end

30
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,560
user so that was for the vote cattle

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,990
reports now what are we going to learn

32
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,270
what hopefully we're going to learn in

33
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,300
this presentation but first it's that

34
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,500
will add provider

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,020
have been building a huge meter data

36
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,400
database okay and that's they are able

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,480
to correlate the data so maybe that

38
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,600
kinds of rings a bell towards I don't

39
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,180
know prism or what the NSA has been

40
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,850
doing to the other fact that we're going

41
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,520
to learn here is that advocates

42
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,709
obviously want to hide their behavior

43
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:42,690
they don't want us to know what they are

44
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,370
doing and also that's by the way they

45
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,300
are implementing their SDKs well in

46
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,190
several ways they are putting our phones

47
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,670
at risk in two different ways actually

48
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,160
they're actually exposing some security

49
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,520
holes in our mobile phones that's one

50
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,760
part of it but also from a privacy angle

51
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,300
well there are several times when we see

52
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,970
obviously that they are being careless

53
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,820
with our data so this is how we

54
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,959
conducted our research as we're an

55
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,330
antivirus company it's easy we've got a

56
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,290
large database of malware and so we just

57
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,080
took parts of that state abase it's

58
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,560
already 120,000 samples that's we we

59
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,769
started to do our research on from those

60
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:43,620
we only took those which were using in

61
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,519
that kit then we kind of classified and

62
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,519
all the ad kits that were being used and

63
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,040
then that's the big part of the research

64
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,100
well we reversed each of those advocates

65
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,940
that's 60 ad kits that we reversed to

66
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:08,150
inspect the code so in my research here

67
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,220
it's very much about what we found in

68
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,549
the code what we so they were doing and

69
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:17,160
not only I don't know a permission they

70
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,519
are asking eventually using or not okay

71
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,620
it's really what we see they are doing

72
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,720
in the code it's quite an important

73
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,870
point

74
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,180
so what are they collecting well i think

75
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,250
that the obvious ones you think of is

76
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,460
your country the gender th right there

77
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,590
are also plenty of course of sensitive

78
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,950
information they're collecting political

79
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,620
views sexual orientation marital status

80
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,360
religion can be quite sensitive

81
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,320
depending on the country facebook ID gps

82
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,390
coordinates if you've got children or

83
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:03,520
not your income search keywords and

84
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,210
you've got still many more IP address

85
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,260
email addresses all those i'm not going

86
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,830
to go all through of them all those all

87
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,360
those and all those okay so that's in

88
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,630
the 60 ad kids that we reversed we found

89
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,090
over 50 fields that they were collecting

90
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:31,300
50 so where are they getting the

91
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,900
information from their first obvious

92
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,480
source is the people themselves of

93
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,260
course so people willingly give

94
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,660
information to the through the ad kits

95
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,410
but what's important to note is that

96
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,870
they are giving it in a given context

97
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,690
and usually they're not exactly fully

98
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,180
aware that it's going to be reused in

99
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,140
another context say for instance I have

100
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,440
a medical app on my android mobile phone

101
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,560
well I'm going to give that application

102
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,380
my birthdate I don't know plenty of

103
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,110
medical information where I live if I'm

104
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,480
smoking if I'm not smoking that kind of

105
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,260
stuff all that kind of stuff will be

106
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,169
sometime collected by the ad kids it's

107
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:21,880
all it's all right that we gave it for a

108
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,980
medical appt but we won't expect it's

109
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,020
either now in another app such as I

110
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,800
don't know library application to have

111
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,800
that information and unfortunately it's

112
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,539
not that way that it happens we see that

113
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,800
advocates are collecting

114
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,020
making our building your user profile

115
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,610
for people they are correlated

116
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,819
correlating data that they get from

117
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:49,280
various applications and combining it to

118
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,580
to see as much as possible what our

119
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,099
habits what we like what we do what

120
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:57,050
we're what we're going to do when all

121
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,379
that kind of stuff so we demonstrated

122
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:06,229
that what we did is that we we built two

123
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:09,379
very very simple applications foo and

124
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:13,819
bar very nice names and we put it on we

125
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:16,370
put those on the same mobile phone those

126
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,159
two applications we're using the same at

127
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:24,379
kit SDK and foo ascending I'm age 15 and

128
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:29,719
15 okay right the ad kit gets the

129
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:33,169
information and the application bar is

130
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:36,219
just sending that I'm located in France

131
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:39,740
note that bar which is on the same

132
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,990
mobile phone is not supposed to know

133
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,650
that I'm age 15 but what we see is that

134
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,590
the etiquettes servers are serving an ad

135
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:54,919
about the French game now let's suppose

136
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:59,150
I say this time I'm 70 well what happens

137
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,940
is that the Advocate service provides an

138
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,659
ad about a golf resort so what we see

139
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,810
here is that obviously bar was not

140
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,169
supposed to know my age well is getting

141
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:15,139
different ads depending on what age I

142
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:18,020
say I have and on another application so

143
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,729
it really proves that the data is being

144
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:25,840
car related on the Advocate service and

145
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,849
this is just a screenshot of what we got

146
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:31,219
in one of our applications so you see

147
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,370
it's um a French game rude removal is

148
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,169
French game in French

149
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,349
so that was the first source of

150
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:47,000
information people now the second source

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,829
of information if people are not

152
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:51,579
willingly giving out some information

153
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:55,570
well it's to get the information kind of

154
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,769
unwillingly without some explicit

155
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:02,480
consents to do that there's at least two

156
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,779
different tricks one of those is to use

157
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:09,290
our and explicit permissions on on

158
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,579
Android for instance we've got the read

159
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:17,089
phone state permission on androids and

160
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,459
the documentation for that one says

161
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:24,250
allows read only access to phone state

162
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,910
well well is that really explicit for an

163
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,149
end user that it means that we will be

164
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:34,390
able to retrieve your phone number I

165
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:39,440
don't think it is okay so that's one way

166
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,620
to get some information without really

167
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,529
saying you're getting that one the other

168
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:49,190
way is of course well that you can just

169
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,440
get some a lot of information without

170
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,399
having exactly to request for a specific

171
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,459
permission for instance we noted that

172
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:03,140
mop click was I was trying to see if it

173
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,540
was running on a rooted device or not

174
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,880
there's no Android permission for that

175
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,589
so they just scan on the device in that

176
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:15,290
particular case look for the su

177
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,480
executable and see if it's there and

178
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,240
then they guess whether the device is

179
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,290
rooted or not and above all of course

180
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,180
the information was sent in clear text

181
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,490
to the advocate servers would it be fun

182
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:36,320
without that some other kind of amusing

183
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,930
examples that we saw with while

184
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,010
reversing the code is the level of

185
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,800
details of the fields they are

186
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,970
collecting so in millenia media for

187
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,440
instance well they're collecting the

188
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,730
marital status

189
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,760
and they there's a big large case with

190
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,339
where you have 10 if you're single if

191
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:00,350
you're married if you're divorced we

192
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,240
kind of expected those for a marital

193
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,079
status but swinger is really kind of

194
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,990
really more surprising and of course

195
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,880
it's sent in care text in the code of

196
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,089
quattro wireless well we see that

197
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:19,370
they're making a lot of categories for

198
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,370
the the ages of people so you've got

199
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,769
plenty of different categories for young

200
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:30,110
ones 12 17 18 24 but then bad luck if

201
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,040
you're over 55 well 55 or 80 it's just

202
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,310
the same for them that's an amusing fact

203
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,449
now this one I'm pretty sure you were

204
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:47,300
expecting that one of course a lot of

205
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,610
advocates are getting our GPS

206
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,970
coordinates approximately fifty percent

207
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,180
are getting that what you perhaps did

208
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,000
not expect is that they are still a lot

209
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,139
of them are sending it in clear text and

210
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,639
actually in the 60 ad kids that we

211
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,600
reversed only one in 60 he had the good

212
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,860
idea of using HTTPS to send GPS

213
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:18,380
coordinates only one google ad they try

214
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,680
to actually encrypt our gps coordinates

215
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,920
which is a nice attempt they are using

216
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,420
AES to to encrypt it but then when we

217
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,220
have a close look the code that is and

218
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,959
the lower part of it well we see that

219
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:40,519
the key is hard-coded and fixed so once

220
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:43,790
you have reversed the code once well you

221
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,250
get the key for all the to decrypt all

222
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,319
the GPS coordinates of everybody who's

223
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:52,399
using that specific google ad version so

224
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,040
it's kind of a little bit useless isn't

225
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,310
it code obfuscation I told you well

226
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,230
they're trying to hide what they're

227
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,680
doing well kind of forty percent of the

228
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,649
are using some form some level of code

229
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:12,620
obfuscation really depends on which had

230
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,779
kids what exactly how they're doing it

231
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:17,529
but we've even seen airpush for instance

232
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:20,500
obfuscating its own name that's really

233
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,120
strange kind of so they're not cold

234
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,790
always calm air push sometimes you see

235
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,899
it calm dot k lyv and it's something

236
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:34,250
like that now of course using

237
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,120
obfuscation is not very handsome or what

238
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,160
is we're principal of a reprehensible of

239
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,560
course is doing something wrong and

240
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,050
hiding it when we see in another ad kits

241
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,540
in the code that's there are for

242
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,610
instance trying to delete blogs the

243
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,310
system logs that is in mudlick agents

244
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,399
it's kind of a bit too too much I think

245
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,470
come on system logs you're not supposed

246
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,190
to be deleting them or we see some other

247
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,820
athletes such as pontiff Lex who is

248
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,990
using actively reflection to to hide the

249
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,110
fact that its retrieving email addresses

250
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,339
email addresses so yet java reflection

251
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:21,020
is kind of a technique well you're

252
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,900
you'll get the class you'll list all the

253
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,520
methods in the class and you're invoke

254
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,770
particular method in the class there so

255
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,459
it's kind of an indirect way of calling

256
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:38,779
calling a different a given method so

257
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:40,910
that's the example then you've got on

258
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,520
the upper part exactly what we find in

259
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,959
the code of Ponte flex and on the lower

260
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:52,850
parts of the slide it's the usual direct

261
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,120
way people would get your operational

262
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,110
email it's really simple it would be two

263
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,930
lines of codes writing getting the

264
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,870
account manager and then getting the the

265
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,500
accounts from that now it seems that

266
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,079
well operational emails of course are

267
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,510
very worthy to you the add kids because

268
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,300
it's an email that will be reading

269
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,760
actively that they are sure that will be

270
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,320
things like that so they really liked

271
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,800
you to know to see that probably and

272
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,660
pontiff legs well doesn't want us to

273
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,160
know its retrieving or email address and

274
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,240
is using the kind of indirect way of

275
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,230
getting it through a very lengthy java

276
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,410
reflection to get to get that the same

277
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:49,010
exactly information we've also noticed a

278
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,160
bunch of strange things that we see in

279
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,130
the sdk where i'm not exactly sure if

280
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,490
it's really malicious or not it's kind

281
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,450
of really borderline perhaps for

282
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,370
instance plenty of them plenty of the

283
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,360
SDKs are detecting if they are running

284
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,090
on the Android emulator or not that's

285
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,430
pretty easy to do that on in the code

286
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,950
because you can't ask for instance if I

287
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,700
don't know de mei is to a fixed given

288
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,560
value which is always on the Android

289
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,860
emulator or fits on the real handsets

290
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,160
it'll be another value of course so that

291
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,700
could be used because ad kits wants I

292
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,790
think it's absolutely useless to send an

293
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,130
ad to an android emulator that's one

294
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,730
possible reason the other way of seeing

295
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,550
the thing is that they don't want an

296
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,250
anti-virus analyst or other analysts you

297
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,230
have a look at what's inside the code

298
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,580
and so the they are behaving a different

299
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,120
way on an android emulator the other

300
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,580
thing that we so which i am not sure of

301
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,400
is well why are they are detecting if

302
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,280
the device is rooted or not we see that

303
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,020
and mob takes kind of strange and then

304
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,910
finally of course there are few

305
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,829
dangerous behaviors that we see

306
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:17,599
occasionally in app loving that's one

307
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,300
case that we noted in the code we see

308
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,359
that it is getting a file then it's

309
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,970
calling one of its own classes which is

310
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,680
s called sdk class loader and that one

311
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,830
inherits from dex class loader

312
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:38,000
now Dex classloader I guess it's a

313
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,440
pretty well-known from Android

314
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,500
developers because that class enables

315
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,100
people to load dalvik executables

316
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,760
without actually triggering the normal

317
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,399
and style so it means that you'll be

318
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:55,940
loading some external code you'll be

319
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,590
loading it on the mobile phone

320
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,870
installing it and the end user won't be

321
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,919
seeing anything at all now this is

322
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,880
really exposing a security hole because

323
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,399
what happens if if the ad kit server

324
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:17,840
gets compromised does that mean that

325
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,570
it's gone it could be serving I don't

326
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,639
know not where to all the mobile phones

327
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:24,919
and the mobile phones who have that ad

328
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:27,559
kids are gonna install the malware and

329
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:35,539
won't see anything at all now don't get

330
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:37,279
excited I've got plenty of conclusions

331
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:39,710
out this is not the last slide but I

332
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,130
noticed that a lot of people just love

333
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,960
stats so I thought I should exclude

334
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,580
include a slight lead about stats so one

335
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,669
malware and 3 contains advocates one and

336
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:56,600
two uses GPS coordinates one in to

337
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,080
retrieve your Android ID less than

338
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,360
twenty percent care to hash or encrypts

339
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,630
identifiers one I mean auntie fires such

340
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:12,740
as imei imsi the uuid that kind of stuff

341
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,010
and they've been seen to collect over 50

342
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,590
fields and forty percent of them are

343
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:24,919
using obfuscation recently actually

344
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:27,320
you've been to a conference with richard

345
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,080
stallman of the Free Software Foundation

346
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,330
and you know the term of free is really

347
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,909
a term that the word that they like very

348
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:40,070
much and they always say is it free as

349
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,340
in beer or free as in speech so I

350
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,610
wondered what's the case for at kids

351
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,389
well as a matter

352
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:50,929
fat it's not free it's not free in

353
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:54,079
either cases though it's not free as in

354
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:56,690
beer because what happens is that

355
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,869
although sometimes the application is

356
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:02,899
free you still pay for the cost of the

357
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:05,659
data flow if your subscription does not

358
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:08,029
include that well you'll be playing for

359
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:10,070
all the ads that are getting to your

360
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,200
mobile phone also you've got all the

361
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,579
energy which is consumed for that well

362
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:18,619
there's been a research on that and

363
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,599
actually sixty-five percent of the

364
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:23,869
energy which is consumed in gaming apps

365
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:28,729
is for ads sixty-five percent and then

366
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,829
of course you've got also you pay in

367
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,419
another way it's the indirect

368
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:34,729
consumption if you're seeing all day

369
00:20:34,729 --> 00:20:38,239
long an advertisement by oranges you'll

370
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:40,459
end up buying oranges I've got nothing

371
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:45,559
against oranges though and well is it

372
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:48,279
free as in speech well no of course not

373
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,659
because there's a terrible loss of

374
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:58,029
privacy in that case now for the dangers

375
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:01,339
what dangers are really are really

376
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:05,209
facing to with mobile ads well when i

377
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:07,369
submitted this paper actually all the

378
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:11,299
stuff about prism and the NSA and X key

379
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:14,119
go and score it etc hadn't been released

380
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,909
so it kind of sheds a new lights on to

381
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:19,459
that but on our mobile phone of course

382
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:21,769
we've got plenty of personal data we've

383
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:23,450
got a camera we've got a microphone

384
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:27,169
we've got GPS plenty of data now suppose

385
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:29,450
and I think that happens fairly often

386
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:33,249
that an ad server is located in the US

387
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:36,739
well could the NSA with a Patrick

388
00:21:36,739 --> 00:21:39,979
attacks requests from the ad servers or

389
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:46,279
user profile John Doe age 32 etc or what

390
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:49,309
happens also if summer criminal gets

391
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:53,329
success to those records and uses it for

392
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:56,719
whatever some targeted spearfishing and

393
00:21:56,719 --> 00:22:00,220
submission whatever or are the case

394
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,549
if the cybercriminal compromises the ads

395
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:07,320
servers and the ad server starts kind of

396
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,210
contaminating infecting all the mobile

397
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,080
phones with some malware those are very

398
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,990
possible scenarios so are they bad or

399
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:25,260
advertisements bad my opinion is that

400
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,250
untargeted advertisements are okay right

401
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,740
that is the good part of it now targeted

402
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,860
ads are kind of getting really more

403
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,830
borderline there are some targeted ads

404
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,799
that we could perhaps except for

405
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:43,480
instance on a TV show when you're

406
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,789
watching I don't know a game of soccer

407
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:49,630
you'll have a lot of ads for men and

408
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,039
when it's a ballet you'll have a lot of

409
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,360
ads for female okay so this is some kind

410
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,750
of targeted ad seems pretty reasonable

411
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,350
though but with mobile ads we're really

412
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,020
going one step further because they have

413
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,929
a lot of our personal data there and I

414
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:13,780
think this is an issue so well I'm an

415
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,179
antivirus analyst so of course it rings

416
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:19,570
a bell very strongly for me where do i

417
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,580
set the limit where's the limit between

418
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,370
something which is entirely clean should

419
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,470
i detect it as an ad where should i

420
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,590
detect it as a malware what should i do

421
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:34,120
when i see such samples and also we're

422
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,070
kind of all of us when can we do about

423
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,840
the same because we're in front of

424
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,940
something which is kind of dangerous for

425
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,010
us and if there are there things other

426
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,070
things that we can do on the technical

427
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,510
point of view plenty of people have

428
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,039
already said that it would be a very

429
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:51,100
good idea to separate the permissions

430
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,220
between what the ad kids are requesting

431
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,130
and what the application is requested so

432
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,049
that would be a good technical step of

433
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:03,640
course there's plenty of them broder

434
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:10,559
ways to do to find solutions also is is

435
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,900
it possible to move to non targeted ads

436
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:19,480
or could we find a way to promote you

437
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,060
know Atlas apps because for now many

438
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,790
people developers in their garage they

439
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,010
send out the builds their application

440
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,320
and they just want some revenue when

441
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,030
they think ok I'm going to put some ad

442
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:35,440
in my in my app I'm not sure that is

443
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,770
that efficient if they have just a few

444
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:42,400
hundreds of downloads and the impact is

445
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,290
that we get ads everywhere um the last

446
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,900
one I'll do destructible data is just a

447
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,450
pure wish but I don't know think that

448
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,160
could happen what I would light at first

449
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,940
is that we put some data one day and

450
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,920
three days later you can never see it

451
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,200
again it has disappeared but of course

452
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,940
there's always somebody with a Wayback

453
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,960
Machine that fine again the data so

454
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,840
that's perhaps not feasible for now so

455
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,850
well anyway that that's plenty of ideas

456
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:19,690
that we've got something to do about it

457
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:22,510
and what we can do and that pretty much

458
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:26,980
concludes Maya I talk you've got the way

459
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,490
to contact me if you wish if we've got

460
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,800
time for question on ready to answer of

461
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,170
course right thank you very much do you

462
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:38,070
have any questions

463
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,370
any questions from the audience of a

464
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,880
great time for one at least then I

465
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,210
cannot come and vote in Google do if

466
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,880
anything or is google supposed to do

467
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,590
anything about this um well it's google

468
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,920
supposed to do anything about it why

469
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,900
Google is a very big advertisement

470
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,370
company so I suppose it's not something

471
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:12,290
they would like to do perhaps anyway

472
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,120
something that there are dar thinks that

473
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,150
can be done i actually heard I think

474
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,180
gormiti told me about there's gonna be a

475
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,320
meeting I think on the 28th or 29th of

476
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,130
October with plenty of different vendors

477
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,040
to come and sit together and see what's

478
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,920
possible towards ad kits to find a more

479
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,200
reasonable solution because for now we

480
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,630
don't know if we should detect it or not

481
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:43,160
it's really difficult this is there for

482
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,110
a reason unless it smell where it's

483
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,920
there for a reason Yeah Yeah right any

484
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,110
questions from the audience no let's

485
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,350
thank
