1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,380
okay so I'm not really used to doing

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,480
these kinds of presentation so I hope

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,120
you bear with me and that no one brought

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,599
eggs okay so welcome so this talk is

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,030
called surviving Syria days reducing the

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,160
window of exposure my name isn't Desmond

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,689
and as John said it was John right I'm

8
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,369
from Sweden okay so mandatory slide

9
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,320
about me I work as a security analyst

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,420
and architect for a company called I

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,610
secure Sweden we do a lot of security

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,190
operation stuff so I'm I'm more of a

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,510
hands-on security analysts than them for

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,200
example the ones working for 451

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,920
research for example I used to work for

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,410
bald whitey work there for 10 years

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,410
doing different security stuff so I've

18
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,050
always been a defender started out in

19
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,289
network security and moved on as I

20
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,850
imagine most defenders do and if you

21
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,610
want to chat with me and twitter is

22
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,799
probably the best place so if you want

23
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,420
to follow someone who has opinions about

24
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,310
everything I'm your map okay so what I'm

25
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,310
going so what am I gonna talk about I'm

26
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,290
going to talk about software

27
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,619
vulnerabilities and exploits and how we

28
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,630
are currently protecting against

29
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,200
exploits in software vulnerabilities and

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,810
I'm gonna suggest a way of improving

31
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,270
what we do because it's not really

32
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,759
working and it's actually not that hard

33
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:44,040
to get better okay so most companies i

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,640
work for enterprises i do consulting

35
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,110
work for enterprises so most companies

36
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,250
enterprises organizations they have a

37
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,350
like a defense model a security

38
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,880
architecture that's meant to protect

39
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,380
them from threats from attacks of

40
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,450
different kinds and this is usually

41
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,878
built from the concept of defense in

42
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,849
depth and defense in that you all know

43
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,379
everything about that I think it's a

44
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:13,980
great

45
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,190
concept it's a bit abstract so it can be

46
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,930
interpreted in a lot of different ways

47
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,269
and it's been around for a very long

48
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:23,580
time and when this was you know first

49
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,769
turned into an implementation on the

50
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:28,980
corporate level it looked a bit

51
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,690
something like this and everything and

52
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,730
everybody is doing it pretty much the

53
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,010
same way so you had a lot of focus on

54
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,750
the on the network on the perimeter

55
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,480
stuff so you had the firewalls in the

56
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,000
proxies and the IPS and the VPNs and all

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,340
that and then you had access controls

58
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,410
and you did some basic system hardening

59
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,900
and you had antivirus and that was about

60
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,239
it and at that time that was pretty add

61
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,280
add with it and then time rolled by and

62
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,150
our defense this evil so now we got all

63
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,329
the legacy stuff but our legacy stuff is

64
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:05,609
better because you know our IPS is our

65
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:07,890
better or at least more expensive our

66
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,450
antivirus has evolved and all the stuff

67
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,549
is getting better we we're not using

68
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:18,720
ntlm anymore we're using Kerberos but

69
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,209
we've got more stuff now we got CM and

70
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:23,400
we get the DLP in application firewalls

71
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,319
and maybe if you really advanced we got

72
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,709
fire i but it's basically just more

73
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,720
tools because in enterprises when you

74
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,299
have a problem you buy a two that's how

75
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,579
it works you don't really you know get

76
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:40,500
to the root cause of the problem that

77
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,970
often and sometime during the last maybe

78
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:52,919
ten years and this this not new attack

79
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,590
vector but one attack vector started

80
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,359
gaining prominence and that was

81
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:59,400
client-side attacks and I'm talking

82
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,560
specifically about attacks on

83
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,500
client-side software and this has been

84
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,819
around a number of years and it's

85
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:08,310
statistically the biggest attack vector

86
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,010
we've got right now and it's the ones

87
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,900
that the apt for example is mostly

88
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,560
targeting because it works so if we take

89
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,510
a look at this security architecture

90
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,240
that would get or the defense model that

91
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,800
we've got water

92
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,120
the components that are actually

93
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,259
protecting us from this so it looks a

94
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:35,229
bit like this so we get the firewall and

95
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:37,509
it's you know the really advanced

96
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:39,789
next-generation firewall that can do

97
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:41,620
dynamic content inspection and all that

98
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,379
stuff and we get the IPS which is really

99
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:46,860
expensive and has a lot of signatures

100
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,009
actually doing a pretty good job and we

101
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:52,659
get the antivirus or the endpoint

102
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,699
protection suites that does a lot more

103
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:59,020
than just antivirus so I've spoken to a

104
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,139
lot of penetration testers around the

105
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:04,930
world and I've asked them do you see

106
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,919
what I see when you attack people when

107
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,889
you attack client-side is this what you

108
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:15,490
see and they've said yes pretty much

109
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,330
hundred percent said yes and then I

110
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,009
asked them do you have a problem by

111
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:23,860
passing this and they say no and I'm

112
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,879
pretty sure they're exaggerating because

113
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,889
the offensive side of security you know

114
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,610
they like to look down at the defense

115
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,830
side of security but even if they are

116
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,349
exaggerating they're still able to

117
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:43,349
bypass it to a degree I'd say and so

118
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:46,750
this whole model actually assumes that

119
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,150
the target is behind the first two

120
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,190
controls and we all know that's not the

121
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,310
case because we're very mobile now we go

122
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,440
to to the coffee shop on the corner and

123
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,289
we connect our computers and the

124
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:01,479
firewall and the IPS goes out the window

125
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:08,409
so and that and what about Syria days

126
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,389
unknown vulnerabilities are these

127
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:12,849
controls able to catch that well some

128
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:15,310
people say that they do but I'd say that

129
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,190
mostly they don't and we can talk about

130
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,990
that later if you want to and so what

131
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,060
does this mean well it means that our

132
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,029
perimeter has changed the perimeter

133
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:31,539
isn't on the network anymore but our

134
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:33,789
defenses didn't really change we're

135
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:35,500
still doing it the same way and I'm

136
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,080
talking corporate I know a lot of you

137
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,300
are working in the antivirus in

138
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,400
it and you know better but in

139
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,520
corporations in enterprises we're still

140
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,129
doing defense the same way as we've

141
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:53,110
always done we don't care about what's

142
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,659
happening in the outside world so that

143
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:59,550
basically leaves us with antivirus and

144
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,740
Andrew said just that a couple of

145
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,409
minutes ago that there's a lot of things

146
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:08,020
depending on antivirus and I don't think

147
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,690
it's fair because antivirus is one thing

148
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,909
can't catch everything it's impossible

149
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:17,979
so do you remember the New York Times

150
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:23,620
hack so earlier this year it became

151
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,930
public knowledge that the New York Times

152
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,810
had been hacked and that an allegedly

153
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,300
Chinese group called comment group or

154
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,240
apt one whichever you prefer had spent

155
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,639
something like four months in the New

156
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,780
York Times networks and the New York

157
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,240
Times was using semantic as their

158
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,449
antivirus supplier and a lot of people

159
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:48,340
in the security industry started

160
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,319
pointing the finger at symantec saying

161
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,250
why didn't you catch this so you're

162
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,969
useless why didn't you catch this and to

163
00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:00,490
me they were asking all the wrong

164
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,210
questions because to me the question is

165
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,180
why are we only using antivirus why

166
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,389
aren't we doing anything else I mean we

167
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,539
know about this why are we expecting

168
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:16,419
antivirus to do everything it's it's

169
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:18,969
it's a good thing antivirus I like

170
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:20,500
antivirus but it's not a magic bullet

171
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:26,379
and semantics responded with this blog

172
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:29,409
post and I think that last sentence is

173
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:34,240
very true and I think as an industry we

174
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,399
need to start teaching our customers

175
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,349
this and I know some people are but I

176
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:41,349
know some people aren't too and that's

177
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:45,240
antivirus software alone is not enough

178
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,829
but then again we patch right so it's

179
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:50,300
okay right

180
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,930
well kinda but we do it slowly even the

181
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,759
people that do it fast do it slow

182
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:00,089
because there's always a window where

183
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:02,699
you haven't patched and the patch is out

184
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:05,040
and it's going to get reverse engineered

185
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,500
really fast and sometimes we can't even

186
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,110
patch because you know we might have a

187
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,790
legacy system so third-party systems

188
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,009
that are going to break once we roll out

189
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:21,209
that new update so how many VPNs break

190
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:25,230
every time Java is updated and those are

191
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,829
security vendors I mean there's a lot of

192
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:31,410
things that that are breaking every time

193
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,170
something is updated and people who

194
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,879
haven't worked in an enterprise doesn't

195
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:38,519
know that and these are generally like

196
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,189
business critical systems so it's not

197
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:43,920
really an option to just get rid of Java

198
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,860
you have to do something else so and

199
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,110
another thing that comes into play when

200
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:55,439
you can't patch is something called HD

201
00:09:55,439 --> 00:09:57,800
Moore's law and this was something that

202
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,500
Josh Korman of akamai came up with

203
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,720
earlier this year and he basically said

204
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,500
that once an exploit is in metasploit

205
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,839
the potential number of attackers

206
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,399
increase exponentially and this is

207
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,910
because when an exploit is in metasploit

208
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,399
you don't have to be skilled at you know

209
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,800
exploit development or you know in

210
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,730
anything other than basic clinics and

211
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,589
metasploit and that's really easy anyone

212
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:33,569
can do it I can so it's fairly so that's

213
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:36,180
not a very good thing and what about

214
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,370
Syria days I mean we can't patch them

215
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,000
and but is anyone really exploiting

216
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,160
Syria days does that happen or is that a

217
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,870
myth because I tend to find that my

218
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,689
corporate customers they're like okay so

219
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,209
we'll just take sierra days and we place

220
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:52,980
it over here with the Red Riding Hood

221
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,230
and the other fairy tales but you know

222
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,610
Microsoft has a report out called

223
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,290
software vulnerability exploitation

224
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,690
trends and this is a very good

225
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,880
report I suggest you all go and read it

226
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,080
if you haven't already and there's a lot

227
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,300
of interesting information in this but

228
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,860
one of the things that really stood out

229
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,480
to me with this so it turns out that

230
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,650
forty-six percent of remote code

231
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,090
execution vulnerability in microsoft

232
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,600
software was actually exploited before a

233
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,160
patch was available during 2012 so

234
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,710
that's about half that's like something

235
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,960
like 15 vulnerabilities if i'm not

236
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,800
mistaken and you'll know about what's

237
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,720
happening right now there's an Internet

238
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,420
Explorer cirle out that is actively

239
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,440
being exploited so yes sira days are

240
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,490
being exploited for real and do you

241
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,370
remember this so back in december 2012

242
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,610
in january 2013 there was a watering

243
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,140
hole attack on an iOS developer website

244
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,390
and something along the lines of 10 15

245
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,690
maybe 20 companies was compromised by

246
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,970
this java zero-day that Oracle knew

247
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,640
about but hadn't gotten around to

248
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:17,930
patching and among the companies

249
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,850
compromised was Microsoft Twitter

250
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,540
Facebook and Apple so companies that

251
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,880
you'd expect to have a pretty good grip

252
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,090
on security I've actually discussed this

253
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,990
with one of Twitter's security guys and

254
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,730
he said yeah we had nothing that could

255
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,030
have prevented this and we do a lot of

256
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:44,520
stuff but it didn't work so my point

257
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,150
here is that no one seems to be able to

258
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,480
use anything that can actually prevent

259
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,900
the zero-day exploit or defeat certain

260
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,240
exploit and this is kind of interesting

261
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,940
I think because it's not really that

262
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,930
hard or and I can see a lot of you now

263
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,610
going so wait a minute I feel cheated

264
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,320
wasn't this guy who's supposed to be

265
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,839
talking about flashy seared a defense

266
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,540
and yeah I am but there's no flashy fix

267
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,529
I mean there's no two

268
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:20,079
you can't go out and buy a tool for this

269
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,990
because we've tried that it doesn't work

270
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,649
and it's no red button that you can

271
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:28,680
press that's going to make this go away

272
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,160
this is going to go on and on so we need

273
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,519
to get our priorities straight because

274
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,129
we need to actually decide what we're

275
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:42,370
going to defend and who we're going to

276
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:47,139
defend against because right now you

277
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:50,649
know how many companies do actually have

278
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:54,819
to deal with apt attacks I mean maybe we

279
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:58,059
don't know but if I can take a guess I'd

280
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:03,220
say that it's not the majority at least

281
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,819
so a lot of our customers actually have

282
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:10,749
other concerns more pressing concerns if

283
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,389
you've got configure running wild in

284
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:16,360
your network maybe you shouldn't be

285
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,660
focusing on catching a pt's first maybe

286
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,259
you should handle the basics first so

287
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:27,939
and I mean the client side is a huge

288
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:30,430
attack vector that we're not doing

289
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:35,379
enough to protect so what I'm suggesting

290
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:38,500
is that we get back to basics that we

291
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,879
actually start working with our

292
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,220
environments like for real working with

293
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,600
our environments working on

294
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,240
configuration and things like that

295
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,500
instead of buying tools and that we

296
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,149
actually start using the tools we have

297
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:54,670
because we have good tools that really

298
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,670
expensive IPS isn't just expensive

299
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,540
because it says tipping point it's

300
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,230
actually pretty good if you use it and

301
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,360
we need to start focusing on what

302
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,120
matters like what really matters where

303
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,459
can we actually make a difference that

304
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:18,459
we can see so and how do I suggest we do

305
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:22,449
that well I say we do hardening and I've

306
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:24,040
already said that we do hardening

307
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,750
because I said that in the legacy

308
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,870
implementation of defense in depth but

309
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,000
that's on a really high level

310
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,430
and what we're doing there is kind of

311
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:37,720
legacy too so because that's mostly like

312
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,630
we're disabling the administrator

313
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,730
account and you know we're enabling the

314
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,100
windows firewall and we're you know

315
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,440
we're not allowing users to build local

316
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,110
admins or if we're really advanced you

317
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,140
know we're not allowing users to start

318
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:57,990
cmd.exe but that's that's sanitary stuff

319
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:04,720
we need to do more so why don't we do it

320
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,150
to the software because if you think

321
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,850
about it the software is actually the

322
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,650
gateway to the system and the

323
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:17,080
environment for an attacker and to do

324
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,090
that we need to identify what software

325
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:23,650
we need to protect and Mark Twain said

326
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,280
once upon a while that once upon a while

327
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,230
what does that mean so history does not

328
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,020
repeat itself but it does rhyme and this

329
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,800
is true because two things to exact same

330
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,790
things rarely happens twice but similar

331
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,480
things happen all the time so what can

332
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,020
we learn from history done well we can

333
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,030
learn where we have seen vulnerabilities

334
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:52,720
before in what software and we can see

335
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,270
what those vulnerabilities were and we

336
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,520
can see were these vulnerabilities even

337
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,650
exploited because if you look at for

338
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,350
example Google Chrome and you look at

339
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,000
the number of vulnerabilities that has

340
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,040
been found in google chrome and then you

341
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,349
look at the number of exploits that have

342
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,480
actually been used for google chrome

343
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,390
you'll find that it's not very many if

344
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,699
you look at internet explorer you'll

345
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:16,720
find that there's a lot of

346
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,310
vulnerabilities but they're actually

347
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,329
being used so maybe internet explorer is

348
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:23,619
we should focus more on internet

349
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:26,740
explorer learn on google chrome and we

350
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,720
can look at so what could we have done

351
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,840
to defeat these exploits that we've

352
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:38,260
actually seen in use and so what I

353
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,160
suggest that we start doing now is

354
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,270
something I call software hardening

355
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,180
and we can do a number of things here

356
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,650
these are just examples but we could use

357
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,670
some very basic exploit mitigation

358
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,090
techniques like making sure that a SLR

359
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,170
and DP is enabled and we can use the

360
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,930
enhanced litigation experience toolkit

361
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,750
which is really good and we can you know

362
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,880
actually make an effort to do secure

363
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,750
configuration for these softwares like

364
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,240
we can set the software restriction

365
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,180
policy and we can actually use the

366
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,650
native security settings in the

367
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,260
applications which we rarely even touch

368
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:30,500
it's all default so and this sounds like

369
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:36,440
okay but does this work so there's this

370
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,480
thing called the exploit intelligence

371
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,790
project that's run by a guy called Dan

372
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:45,200
Guido of trail of bits and these are

373
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,770
he's been doing the exploit intelligence

374
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,860
project since 2009 and these are some

375
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,850
some of his statistics for 2009 and 2010

376
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,380
just to give you some history so what is

377
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,770
done is that he's taking the d 15 top

378
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,860
exploit kids during this time and he has

379
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,170
looked at the the exploits that these

380
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,020
actually used and it turns out that it's

381
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,340
27 and if you look at it so out of 19

382
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,570
memory corruption bugs 14 of the

383
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,640
exploits for them could be defeated by

384
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,920
enabling dep 17 by enabling a SLR and

385
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,650
all of them by using the enhanced

386
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:36,230
mitigation experience toolkit so why is

387
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,010
this why is it's so easy to protect from

388
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,710
this well because attackers don't work

389
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,060
harder than they have to why right and a

390
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,880
SLR bypass if no one is using a SLR

391
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,670
right ok so that was history

392
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,270
does it work now well there are some

393
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:03,080
things that have changed and we have

394
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,540
actually better native defense is now

395
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,790
because windows 7 is more secure than

396
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,400
windows XP was and Internet Explorer 9

397
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,040
is more secure than internet explorer 7

398
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,840
loss and but attackers you know people

399
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,990
writing mass malware you know doing math

400
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,200
attacks they haven't really you know

401
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,400
caught up so and that means that there's

402
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,770
actually been a reduction on number of

403
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,930
attack vectors that they can use because

404
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:38,240
because like a modern standard desktop

405
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,270
build are actually using a SLR and dep

406
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:45,670
and sandboxing so you there's not as

407
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:50,060
much room for attacks anymore and it

408
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,610
turns out that if you look at where

409
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:56,590
exploits that these exploit packs are

410
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,650
using now where the exploit come from

411
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,110
these people aren't really writing their

412
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,930
own exploits they're begging for scraps

413
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,410
from security researchers and when

414
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,880
someone publishes an exploit technique

415
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,390
using by any apt they pick that up and

416
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,080
use it but they don't develop their own

417
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,300
so if you look at where exploits used

418
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,370
today in these 15 exploit kids are

419
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:28,520
coming from we can see that all the

420
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,180
memory corruption exploits came from apt

421
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,720
campaigns or whooping and whooping isn't

422
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,180
really gonna you know publicly disclose

423
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,330
their coolest most advanced techniques

424
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,300
which means that the people writing

425
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,360
exploit packs are actually you know left

426
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,000
with what whooping considers to be

427
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,500
pretty lame so no cool bypasses and all

428
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,510
the job exploits came from security

429
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:02,770
researchers so that means that well

430
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,880
they're not really upping their game

431
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,850
their attacks are still working to a

432
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,610
very low

433
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,730
degree mainly because of Java and we're

434
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,720
not doing anything about Java except

435
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,890
somewhere so if we do these things if we

436
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:24,980
do these very basic things or we secure

437
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:31,130
well no we're not because things like

438
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:36,350
apts and similar threats still exists

439
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,330
which is why we can't stop there and

440
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,520
this is also problem we tend to you know

441
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,260
do one thing and then okay we're done

442
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,410
I'm gonna go do some something else so

443
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,750
we need to keep working and we need to

444
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,600
do more hardening we need to actually go

445
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,270
back and do our system hardening again

446
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,179
based on what we know today not what we

447
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,890
knew 15 years ago when we did it the

448
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,990
first time and we didn't need to do it

449
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,580
on the network and we need to actually

450
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,299
start using the tools that we have based

451
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:09,030
on what we know today and we knew and we

452
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,070
need to go back to the people and the

453
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,220
processes and look at okay so what are

454
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,400
we doing that makes us more exposed like

455
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:24,179
do we actually feed a behavior full of

456
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,340
bad security practices like are we

457
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:31,429
accepting invoices emailed to us in PDFs

458
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:34,740
because that actually feeds the behavior

459
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,630
of I'm gonna open this attachment no

460
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,540
matter who sent it so maybe change that

461
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:43,950
and by doing this we can actually reduce

462
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,940
the window of exposure proactively

463
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,549
because we're actually in erasing our

464
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:53,400
security baseline we're improving our

465
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,110
security posture proactively we're doing

466
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,380
it before we're doing it and but if we

467
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,679
do all these things eventually the bad

468
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,559
guys are going to have to you know

469
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,700
improve they're going to have to up

470
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,290
their game and when they do we need to

471
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,270
make sure that we've got the threat

472
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,540
Intel that we need to detect these

473
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,059
changes we need to know when trends are

474
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,060
changing

475
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,390
and so we need to know that when we're

476
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,600
seeing software vulnerabilities in

477
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,970
software being exploited and this

478
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,710
software is not the ones we've

479
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:36,250
identified as critical to protect we

480
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,490
need to change our defenses accordingly

481
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,560
so we need to keep in touch with what's

482
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,690
happening in the outside world something

483
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,220
that we're not doing now either on a

484
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,400
corporate level so we need to go back

485
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,440
then and we need to plug the gaps that

486
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,980
was left and we need to do this based on

487
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,990
what we've learned and we need to you

488
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,250
know and this is going to keep our

489
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,130
defenses current because as I said we

490
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,320
have a connection to the outside world

491
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,660
and then we need to do it again and

492
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:09,610
again and again and again because the

493
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,800
world is going to change sooner or later

494
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,660
the world is going to change and we have

495
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:19,230
to change with it so to summarize

496
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,060
priorities is everything priorities is

497
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,850
key we need to get better at

498
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,250
prioritizing what we're going to do and

499
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,380
we need to get better at helping our

500
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,740
customers prioritizing we need to stop

501
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,940
feeding them about apts all the

502
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,580
time it's not working it's not helping

503
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,910
anyone and we actually need to get back

504
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,040
to our environments and start you know

505
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,950
getting to know it from a security

506
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:51,010
perspective and this work will never be

507
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,410
done we have to keep doing it over and

508
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:59,010
over again and finally keep calm and

509
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:02,310
defense in depth

510
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,000
thank you very much are there any

511
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,970
questions so if you if you do have

512
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,330
questions I'll just remind you to put

513
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,190
your hand up and microphone will be

514
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:25,429
brought around to you I think there's a

515
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:28,470
waiting in the meantime we just have a

516
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,929
minute or two so do you see that there

517
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:33,660
is a long term solution to this problem

518
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:38,820
at all and you know like a standardized

519
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,490
long-term solution yeah I mean it

520
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,830
instead of playing catch-up all the time

521
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,929
you see that there is an end game at any

522
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:51,150
point and not really i think you know as

523
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,450
long as there's there's a there's a

524
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:59,250
drive and as long as there's there's a

525
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,080
way to capitalize on vulnerabilities I

526
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,400
mean the bad guys are going to keep

527
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,980
doing it but this is actually a way to

528
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,970
of getting ahead of them they are gonna

529
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,900
have to know do catch up with us and we

530
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,429
don't know I know exploit writers or

531
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:24,299
exploit pack authors we don't really

532
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:28,049
know what their capabilities are so we

533
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:30,600
need to try them win we need to push

534
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,380
them and see if they can actually push

535
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,360
back or if the landscape is going to

536
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:43,939
change any anyone else have questions

537
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,789
so either you understood me or you

538
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:54,129
didn't understand me at all great ok

539
00:27:54,129 --> 00:27:56,590
