1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,639
afternoon everyone right onto the the

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,049
real final stretch for this afternoon

3
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:11,880
just one last reminder so at the end of

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,820
the at the conference the hotel is

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,289
arranged for an extra number of taxis to

6
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:17,940
be ready and wedding for all of those of

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,680
you that need to disappear off to the

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,480
airport and fly after after the

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,330
conferences completes now at this point

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,949
in time I'd like to introduce sushi

11
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:30,869
he'll be talking about the hacking team

12
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:33,300
and Gama international in business to

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,270
government malware over to you surgeon

14
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,450
well hello my name is Sergio Goliath and

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,660
I'm trying to set up my timer to be

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,730
right on time just give me a second okay

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,379
so my name is George Illawarra if I'm

18
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,629
the malware expert the Kaspersky Lab so

19
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,180
my job title means that I'm researcher

20
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,309
developer inventor and right now and

21
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,230
public speaker so you know that there

22
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,329
are several stories about the government

23
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,940
malware for example Germany in China but

24
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,220
I'm going to talk about particular about

25
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,780
the two cases and actually with the

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,760
hacking team and the Gama international

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,010
I think that some of you already know

28
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,990
the cases which I'm going to talk about

29
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,960
but just to just quickly remind you and

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,020
to make you feel how house bad to fight

31
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,210
with this kind of malware I want to show

32
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,009
you just one video you have new

33
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,090
challenges today

34
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,560
sensitive data is transmitted over

35
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,220
encrypted channels often the information

36
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,550
you want is not transmitted at all your

37
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,190
target may be outside your monitoring

38
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,330
domain is passive monitoring enough you

39
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,810
need more you want to look through your

40
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,100
targets eyes you have to hack your

41
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:02,390
target you have to hit many different

42
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,170
platforms

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,250
you have to overcome encryption and

44
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:18,910
capture relevant data being stealth and

45
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,780
untraceable

46
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:32,290
deployed all over your country exactly

47
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:41,069
what we do in control system Galileo

48
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,980
the hacking suite for governmental

49
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,940
interception

50
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:57,209
rely on us so this is gives you just an

51
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:58,920
example what we are going to talk about

52
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,099
and personname me this story started

53
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,650
with some letter that will receive 24 of

54
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,260
July the last year that percentage a lot

55
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,569
of security companies that contains the

56
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:11,910
chart fire with their Mac malware inside

57
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,069
it so right now we know that this case

58
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,290
was connected with the Moroccan case

59
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,780
where the journalist from Morocco was

60
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,360
attacked by this malware and of course

61
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,519
it was a lot of buzz because in the

62
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,959
media because he's in journalists and

63
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,730
it's really bad idea to attack the

64
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,579
journalists so he's the case and when I

65
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,560
talk about that political and you know

66
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,950
social questions about the lawful

67
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,500
interception we I cannot mention his

68
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,579
name his name is mr. Morgan here he

69
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:44,040
works for the Citizen lab and he working

70
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,650
in Google X security researcher so he

71
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,049
got you know skills he got knowledge and

72
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,799
you know he gets their source of

73
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,120
information so a lot of people are

74
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,010
trusting him and are sending him the

75
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,010
images of their laptops the samples and

76
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,670
he can you know directly access to the

77
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,590
victims who can share with him the

78
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,280
information

79
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,310
well I not have the sources so I started

80
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,900
to analyze this malware as well as

81
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,359
regularly doing with their you know with

82
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:14,370
the Zeus the Stuxnet and all those other

83
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,209
stuff so I started to analyze it like a

84
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,620
classic malware so the first of all I

85
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,630
needed there proves that this sample

86
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,360
this binary was really developed by the

87
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,669
hacking team but you know no but no law

88
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:28,919
enforcement will give me the computer

89
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,930
for the forensic analysis of the

90
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,610
developer love hiking team so I need

91
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,800
some evidence so the evidence was like

92
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,380
so the first one was obvious in all

93
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,789
materials of the hacking team they're

94
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:42,360
using their RSS I got letters to

95
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,490
describe their functionality then we've

96
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,349
got the same functionality in the same

97
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:49,110
latest in the binaries then it was the

98
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,090
export which is part this is available

99
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,370
on the virus topple that then also

100
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,909
payloads from the hacking team subdomain

101
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:59,450
and the last one that

102
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,910
in the Sun version of the Trojan the

103
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,670
path where the source quartz was located

104
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,090
was in the name for the username greed

105
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,450
and suddenly guida is the name of the

106
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,760
senior developer at the hacking team so

107
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,770
well you know I don't have the you know

108
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,840
proofs for the course that this malware

109
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,000
was developed by hacking team but as a

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,890
searcher this information is really

111
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:26,420
enough for me so what can I do so we

112
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,250
started to analyzes the functions of the

113
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,790
samples and we need you know information

114
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,350
from the published sources and no big

115
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,110
leaks there are some documents about the

116
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,360
functions and how the hacking team is

117
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,130
propagating my wiring I was describing

118
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,350
and the same functions were located in

119
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,690
the binary so screenshots in record

120
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,440
audio making the video from the victims

121
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,830
computer and so on but you know the

122
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,880
actually the were several other

123
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,020
interesting things that wouldn't

124
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,260
describe for first of all it was this

125
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,850
there was a self replication mechanism

126
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,180
so for example in Russia if the judge

127
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,480
gives the law enforcement you know right

128
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,450
to spy for someone judge will never

129
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,490
never never allow the law enforcement to

130
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,530
for example monitor all the you know

131
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,020
random people and the friends of the of

132
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,930
the suspects but malware you know allows

133
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,360
law enforcement to you know replicates

134
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,180
and in fact any computer with this flash

135
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,950
drive then it's got the infection of

136
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,990
virtual machines it can work with the

137
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,690
mobile platforms then is got the built

138
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,850
to set up date installation drivers and

139
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,700
usually the samples are sign it my my

140
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,420
you know authorities so now the the

141
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,010
fourth and the fifth

142
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,800
you know layer is really really

143
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,900
important because the worst scenario of

144
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,980
using the law enforcement tool is the

145
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,830
case when the law enforcement the

146
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,410
officer for example in some country it's

147
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,690
possibility can install the malware

148
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,110
inside the machine then updated this

149
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,210
malware with additional code and this

150
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,710
additional code will download some

151
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,960
forbidden content from the internet like

152
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,420
a child porn on the computer and then

153
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,810
this code will be you know self deleted

154
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,210
after that law enforcement scan clock

155
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,130
the door and said like yeah guilty and

156
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:22,389
the guy will have no no no nothing to do

157
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:23,860
with it because there will be no

158
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,990
evidence that the malware was existing

159
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,169
on his computer so the other way is the

160
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:31,690
how it's propagating we got the several

161
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,970
documents and described the physical

162
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,900
access then we have the remote methods

163
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,500
for installation social social

164
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,020
engineering the self update like

165
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,210
subsonic jars like in Moroccan case then

166
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,180
we learned that were lots of for example

167
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,240
attachments with the file name flesh of

168
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,250
data to see and then we started to see

169
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,000
the exploits well I was you know

170
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,610
searching in our antivirus collection

171
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,860
for their samples that was actually used

172
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,949
to install the smell way and you know

173
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:13,210
for example the the idea was that for

174
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,759
example this sample was detected in June

175
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,930
and the vulnerability was the scored in

176
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,479
September so I could just compare with

177
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,020
this date and I see that for example

178
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,810
whooping was like the most actually

179
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,630
publisher of the exploits and the last

180
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,520
one was described discovered by me so

181
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,099
wise was lovely lucky I passed this zero

182
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,440
data Adobe unfortunately I don't be

183
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,370
right now have more interesting stuff to

184
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,459
deal with but anyway there's the zero

185
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:48,339
that was discovered and this zero day

186
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:50,140
was you know mentioned now the be case

187
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,079
it's with was the case when this

188
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:55,660
exploits and this malware was founded in

189
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,690
the US but the C&C server was located in

190
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,690
other country and you know this is a

191
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,459
real big problem for the you know

192
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,290
international cooperation between law

193
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,000
enforcement because it's not allowed for

194
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,079
example the FBI to to monitor citizens

195
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:13,390
in Russia and the same time before the

196
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,279
fees be you know we got no power in the

197
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,040
US so the you know the malware is cross

198
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,589
boarded and here's the an example of how

199
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:22,720
they smell a can act the other borders

200
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,060
and so the the name of the slightest

201
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,830
Frisby spy or is it the hacking team

202
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,750
malware well I don't know guys who

203
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,390
decided to call this malware FSB because

204
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,860
the if is being you know got no

205
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,650
connection with the hacking team and we

206
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,450
had a lot of fight between the

207
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,010
researchers who was analyzing the

208
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,060
samples to prove that the FSB spy is the

209
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,350
just a code reuse of Arceus malware so

210
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,670
if we talk about the countries let's

211
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,660
like see the map so well we didn't make

212
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,410
this special

213
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,850
you know detection for the hacking team

214
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,770
malware because we get a lot of

215
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,810
automation system that detecting a lot

216
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,150
of malware and this automatic system

217
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,340
really do not care about the source of

218
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,530
the malware so I just collect the old

219
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,410
verdict and place it on the map and the

220
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,950
map we see the Mexico is the most

221
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,960
infected country by this malware and

222
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,760
please remember this country I will

223
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:23,690
describe it the cases in future but if

224
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,910
you need you know the more accurate data

225
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,610
not from the Kaspersky Lab you maybe you

226
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,240
should use this data the fingerprint so

227
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,480
the citizen lab Morgan have discovered

228
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,390
the c2 fingerprint for searching the

229
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,550
servers of the finfisher so I've died

230
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,910
the same so he is the request so this is

231
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,430
like specific names of the files and you

232
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,150
will ask some web server about this

233
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,410
dislocation of this files then the ants

234
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,060
were of the scene sister will be like

235
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,630
this so air or air charge collector or

236
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,730
any key is there you know offset in the

237
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,730
binary where it was generated roar in

238
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,610
fact this is where I'm stopping my

239
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,580
researching me guess you know mr. Ross

240
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,810
and yesterday on the Symantec

241
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,430
presentation how there was in hauling

242
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,410
really good jobs in holding the zero

243
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,320
access it's a huge success but you know

244
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,460
I don't want to think all these botnets

245
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,560
because you know if I'll try to do this

246
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,710
then I will you know immediately to get

247
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,080
charges for the Block in the judgment

248
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,600
and he is that the technical information

249
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,180
that could be publicly available but no

250
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,700
for the steps and well of course I'm

251
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,110
continuing my research you can trying to

252
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,510
fight another zero days that should be

253
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:38,889
used

254
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:41,470
the explanation of abilities to install

255
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,559
this kind of malware but you know no

256
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,720
active research right now about the

257
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,109
hockey team the other story

258
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:54,220
this is story about the finisher well

259
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,439
this is much more sophisticated malware

260
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:59,019
than hacking team and for example if you

261
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,720
know some techniques that can be used to

262
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,209
prove you know to block the researcher

263
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:06,100
to avoid the detection then this

264
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,329
technique is available in the contrition

265
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,489
my way it's a boot kit is it's

266
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:14,559
virtualized it's a post kata several

267
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,470
layers of encryption so it took me about

268
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,480
the one month to you see you know to

269
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,059
look at the exactly clean binary and and

270
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:23,859
it asked my colleagues to help me with

271
00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:26,949
that because it's too much job to do but

272
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:30,009
but at the end we were you know clean

273
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:32,350
their will clean all the stuff and

274
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,839
cynical so what is it about well the

275
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:36,220
first of all the methods of propagation

276
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,989
so there were a lot of documents about

277
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:43,329
the finfisher on the Vic Alex and I

278
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,160
describing the physical access and

279
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,230
physical by way of installation of this

280
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,899
malware at the same time would discover

281
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:52,329
the social engineering techniques for

282
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:55,540
in-store installation and one one and

283
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,329
one was really you know funny because I

284
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:02,499
saw that that malware was detected on

285
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:05,589
some you know web sites in the name and

286
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:07,809
the file name of the malware was the

287
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:10,629
flash update that X Z so when of course

288
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:12,610
I go to this website and it's close

289
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,429
nothing over there but you know it's

290
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:18,519
really hard to hide in the Internet so

291
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,689
the main tools screenshot make it

292
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:25,480
screenshot of this domain when it was

293
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,519
actually propagating the finfisher

294
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,459
and you know this is domain so I see the

295
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:32,110
content of the site and this is a

296
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,829
phishing site of the news media and in

297
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:39,100
some country let's say so the guys who

298
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,049
was stalling this software was used as

299
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:44,439
social techniques and yes

300
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:46,809
no exports at all I couldn't find

301
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:48,399
anything zero then not zero day

302
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,170
everything is clean so

303
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,709
maybe you will find it then I will you

304
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:59,380
know shake your hand but I had black

305
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,019
again functions the list of the

306
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:04,970
functions you completely know almost the

307
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,800
same as they were hacking team we're

308
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,370
also forensic job but you know the most

309
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,680
interesting part was the list of the

310
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,620
applications that can be used to you

311
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,899
know get the passwords get the emails

312
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,750
and so on and maybe some of you don't

313
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,839
know but if in some malware you've got

314
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,820
the Opera browser you've got the bad

315
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,000
email client client must execute

316
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,300
messenger and to speak then that means

317
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,690
that only one country let's say an

318
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,019
exersaucer country this for software got

319
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:41,600
really popular that's why when we

320
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,170
received this map you know we wasn't

321
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:49,250
surprised but I am from Moscow from

322
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,300
Russia and I was surprised because for

323
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,709
example the first presentation and

324
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:56,570
really said that in Russia we got the

325
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,660
big system called Seoul for monitoring

326
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,269
all activity on the Internet and the

327
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,310
telephones and so on and you know

328
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,089
there's really no need to install the

329
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:11,990
kind of tools so we had the three main

330
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,870
theories first of all some police

331
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,230
department bought this two second theory

332
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,100
this is their correct versions of this

333
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,949
too because we and with the finfisher

334
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:26,449
and we're hiking team we got you know

335
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:28,760
some samples that looks like cracked and

336
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,790
the third theory that some are the

337
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,529
government are spying on the russian

338
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:36,380
citizen so we started to look at the

339
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,279
truth and the truth was you know

340
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,199
completely different so all this

341
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:44,990
detection what we see in this map from

342
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,750
robots

343
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,870
you know this cyber and growl russians

344
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,709
and underground are providing no several

345
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:56,449
services to other cyber criminals like

346
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:59,420
affiliate networks for checking

347
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,190
detections it's like very subtle

348
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,160
actually but for the underground using

349
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,940
so and all

350
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,780
victims which is located in Russia

351
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,750
running the virtual machines only they

352
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,670
are using travel issues of Avis and they

353
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,010
detected several ten thousands malware a

354
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,720
day so this is Robert but let's back to

355
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,310
the Mexico the story there was that the

356
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,880
US authorities was catching the narco

357
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,950
boss in the sea they took the boat where

358
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,190
was a several the several kilograms of

359
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,810
kana cortex by using the spyware and

360
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,440
this you know it brings us the good news

361
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,010
because if mr. Morgan is telling that a

362
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,500
lot of cases connected with the fight

363
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,180
again the human rights activist

364
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,090
pro-democratic activist but this case

365
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,760
you know is like making balance between

366
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,209
the good ways of using the malware and

367
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:08,930
the bad ways and actually you know this

368
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,819
is really ridiculous

369
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:16,930
in fact because the malware saves life

370
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:22,540
that's it so how can they do with it

371
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,300
okay so once again what you can do in

372
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,040
what that's what I was looking when I

373
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,100
was was looking when I was looking in

374
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,100
the coat the Western era with the hockey

375
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,650
team you know ability to execute their

376
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,590
any code I was trying to find this

377
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:43,700
functional in the efficient and I didn't

378
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,630
found it so the protocol you know

379
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,060
make conversation with the c2 server is

380
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,340
using the up codes and it is really hard

381
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,560
you know to know when he got the binary

382
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,900
code it's really hard to analyze it but

383
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,450
I've done everything but I can but I

384
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,730
didn't find this up codes and the le

385
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:07,610
possibilities acute codes but the

386
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,929
think Fisher developers got you know

387
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:14,509
challenge they've got the malware for

388
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:17,470
for all available fur performs popular

389
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,379
Windows Mac and Android and we have

390
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:24,409
their malware from the free picture for

391
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:26,869
the Android and you know that the aedra

392
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:28,610
malware is much more easier for

393
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,279
researching and its side of this jar

394
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,759
file apk files there was a class that

395
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:37,759
was fully described fully described they

396
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,220
all functions are up course with malware

397
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,009
can you know say to the c2 server and

398
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:45,830
what si tu savais can answer and inside

399
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,320
of this config file inside of this

400
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,139
malware the war the up chords for

401
00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:54,289
executable files for making the remove

402
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:56,299
shell comments allowed to execute

403
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:59,629
anything you want so that means then

404
00:18:59,629 --> 00:19:01,279
malware can fish'

405
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,669
can execute the anything but we don't

406
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:07,009
have a sample so right now the theory is

407
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:10,369
that somewhere exists the premium

408
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:13,070
version of the finfisher

409
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,749
that can do anything but we got no

410
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:24,590
samples well summary it's a focus to get

411
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,129
my wallet

412
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:28,070
malware and how I learned this well if

413
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,749
it took several months it's a

414
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:33,559
sophisticated no we're trying to avoid

415
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:34,869
detection

416
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:37,429
working with their drivers several ways

417
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:41,029
of you know bypass the hips policies by

418
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:43,519
several methods of injection decodes in

419
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,489
the several processes they use the

420
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:48,769
really hard associated techniques in so

421
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:51,679
on they've got the freeways of

422
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,190
installations there we see the several

423
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,159
hundred infection we are our cloud

424
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:02,139
solutions and what we should do

425
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:04,999
well mr. Andrew Lee and his first

426
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:08,590
presentation was asking us the questions

427
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:13,029
so you know I I didn't have the right

428
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:17,570
answers but you know I cannot recommend

429
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,179
you anything because but I think it

430
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:20,870
could be

431
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:28,640
nice if the law enforcement will not use

432
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,900
the remote methods of installation

433
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,049
dismembered only by physical access no

434
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:39,770
way exploits no social tricks no access

435
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,279
through the ESPYs just a physical access

436
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,360
and during this physical access the law

437
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,770
enforcement can you know use the DRM

438
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,799
technologies so the mailman couldn't be

439
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,779
you know copied to another computer and

440
00:20:56,779 --> 00:20:59,659
then while the physical access please

441
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:06,440
remove the a/v that's it you know I'm

442
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,710
really you know I can explain customers

443
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,590
why the software didn't help him to deal

444
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,980
with my way because we you know with

445
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,470
software you know you can walk you can

446
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,289
work without the hard way so that's it

447
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:24,289
and then you know I understand that for

448
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:25,760
law enforcement it's really you know

449
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,289
hard trick because they need you know

450
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:30,260
making they can know do know the

451
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,169
location of the suspect so maybe they

452
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:35,419
should build a big big monitoring system

453
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,899
which wouldn't read the whole content

454
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:44,870
what all citizens reading of writing but

455
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,210
just you know click the sources that for

456
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,510
example this email was send it from this

457
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,210
IP address and the PD address located

458
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,390
over here and then by physical access

459
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,260
they can delete every install the

460
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,529
malware and that's it but once again

461
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:10,490
it's my opinion only well

462
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,880
in fact this is the end of my

463
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,640
presentation my research but you know it

464
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,310
is a really nice conference I really

465
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,050
like the presentation so I won't think

466
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,360
thank you all friend presented

467
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,260
organization team all participants so I

468
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,200
can I can't you know allow me to end

469
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,240
this presentation with such you know you

470
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,360
know many thoughts negative way what we

471
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,720
should do and so on so I'd like to

472
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,780
entertain you and tell you my story

473
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,720
about my feelings during this research I

474
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,310
was really down because they smell well

475
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,940
you know I have they some ethics and

476
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,220
brains so my brains taught me to do

477
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,160
several things but we can do with the

478
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,000
cybercriminals games and I was really

479
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,490
down and when I wrote the stories from

480
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,140
the Morgan about how this Melville was

481
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,780
used it was terrible so it was a

482
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,950
nightmare for me

483
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:24,110
I didn't slept smoke drink a lot of

484
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,950
alcohol my wife asked me to you know to

485
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,950
eat something so it was a nightmare but

486
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,110
then my friend sent me some link to the

487
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,080
British comedian it was really funny so

488
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,390
I decided to no to deal with my feelings

489
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,220
and to do something to back to the

490
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:48,610
normal life so I decided to write a song

491
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,850
and the song is about the malware the

492
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,420
law-enforcement the AVS about everything

493
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:05,660
about all my feelings enjoy

494
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,379
for junga the heater and malware created

495
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:20,990
for life

496
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,240
I think I'll never ever get you relieved

497
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,820
but today they come to visit

498
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:31,290

question so thanks so basically what we

525
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,050
do is that we have made a claim that we

526
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,780
will detect all malware no matter who is

527
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:42,120
using it yeah yep so well you know we

528
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,390
got the big big automatic systems and we

529
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,940
really you know the robots do you know

530
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,400
anything about the hacking team and this

531
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,330
song so actually you know we hadn't you

532
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,170
know right

533
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:59,170
you know orders to stop blocking it we

534
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,550
don't have them maybe they're an

535
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,890
official way some law enforcement are

536
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,990
coming to us during some conference and

537
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,210
asking you know maybe we should allow

538
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,640
them it's a blue case it's a really big

539
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,400
case so we're saving lives so maybe we

540
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,710
should like but we said okay so well

541
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,760

542
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,340
infrastructure so this is like the roof

543
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,260
