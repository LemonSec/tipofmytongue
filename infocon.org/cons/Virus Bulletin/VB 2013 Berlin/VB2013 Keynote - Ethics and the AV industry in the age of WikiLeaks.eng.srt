1
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:08,010
NSA in the intelligence community in

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,010
general is focused on getting

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,870
intelligence wherever it can by any

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,020
means possible d NSA specifically

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,550
targets the communications of everyone

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,580
it ingests them by default it collects

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,320
them in its system and it filters them

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,609
and it analyzes them and it measures

9
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:26,099
them and it stores them for periods of

10
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:28,019
time simply because that's the easiest

11
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,740
most efficient and most valuable way to

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,680
achieve these ends hon for the national

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,390
security leaker Edward Snowden he is

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,700
underground the u.s. is on the hunt and

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,860
the NSA program he revealed is under

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,480
scrutiny with more questions about

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,550
whether intelligence officials told the

18
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,300
truth to Congress

19
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,530
breaking news overnight about just how

20
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,240
much of our personal lives the

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,310
government has been secretly surveilling

22
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,680
the scope of the newly revealed spying

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,410
program is mind-boggling according to

24
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,750
highly classified documents obtained by

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,660
the post the National Security Agency is

26
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,820
able to tap directly into the server's

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,770
of nine big internet companies

28
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,170
extracting everything from photos and

29
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,050
emails to web surfing to audio and video

30
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:23,759
chats what these documents show is not

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,200
just at the NSA of trying to break the

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,540
codes of encryption to let them get

33
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,640
access to everything but they're forcing

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,410
the companies that provide the

35
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,360
encryption services to put back doors

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,900
into their programs which means again

37
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,180
that not only the NSA but all sorts of

38
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,190
hackers and other governments and all

39
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,650
kinds of ill motivated people can have a

40
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,810
weakness to exploit a vulnerability to

41
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,149
exploit in these systems which makes the

42
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,210
entire Internet insecure for everybody

43
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,590
in the fact that it's all being done as

44
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,060
usual with no transparency or

45
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,650
accountability makes this very

46
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,950
newsworthy

47
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:11,990
ladies and gentlemen welcome to Berlin

48
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,180
it's extremely apt that this conference

49
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:22,500
is taking place in this city in the past

50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,960
this city was associated with something

51
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,270
perhaps less fredley warm and inviting

52
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,920
and welcoming as we find Berlin today

53
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,260
the ministry for state security

54
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,540
sometimes known as the Stasi operated

55
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,830
one of the most far-reaching

56
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,760
surveillance programs of its citizens

57
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,830
that has ever been known in the history

58
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:56,460
of mankind after the fall and the

59
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,180
reunification thousands millions of

60
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,000
documents some of them here you can see

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,630
in this picture were found if you put

62
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,430
them into end who had been 180

63
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,190
kilometers worth of files 35 million

64
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,890
other types of documents the content of

65
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,720
telephone calls photographs everybody

66
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,670
knew that they were being watched but

67
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,520
what they didn't know was the extent and

68
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,200
when they found out the psychological

69
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,530
impact was terrifying and devastating I

70
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,940
want to talk about what's happening now

71
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,430
and I want to ask us some questions

72
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,420
about what we're seeing first of all I

73
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,060
want to look at what's happened how

74
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,550
we've come to get to this history what's

75
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,870
the history of the surveillance that

76
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,530
we're now under I want to talk a little

77
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,780
bit about modern intercept programs and

78
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,459
then I want to ask us why does this

79
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,870
matter I want to look at the public

80
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,580
attitudes what do people think about

81
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,570
what's going on and then I want to talk

82
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,459
a little bit about privacy and security

83
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,670
in the nexus between those things and I

84
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,830
want to also then talk to us about trust

85
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,870
in a digital age what does it mean to

86
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,160
live in the age that we now live in

87
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,410
then I'm going to talk to us what should

88
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,110
our response be as an industry where do

89
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,410
we go from here I'm going to ask us some

90
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,920
questions that we may not like I'm going

91
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,840
to look at some pragmatic options and

92
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,480
I'm hoping that we will be able together

93
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,110
to draw some conclusions from that it

94
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,300
all really started with a challan in

95
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,430
terms of X electronic surveillance and I

96
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,230
won't go back through down to the war

97
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,580
years when we could talk about enigma

98
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,290
and computer codes and all of that stuff

99
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,700
because you already know all that stuff

100
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,400
I think most of you already know most of

101
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,840
this stuff so I'm going to skip through

102
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,820
it quickly but echelon was a global

103
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,800
communication system set up by the UK

104
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,050
Australia New Zealand Canada and the USA

105
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,720
to collect a huge amount of

106
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,970
communications data and it was based on

107
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,470
the fact that we were in the Cold War

108
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,410
and he wanted to surveil all of the

109
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,490
communications from coming out of the

110
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,550
USSR and from the Eastern Bloc it was a

111
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,530
global system for intercepting

112
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,780
communications however after the end of

113
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,770
the Cold War it didn't go away ashalon

114
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,120
continued and in 2001 in July of 2001

115
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,390
the European Union Parliament released a

116
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,830
report that actually said that the

117
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,840
United States was using it to intercept

118
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,570
private and commercial communications

119
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,270
not military communications particularly

120
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,800
it was being used where contracts were

121
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,840
being awarded and this was being used to

122
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,260
justify justification was to prevent

123
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,430
bribery but of course the game changed

124
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,510
in 2001 the tragic events of sep tember

125
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:59,490
the 11th 2001 changed our world we

126
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,560
entered a region we entered an era of

127
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,020
the war on global terror so let's look

128
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,790
at some of the intercept programs that

129
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,120
have arisen since that time first of all

130
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,950
let's look at the UK the UK is one of

131
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,160
the major partners in in the in the

132
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,800
Western Allies if you like of collecting

133
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,360
and sharing communications information

134
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,930
the UK Ripper act passed in two thousand

135
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,540
allowed the collection of any

136
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,340
communications that originated

137
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,050
from a foreign point from an offshore

138
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,310
point they have an ongoing program

139
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,440
called tempera which is collecting all

140
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,970
of this kind of information they can

141
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,270
buffer all of the metadata for the last

142
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,160
30 days of all communications that go

143
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,449
through the UK and they can collect

144
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,220
about three days worth of all internet

145
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,930
communications Russia has a law called

146
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,930
Psalm 2 it allows the FSB the the

147
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,220
Federal Security Service to collect

148
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,419
internet communications credit card

149
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,220
transactions emails all of those things

150
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,790
by requiring ISPs to have a device

151
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,910
installed on the servers and that is

152
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,430
shared with the FSB but after 2000 that

153
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,870
started to be shared not just with the

154
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,470
FSB but with the tax laws the tax police

155
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,240
the Russian police the customs the

156
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,110
Border Patrol and so on China has one of

157
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,930
the most restrictive internet

158
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,060
communications surveillance programs in

159
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,039
the world and monitoring programs around

160
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,260
about 30,000 people are estimated to

161
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,090
work just on monitoring what is said

162
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,460
online one of the interesting things

163
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,940
that there was a public pledge on

164
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,410
security and self-discipline for the

165
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,910
Chinese Internet industry this is a

166
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,590
non-governmental body of Chinese ISPs

167
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,380
internet providers website hosts who all

168
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,780
got together and collectively said that

169
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,440
they would not allow the transmission of

170
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,760
anything that might be deemed to be

171
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,180
objectionable self-censorship to avoid

172
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,539
any possibility of economic or legal

173
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:10,740
repercussions on their companies the

174
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,490
basis of all of these things is law but

175
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,130
what we have seen is a stretching and a

176
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,139
reinterpretation of those laws to cover

177
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,639
way more than the laws were ever

178
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,590
intentionally put together for everybody

179
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,990
is saying well what could they do with

180
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,030
all this data and their answer of course

181
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:35,700
is we don't do that but wait let's talk

182
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,610
about the USA the most important act in

183
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,289
terms of surveillance in the United

184
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,880
States is the Foreign Intelligence

185
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,540
Surveillance Act the fighter Act it was

186
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:45,779
part

187
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:49,279
to 1978 but what we know about now is

188
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,040
the Patriot Act to 15 section 215 the

189
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,699
patriot act allows for the collection of

190
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:59,490
almost all data on any person who's a

191
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,670
non-us person who is reasonably expected

192
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,509
not to be on u.s. territory and

193
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:07,920
sometimes cause the light called the

194
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,740
library law because it actually allowed

195
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,120
collections of things like people's

196
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,819
medical records and what books they took

197
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:16,139
out from the library what they bought

198
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,360
from stores and these were secret orders

199
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,370
that were given and nobody could talk

200
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,899
about them you couldn't tell anybody

201
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,519
that they were being under investigation

202
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,170
so if I went to the library and took a

203
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,149
book out that had to be recorded and

204
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,339
reported to the FBI but I was never

205
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,720
allowed to know that that had happened

206
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,100
then of course we come to the FISA

207
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,189
Amendments Act of 2008 most of the

208
00:09:38,189 --> 00:09:40,529
clauses in the Patriot Act actually went

209
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:42,870
fell under a sunset clause cause to 26

210
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,629
and in 2006 it mostly went away but of

211
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:46,949
course that wasn't the end what the

212
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:48,389
government needed to do so they made a

213
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:50,670
new law and the FISA Amendments law in

214
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,399
section 702 is even more far-reaching it

215
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,199
allowed for the collection of metadata

216
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,110
from all communications and required

217
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,139
again under warrant which was repeating

218
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:05,250
warrant target less collection of data

219
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,839
that meant that you didn't have to give

220
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,879
a warrant that said my name on it you

221
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,589
gave a warrant which said a company's

222
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:12,089
name on and they were required to give

223
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:14,790
all since that information there at

224
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,709
times people say they're listening to

225
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:20,430
all our communications that is not

226
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,730
authorized under this what you're

227
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,279
hearing what you're seeing what people

228
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:31,709
are saying is well they could the fact

229
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:39,360
is they don't so under this what we

230
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,889
heard about recently due to the leaks

231
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:43,439
from Edward Snowden is the prison

232
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:45,990
program and as they proudly announces

233
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,629
the most-used program in srna in NSA

234
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:51,569
reporting it requires the collection

235
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:53,670
from companies of all metadata of all

236
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,160
calls made all email headers and so on

237
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,250
and so on and of course

238
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,810
there's they are under secret orders no

239
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,930
one can disclose that they are under

240
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,460
those orders and what's find I find

241
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,630
really interesting is that general

242
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,250
Alexander made a speech a couple of days

243
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,870
ago at a conference where he was

244
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,150
actually kind of defending some of the

245
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,880
companies in he named them and yet those

246
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,740
companies themselves are under legal

247
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,780
compulsion not to disclose that they are

248
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,670
subject to such orders and they are

249
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,100
still fighting in court to be able to

250
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,930
reveal the fact that they are subject to

251
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:33,640
such orders of course general Alexander

252
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,590
is constrained by law you'll note very

253
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:39,150
clearly that he said under this program

254
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,790
that is not authorized under this but we

255
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,950
don't know what else is yet to come and

256
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,490
of course we are free to speculate but

257
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,280
that does mean that we can also be wrong

258
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,200
we can suggest that anything is

259
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,730
happening we can suggest that they are

260
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,760
hiding alien activity or the oh the

261
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,160
lizard king and that's where conspiracy

262
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,470
theory comes from the problem is not

263
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,330
that we don't know the problem is that

264
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,990
there is no transparency so what is

265
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,810
known what do we know well first of all

266
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,700
we do know that companies are being

267
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,680
compelled by Fisk orders these

268
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,930
surveillance court orders to reveal

269
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,060
information it's very clear that

270
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,610
companies have been asked for all of the

271
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,680
core data all of the telephony metadata

272
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,870
metadata and comprehensive

273
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,520
communications information but not

274
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,250
including the content of that call now

275
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,890
it's very clear that somewhere that call

276
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,530
data is being recorded because the NSA

277
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,240
does a search they find the details they

278
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,220
can pass that to the FBI and then the

279
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,960
FBI can go and listen to the core so

280
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,330
somewhere it's being stored but under

281
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,580
this program it's not allowed to be used

282
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,730
if you go and have a look at the eff

283
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,140
apposite Ori there are there are many

284
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,240
many documents there you can take a look

285
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,500
there are hundreds of documents that

286
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,380
have also been been released about this

287
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,020
and you can see the extent of the

288
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,330
intended law has been stretched to its

289
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,540
very limits and perhaps beyond so this

290
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,110
is where we live we are also in a

291
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,100
situation where we have found that

292
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,240
not only our government's making laws

293
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,649
which weaken our communication systems

294
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:20,470
but they are actually asking for things

295
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,019
like weakening encryption systems or

296
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,790
back doors into systems now of course

297
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,529
you don't really need to weaken

298
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:29,680
encryption systems the best way to get

299
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,079
encryption data is to break the thumbs

300
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,500
of the person who owns the keys but we

301
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,709
live in a more civilized age so perhaps

302
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:41,589
we just ask for back door keys perhaps

303
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:44,620
we just ask for the underlying random

304
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,720
number generator to be created in such a

305
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,440
way that we can reasonably predict what

306
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,560
keys somebody is going to generate or

307
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,509
perhaps we just require deck direct

308
00:13:55,509 --> 00:14:01,870
access into that system it wouldn't be

309
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,940
fair to concentrate on those things

310
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,220
without mentioning the endpoint why

311
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,740
break anyone's thumbs why even ask for

312
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,800
access to a system when the state of

313
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,720
endpoint security in our world today is

314
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,930
so woefully inadequate that we find from

315
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,509
many surveys that people have no idea

316
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:21,730
about even basic security they're not

317
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,589
running AV they're not patching it

318
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:24,939
they're not putting firewalls on it

319
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:26,860
they're not running IDs they're running

320
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,240
wide open so why not just break the

321
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,220
endpoint you can do a man-in-the-middle

322
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,009
interception attack and actually that's

323
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:39,579
what's happened for some reason the UK

324
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,529
government has decided that it's ok to

325
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:43,689
compromise the security of an internet

326
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:45,610
provider in Belgium they made this

327
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,040
operation operation socialist and they

328
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,139
proudly have managed to place malware

329
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:57,459
backdoors into an ISP commercial company

330
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:00,069
in another country ostensibly an ally

331
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:02,889
and able to gain access to their

332
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:06,759
communications data not just them not

333
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:09,069
just the USA not just Germany not just

334
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:12,610
oh the India requested rinoa stands for

335
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,889
rim Nokia Apple they requested

336
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:17,439
unencrypted access to those devices or

337
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:19,029
to the communications made by those

338
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:22,540
devices and that of course leads us to

339
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,290
the exploit market zero days of

340
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,970
come valuable we've heard already that's

341
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:32,620
going to be a talk about it you know I

342
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,970
don't have a problem with people

343
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,519
disclosing companies like bhupen

344
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,100
disclosing that's a that's I think a

345
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,930
valid thing to do we need to know about

346
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,060
the security we need to know about

347
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,810
what's going on but it's being shared

348
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,399
clearly with governments and governments

349
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,110
may be using it not so that we can

350
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,970
increase our security but so that we can

351
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,250
break endpoints of those we believe to

352
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,430
be our enemies one quite amusing thing

353
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,259
of with the bhupen is if you read their

354
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,639
terms of commissions actually says that

355
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,560
no malicious data will be transmitted

356
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,470
with this program but so I don't know

357
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:10,060
what they're sharing anywho what we've

358
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,380
also seen is that the government is

359
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,889
getting into the malware business the

360
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:17,709
u.s. is always a world leader they

361
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:24,130
created a logger court sip have and it

362
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,300
could log IP addresses it could take the

363
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,060
browser idea could take the operating

364
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,680
system details it would know who's the

365
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,779
logged on user know about URLs that you

366
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:37,240
visited touch the mac address all of

367
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,389
those kind of things and they were doing

368
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:43,449
it so that they could wiretap

369
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:47,819
essentially peoples peoples computers

370
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:50,230
the german government was in on its well

371
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,690
well known for the Bundys charger and

372
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,670
the interesting thing about these things

373
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,839
is that all of these there have been

374
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:00,399
rumors flying around that the AV

375
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,380
industry was asked in some cases in

376
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,119
first in the case of magic lantern

377
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,250
certain US companies were asked not to

378
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,650
detect that was the rumor that was going

379
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,900
around other companies f-secure sophos

380
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,909
came out publicly he said we will never

381
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:14,589
not detect a piece of malware because

382
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:20,919
malware it's malware the r2d2 trojan and

383
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:24,280
the cal intrusion those ones actually

384
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,419
we're interesting because they were

385
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,309
submitted to virustotal several times so

386
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:28,780
actually a lot of Av companies already

387
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,850
detected them by the time that they were

388
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,299
in use we see other countries like

389
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:39,658
Malaysia Egypt Bahrain using fins by

390
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,930
Fisher and you will also see a

391
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,880
presentation this week which I won't

392
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,150
touch on but this is going to be about

393
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,190
companies creating now where for

394
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,810
governments it wouldn't be a

395
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,130
presentation at vbf without talking

396
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,690
about Stuxnet you all know that stuff

397
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,890
you know what it was for and I think the

398
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,360
next big thing is going to be malware

399
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,830
installed on mobile devices because

400
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,660
mobile devices are way more powerful

401
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,790
than just your desktop not in terms of

402
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,500
processing but in terms of what they can

403
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,620
do for you as a surveillance officer I

404
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,210
carry my cell phone with me wherever I

405
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,220
go it has my location on it has my

406
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,380
contact on it it has my email on it it

407
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,930
has my social media activity on it not

408
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,640
only that but in the future it may well

409
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,860
have my medical information on it if I

410
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,510
have an implanted device it might be

411
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,950
monitoring my blood pressure it might be

412
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,610
monitoring my heart rate and you can

413
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,840
imagine that with something that

414
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,970
powerful the downsides of having malware

415
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,240
on making it unstable or spying on it is

416
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,870
also devastating so we are blurring the

417
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,790
boundaries between legality and

418
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,800
something outside of that but we're also

419
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,060
blurring the boundaries between

420
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,030
something that is military and something

421
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,440
that is civilian there is no military

422
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,150
internet and there is no civilian

423
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,610
internet there is just the internet but

424
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,780
we have blurred the boundaries by

425
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,260
talking about things like cyber warfare

426
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,930
weaponized malware coerced non-detection

427
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,830
and we have also got to a situation

428
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,600
where we have over classified and

429
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,940
created unnecessary secrecy around what

430
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,930
it is that we're doing with

431
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:18,020
communications data and so if we're in a

432
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:23,450
situation where we have too much of the

433
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,550
military influence and not enough of the

434
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,900
civilian influence or the legal

435
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,850
influence then there is a problem and

436
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,400
just think of it it's this way most

437
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,560
terrorists are civilians so in the

438
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,950
military mind every civilian is a

439
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,370
potential terrorist and if every

440
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,790
civilian is a potential terrorist then

441
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,640
we have a problem because we have to

442
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,690
militarize

443
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,000
the internet we have to militarize our

444
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,759
communications and so I question the

445
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:01,309
proportionality of the response that has

446
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,889
been given to this what is our

447
00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:05,509
effectiveness relative to the actual

448
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:08,330
spend that we've spent billions of

449
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,730
dollars on creating these global systems

450
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,370
of surveillance and yet we spend very

451
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,620
very little in terms in real terms and

452
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,830
public education in security in public

453
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:23,509
education generally and I think the way

454
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:25,429
to reduce terrorism is far better to

455
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:28,460
increase education than perhaps create

456
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,440
huge surveillance networks and make a

457
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,659
bigger bigger haystack so that we can

458
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:37,039
try to find more needles we've also seen

459
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,649
this phenomenon of leaks and leakers and

460
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:41,120
I really won't touch too much on this

461
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,610
but we have a tendency to create a

462
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,289
person a cult of personality around

463
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:47,539
leakers and leakers it was very

464
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:49,309
interesting to me the way that the media

465
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:52,220
moved from talking about the leaks and

466
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,809
what the content of the leaks in that

467
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:55,190
we're under surveillance to subtly

468
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,590
talking about Edward Snowden as a person

469
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,850
and who his girlfriend was and where he

470
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,730
was going and chelsea manning and her

471
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,850
issues and julian assange and whether

472
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,759
he's a journalist or not and that's

473
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:10,309
generated at just a distrust in the

474
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:12,230
hacker community the government's do not

475
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,320
trust us as technical technicians

476
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,620
anymore and we've also lost trust in our

477
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,269
government people should not be afraid

478
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:22,669
of their government government should be

479
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:26,539
afraid of their people we're seeing

480
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:28,100
restrictions on the press if the

481
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,070
government is the only person who only

482
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,679
body that can decide who is a journalist

483
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,269
then you do not have freedom of the

484
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:39,559
press and due process is subverted so

485
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,059
what are the public thinking about this

486
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:42,710
stuff what the public's say well we did

487
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,809
a survey because I could guess and I

488
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:47,149
could tell you I what I think but we did

489
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:49,070
an actual survey and I asked people just

490
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,840
in the United States and we ask them

491
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,090
some questions I said isn't okay for my

492
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,950
government secretly to monitor all of

493
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,570
our you communications Barry minuses

494
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,690
only people in the United States

495
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,919
eighteen percent of people thought that

496
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,629
that was okay but I changed the question

497
00:22:02,629 --> 00:22:04,610
slightly then I asked them do you think

498
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,409
it's okay for the government to secretly

499
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,070
monitor the

500
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,830
munications of foreign nationals such as

501
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,860
people from Iran or China and suddenly

502
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:18,769
the jump is significant I then asked is

503
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:20,090
it ok for the monett the government to

504
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,440
one of the communication if they tell me

505
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,659
that I monitor being monitored and a few

506
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:26,149
more people thought but still less than

507
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:27,620
thirty five percent of people thought

508
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,009
that that was ok and then I asked the

509
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:32,240
big question well do you think this

510
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,630
helps present prevent terrorism and a

511
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,220
significant proportion of people think

512
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,409
that it does and this is the problem

513
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:41,210
because we think that everybody else is

514
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,009
the criminal but I'm okay and I should

515
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:44,750
be fine and I shouldn't be subject to it

516
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,190
but when you think about that that's

517
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,230
just logically false it can't be that

518
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,929
way we can't have a world where I am the

519
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:54,230
only good guy and you're all bad guys so

520
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,580
we're walking around in a situation

521
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,200
where we don't even know if there's a

522
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,700
problem because we assume that

523
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,460
everything we're doing is okay but does

524
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,169
this set a precedent for other nations

525
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:06,559
if we do this what will they do what

526
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,120
about the hostile States the so-called

527
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,549
states that we we are enemies of right

528
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:12,500
now or states that might be seeking to

529
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,509
attack us we've heard nothing but China

530
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:16,940
until these leaks came out everything

531
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,250
was China and apt an attack and cyber

532
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,490
and we're hearing all of this stuff and

533
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,730
yet we are doing things that are

534
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:29,360
behaving just as badly and I question

535
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,340
whether this creates a situation where

536
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,870
we actually reduce our capacity to be

537
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,730
able to work internationally with with

538
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,379
colleagues across the globe because we

539
00:23:36,379 --> 00:23:38,210
can't see them in the same light that we

540
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:42,649
see ourselves this leads to a public

541
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:45,940
self-restraint and self-censorship a

542
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,059
chilling of our democracy and it creates

543
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:53,090
distrust of companies a general hora de

544
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,700
trust that the sex the SEC industry the

545
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,259
communications our internet service

546
00:23:57,259 --> 00:23:58,669
providers the cloud providers you know

547
00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:00,289
we were having good conversations before

548
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:02,179
all these leaks happen we were talking

549
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:04,309
about should we be encrypting data in

550
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,190
the cloud should we be securing our

551
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:10,820
endpoints yes and now we're not talking

552
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,019
about the cloud only war because we

553
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:13,730
don't want to put our data in the United

554
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,129
States because it might be surveilled by

555
00:24:16,129 --> 00:24:17,539
some government so we leave it on

556
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,279
unpatched machines which are open to any

557
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,820
attacker anywhere

558
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,760
so we're missing the point and social

559
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,050
media has become something that

560
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,610
governments have now jumped on we

561
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,320
already know that who we can create all

562
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,230
the connections but the government are

563
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,390
using that as well so there are

564
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,280
commercial and economic impacts to what

565
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,080
we're doing people lose trust in systems

566
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,340
they don't start buying them they don't

567
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,590
use them as much and we step backwards

568
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,570
and it affects the ability of companies

569
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,910
in countries where surveillance is

570
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,040
rampant to actually do business with the

571
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,710
rest of the world nobody wants to live

572
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,830
in a box but there is this myth that

573
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:57,580
people say well I've got nothing to hide

574
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,620
so I don't need any privacy what is

575
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,930
might be truer to say is innocent people

576
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,460
have done nothing criminal that they

577
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,850
want to hide but when it comes to you've

578
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,380
worked on a new invention or you're

579
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,090
writing a new book or your sexual

580
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,310
appetites or your preferences in

581
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,440
literature those are things that we

582
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,200
choose to control and so we asked people

583
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,570
if you've done nothing wrong you have

584
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,430
nothing to fear unfortunately so many

585
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,260
people think that that's okay but it's

586
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,000
false on its face because nobody wants

587
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,370
to live like David Blaine in a box the

588
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,570
revelations about government

589
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,070
surveillance in Snowden leaks has had a

590
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,450
negative effect on the government's

591
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,430
ability to print prevent terrorism do

592
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:40,130
you agree forty percent of people would

593
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:43,940
agree but also people would agree that

594
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,470
there are less trusting of technology

595
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,140
companies but one fine thing one final

596
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,360
thing that I found redeeming is that if

597
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,130
a company would take a stand and

598
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,700
publicly state that we're not going to

599
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,250
submit to these without fighting bearing

600
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,870
in mind that these are under law and you

601
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,270
have a legal right to answer any legal

602
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,440
document in the court people thought

603
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,700
that that would be something that they

604
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,590
would like companies to do if you can't

605
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,030
see the screen actually seventy-four

606
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,310
percent of people would would prefer to

607
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,230
work with a company that would stand

608
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,680
against unlimited government access so

609
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,790
what about us as an industry where are

610
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:26,600
we where is the trust between our

611
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,880
researchers what about researchers in

612
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,610
different nation states how about the

613
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,810
trust within the sort of the wider

614
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,400
security industry you know we as

615
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,070
seen in the wider security industry with

616
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,290
a great deal of suspicion people don't

617
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:42,020
like AV they don't like what we do they

618
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,760
don't think it works properly they think

619
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,930
we're selling a false solution we all

620
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,550
know the answer to that we all know that

621
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,020
we're setting the bar higher and higher

622
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,700
for an attacker and the attacker has

623
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,440
unlimited amounts of time and they can

624
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,470
put a lot of effort into creating new

625
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,030
pieces of malware that aren't detected

626
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,470
by our defenses but the fact that they

627
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,940
have to do that and they have to spend

628
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,920
cycles and have to work on that does

629
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,330
mean that we have raised the bar that

630
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,980
there isn't just one trojan that works

631
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,770
in the whole of the world now i'm not

632
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,310
saying that we don't have a role to play

633
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:15,560
we have the trust of millions there is

634
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,260
no government in the world that has an

635
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,250
agent on every desktop but this industry

636
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,700
almost does we have an agent on almost

637
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,220
every desktop between us the security of

638
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,040
millions is in our hands and so we have

639
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,990
a responsibility to decide what we will

640
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,250
do with the data that we could

641
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,760
potentially extract with that power what

642
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,590
about the use of demographic data that

643
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,140
we have in our licensing databases what

644
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,310
about the information we have about

645
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:48,110
what's infecting somebody somewhere the

646
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,270
NSA has stated through general Alexander

647
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,130
that it wants to have more open links

648
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:56,630
with the industry my question is will we

649
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:01,790
have a choice will that give us a

650
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,880
competitive disadvantage if we are

651
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,920
compelled to share and what about

652
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,280
sharing this industry was founded on

653
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,830
trust I know you you know me we trust

654
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,190
each other we'll share samples maybe you

655
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,480
trust my company and you'll share

656
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,510
samples with my company but now that we

657
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,680
know that the government is in the

658
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,750
malware game how do we trust those

659
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,030
people how do we trust researchers who

660
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,590
are working for government how do we

661
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,900
trust researchers in countries where we

662
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,520
know that those companies will be

663
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,160
subject to court orders requiring them

664
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,480
to release information to their

665
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,590
governments what about vulnerabilities

666
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,500
do we do we disclose vulnerabilities

667
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,080
knowledge

668
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,970
to a company that we know may sell that

669
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:53,419
to a government we're in a brave new

670
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:58,120
world what about the threat intelligence

671
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:02,630
our old ethical frameworks were based on

672
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,970
personal relationship we're way beyond

673
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,830
that this industry is less cohesive as a

674
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,740
whole there are far more people in it

675
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,630
there are more companies there are

676
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,269
different sets of ethics so what are the

677
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:16,010
modern ethical considerations that we

678
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:19,450
have to face can we do we agree on a

679
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,399
unified set of ethics in this industry

680
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,399
on what we will agree to do whether we

681
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:28,130
will agree or not to detect malware now

682
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,230
if you want to talk about coerced

683
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,510
detection to me that seemed to really

684
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:35,720
done way to do it if I was a cop and I

685
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,889
wanted to create some malware that

686
00:29:36,889 --> 00:29:38,389
wasn't detected I wouldn't do it by

687
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:40,700
going to Niko and saying Rico don't

688
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,429
detect this thing and then going to you

689
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:44,659
know issue and saying easy doesn't it

690
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:46,909
take this thing and then going to your

691
00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:48,590
ego at saying Igor don't you take this

692
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:51,529
thing 50 companies all not detecting the

693
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:53,330
one thing in different nation states all

694
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,519
over the world it's not practical you'd

695
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,500
do what everyone else does you'd write

696
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,059
some code and you'd submit it to virus

697
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:02,539
total a bunch of times and then you'd

698
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:05,360
see when it doesn't get detected but

699
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,250
still we face the possibility and I have

700
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,399
been asked in person many times have you

701
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,990
been asked by law enforcement not to

702
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:15,080
detect certain things well where do we

703
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,419
draw the line can we create a unified

704
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:20,389
voice on this what do we do about you

705
00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:22,159
what do we do about all the user data

706
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,860
that we have what happens when we're

707
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,590
compelled to share that do we just say

708
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:30,350
good luck you go first fight this in the

709
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:34,549
court you know I'm not suggesting that

710
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:41,269
you'd be a hero okay the law is there we

711
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:43,940
operate legally under certain legal

712
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:49,519
frameworks my question is when we know

713
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:52,039
that something goes against the general

714
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:54,950
ethics of our industry or if I can't

715
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,299
look at myself in the mirror in the

716
00:30:56,299 --> 00:30:59,330
morning am I willing to fight in court

717
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,580
against having to do that and you may

718
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,229
lose

719
00:31:02,229 --> 00:31:06,049
but at least you'll know you fought the

720
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:07,429
interesting thing reading through some

721
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:09,229
of the documents is the not one single

722
00:31:09,229 --> 00:31:12,649
company previous to these leaks had

723
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:16,669
fought a Fisk order not one they simply

724
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:18,259
accepted them and gave up the data

725
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:20,389
because it's cheaper to do that and it's

726
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:26,599
easier to do that economically so we

727
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:29,929
have to be pragmatic okay we can't be

728
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:34,159
you know superheroes perhaps we still

729
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,339
need to be able to fall within the

730
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:39,139
legislation and compliance that we at

731
00:31:39,139 --> 00:31:43,549
with that we are under we still have to

732
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:45,829
have a willingness to work with law

733
00:31:45,829 --> 00:31:48,319
enforcement this can't this come to this

734
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:50,389
this industry is long known for its

735
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:52,459
links with law enforcement we work very

736
00:31:52,459 --> 00:31:54,109
well with law enforcement in bringing

737
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:56,869
down the criminal gangs and we trust

738
00:31:56,869 --> 00:31:59,899
them to do that with what with the data

739
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:01,909
to use it in the right way to bring down

740
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:04,549
criminals Bob burles is here somewhere

741
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:05,929
he's going to be talking at some point

742
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:07,729
this week you know I've known Bob a long

743
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:09,589
time he's worked with with his work with

744
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:10,939
the police in England for a long time

745
00:32:10,939 --> 00:32:13,399
we've had good links because we know

746
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:15,589
that we can trust what he's going to do

747
00:32:15,589 --> 00:32:22,249
with that data but what about

748
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:26,809
cross-border issues what happens when

749
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:28,939
the police are in another country are

750
00:32:28,939 --> 00:32:31,279
you less willing to share what we know

751
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,129
that malware and Internet crime is a

752
00:32:34,129 --> 00:32:37,299
cross-border problem there's no just

753
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:40,279
Brazilian internet there's no just us a

754
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:43,639
internet its global and the gangs that

755
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:46,429
operate malware our global gangs so we

756
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:47,839
need to be able to collaborate across

757
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,609
borders but knowing that the data that

758
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:53,109
we share is somehow being used properly

759
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:55,219
we're seeing a lot of other things and

760
00:32:55,219 --> 00:32:56,659
one thing I would say and I've found it

761
00:32:56,659 --> 00:32:58,129
to be effective is to actually get

762
00:32:58,129 --> 00:32:59,929
involved at a government level if you

763
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:02,959
can find out who the people are in your

764
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:05,389
in your area in your district who are in

765
00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:07,489
government and work with them when

766
00:33:07,489 --> 00:33:09,589
there's legislation being created and

767
00:33:09,589 --> 00:33:12,409
shaped I spent a lot of time last year

768
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:14,059
working on the stopper bill with our

769
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:16,400
Congress person going through and high

770
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,270
lighting the areas which were

771
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,250
problematic for our industry and for the

772
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,130
public in general we can work with these

773
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,300
people and the problem is that

774
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,280
legislators just don't know what you

775
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,590
know and we can throw arms up and say oh

776
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,760
well the government's going to do this

777
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,310
anyway no they're not because they want

778
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,840
to keep power because they want to get

779
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,610
voted in again and if enough people are

780
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,250
telling them this is wrong then they

781
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,890
won't do it and the other thing I want

782
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,560
to say is just don't make things worse

783
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,180
I've seen an encroachment in there and

784
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,250
you can argue the benefits and the value

785
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,280
of this of the phenomenon of us bundling

786
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,800
with advertising and with toolbars and

787
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,850
things that are perhaps not quite

788
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,200
related to what our central mission

789
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,080
which is removing and killing malware

790
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,020
let's try to do that in a way that makes

791
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,540
sense for our customers and isn't just

792
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,830
about money in the bottom line so I have

793
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,590
some questions for us rather than the

794
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,000
traditional where you will ask me

795
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,590
questions I'm going to ask you some

796
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,550
questions and they're going to be

797
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,870
rhetorical so you don't have to answer

798
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,120
but I want us to think about them over

799
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,000
the next few days while we're here where

800
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,860
will this industry be in 10 years what

801
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,860
will we be doing we all we still even

802
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,820
exist and under what compulsion of law

803
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:39,320
will we exist what is the future for us

804
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,770
in this strange new world what role do

805
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:49,310
we want to play in creating a more

806
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:53,389
secure world and in that how are we

807
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:56,300
going to ensure that we can continue the

808
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,210
central mission of detecting malware

809
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:03,890
threats and reducing the problem how do

810
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,900
we think about system design in such a

811
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,290
way that it perhaps makes it impossible

812
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:11,390
for us to share easily such types of

813
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:14,600
data can we create separated systems

814
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,330
that don't reveal the communications of

815
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:20,570
our users can we ensure that we are

816
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,570
unable to comply perhaps by system

817
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:26,120
design you know I think we have to live

818
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,150
an examined life we can't just blindly

819
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,200
plunge on and

820
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,820
that everything will be okay we have to

821
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,800
look at ourselves in the mirror every

822
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,910
morning and not just see more white hair

823
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,770
but actually see something that we can

824
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,349
live with if my answers frighten you

825
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,970
Vincent then you should cease asking

826
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,150
scary questions so let's ask the

827
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:51,170
questions before we need the answers the

828
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,550
presentations that you will see this

829
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,890
week I believe will start to answer many

830
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,200
of those questions but we have to get

831
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,250
away from just thinking about technology

832
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:04,640
into thinking about us as citizens in a

833
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,000
digital age thank you everybody and

834
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,810
welcome to Berlin this tomorrow will be

835
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:14,780
the 23rd anniversary of the

836
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,750
