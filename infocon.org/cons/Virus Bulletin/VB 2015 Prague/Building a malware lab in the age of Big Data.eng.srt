1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
we're just waiting for you whoever you

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:08,309
are we're waiting for you all right well

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,500
without any further ado I'd like to

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,990
welcome Vanya who's going to talk about

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,000
the subjects actually two subjects very

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,340
dear to my heart ship malware and big

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,320
data over to you Vanya Thank You Morton

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,609
it's great to see you it's such a large

9
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,380
number like you haven't expected such a

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,539
turn out on a Friday last session ever

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,730
before the keynote but I guess you guys

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,529
are keen to listen to what costing has

13
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,899
to say so you might as well hear what we

14
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,850
have to say here as well so my name is

15
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,950
Vanya i work for HP security research

16
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,450
I've been around the industry for some

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,180
time that you can see by the number of

18
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,070
gray hair or the rather de by the lack

19
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,820
of it so what are we going to talk about

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,300
so before before we kind of deep dig

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,829
deeper into what I wanted to present let

22
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,149
me give you a little bit of a concept

23
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,090
first I have to admit something so I'm a

24
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,140
pretty lazy guy right so and I think it

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,960
comes from there my old the kind of time

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,670
mad when I was a student in school and

27
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,920
in university I usually had basically

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,350
two phases of high prepared my exam the

29
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,720
first one was ah there's plenty of time

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,330
right the second one is ah he's too late

31
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,259
already so so basically very very

32
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,799
similar very similar to the deadline for

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,380
the vb conference when i started working

34
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,590
HP I got this small team of researchers

35
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,640
to to kind of lead let's say and then

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,369
when I arrived that we started thinking

37
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:44,250
about and working on on kind of putting

38
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,009
together some systems and processes and

39
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,409
building this kind of Amalur malva

40
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,799
marvel lab and and then we realized as

41
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,860
we kept receiving some samples from some

42
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,250
of our users that many big like fortune

43
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,860
100 companies and I even the smaller

44
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,500
ones are thinking and considering or

45
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,659
building their own kind of kind of thing

46
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,340
so we I try to connect like a good thing

47
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,860
that the deadline for the vb conference

48
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,000
and the things that we are actually

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,890
working on and I thought why don't we

50
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,810
write a paper which will be targeted

51
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,930
more to smaller teams which was our team

52
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,410
rather than like the overall big huge AV

53
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,480
labs like most of the people here in the

54
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,680
room already have but we had some unique

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,180
let's say well there were a lot of

56
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,340
challenges and we have also unique

57
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,260
opportunities and I think what our

58
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,390
biggest opportunity is that as you

59
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,730
probably all know HP doesn't really have

60
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,330
a Navy product so instead of being kind

61
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,380
of tied to a particular technology what

62
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,870
you old guys have your own these

63
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,360
different malware detection languages

64
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,540
you're all the infrastructure that you

65
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,790
develop over time we could actually take

66
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,000
a kind of fresh look and try to see what

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,230
can we do with relatively small team and

68
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,820
pretty limited budget so essentially we

69
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,239
are at the point or we were at the point

70
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,630
like when many AV companies used to be

71
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,180
so perhaps that the talk is not going to

72
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,280
be as much as the big data is going to

73
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,750
be a little bit more about actually

74
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,970
building a mother lab because by the

75
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,140
time like I said by the time I submitted

76
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,060
the paper i was hoping we'll have all

77
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,040
our systems in place so i can give you

78
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,989
all sorts of ideal for what's going on

79
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:39,390
and all the stats and how much data we

80
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,519
are collecting but unfortunately by the

81
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,250
time i started writing the paper the

82
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,070
systems were not just yet in place so

83
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,200
and i thought ah there's still plenty of

84
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,769
time right and by the time that the

85
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,549
presentation was looming I thought we'll

86
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:58,799
have plenty of data obviously we have

87
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,750
three four months to put everything

88
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,970
together install everything we have all

89
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,209
the data right turns out it's too late

90
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:12,390
now so we are basically at the point of

91
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,400
if you remember give you a little bit of

92
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,488
a history as well some people would

93
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:19,260
recognize very few people to recognize

94
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,010
this face Graham Cluley may be made

95
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,780
three guys from so forth so this is the

96
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,210
surface labs when I actually joined so

97
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:27,540
first

98
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,450
lab right so what you have here is they

99
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,210
were like I think four or five of us

100
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,820
working in a very nice building in

101
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,820
Oxford and we essentially had two

102
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,350
machines each running dos and we

103
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,720
processed about 300 samples a month

104
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,780
which meant that we would get the

105
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,520
collection which were exchanged monthly

106
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,590
on the first few days of the month we

107
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,730
would quickly quickly write the

108
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,440
detection and then we would have plenty

109
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,170
of time to enjoy after that to the end

110
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,630
of the month alright so those were the

111
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,430
good old times and you can see some of

112
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,230
the trace where we could use the floppy

113
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,570
disk when we because we had to destroy

114
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,660
them it's a separate the lab is a

115
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,760
physically separated environment it's

116
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,430
isolated from the network at the time no

117
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,640
internet access whatsoever so but it was

118
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,470
actually pretty pretty pretty nice place

119
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,650
to work at now is obviously a little bit

120
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,780
more stressful for for especially people

121
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,810
who have to work but if you think about

122
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,240
those small numbers they kept the Kree

123
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,930
increasing over time so sometimes i

124
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:38,160
think in 99 I or maybe 2000 I saw this

125
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,800
presentation by by David chess and Steve

126
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,900
white from IBM who were just about to be

127
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,470
acquired by by symantec or some of the

128
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,210
technology about the digital immune

129
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,450
system so the digital immune system is

130
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,190
something which I consider to be like

131
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,960
come on guys this is science fiction

132
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,130
clearly you have some agents on the on

133
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,780
the endpoints you have some

134
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,420
administrator tools running there and

135
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,490
you have information flow in two ways

136
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,710
from the central control like a unit

137
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,320
which basically analyze this malware and

138
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,240
creates new detection and there is the

139
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,730
whole feedback loop between the people

140
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,730
who are using the software and actual

141
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,500
producer of the AV software and so I am

142
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,660
fairly sure that most of the people now

143
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,730
and most of the companies actually have

144
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,340
a pretty similar model of working for

145
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,680
their products instead of the analysis

146
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,900
center we have the cloud we have

147
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,210
automated analysis machines we have all

148
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,220
sorts of scanning rigs and things like

149
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,300
that and so that

150
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,639
in two thousand and I I was thinking and

151
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,560
it will never happen but yes indeed it

152
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,259
actually did happen and if you look at

153
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:50,479
the kind of obviously we all know every

154
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,870
test stat the number of mother kept

155
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,870
growing over years and it's this year it

156
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,970
kind of stabilized I hope that means we

157
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,310
are doing a better job both the vendors

158
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,229
of the operating system and the vendors

159
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:07,159
of Av of the kind of developers of the

160
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:09,110
heavy product so i think it's going to

161
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,919
stabilize around 500 samples a day five

162
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:16,629
hundred thousand samples a day of course

163
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:21,770
so this is the kind of number that we I

164
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,729
was pretty ambitious when i joined HP

165
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:27,500
and and that was my idea is like if

166
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,240
everybody's processing those samples

167
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,680
then if you really want to be serious

168
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,810
about model research you want to be able

169
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,229
to have this capacity and then like we

170
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:39,590
said people people start coming we have

171
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,139
our internal team that does the kind of

172
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:44,539
man i say internal there's the internal

173
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:46,789
IT team inside HP that deals with

174
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:49,819
malware incidents and so they are very

175
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:53,719
much a good model customer of or model

176
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:56,210
of the team that would like to build a

177
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,759
malware research facility such as like

178
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,930
the virus lab so that was that was like

179
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,069
history and contacts now the next few

180
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,500
things i would like to cover our kind of

181
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,900
work love workflow and some of the

182
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,150
components that we need to have in a

183
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,270
kind of successful lab some of the

184
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,550
design principles and kind of

185
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,740
recommendations that we came across

186
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,529
during our kind of Investigation and

187
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:27,409
kind of finished with the with the

188
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:32,240
summary hopefully that's it so even if

189
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,809
we when you started looking at the lab I

190
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,669
kind of tried to look like every single

191
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,190
component what we need like servers this

192
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,860
and that various scanner shrieks oh I

193
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,079
put everything on like one Vizio slide

194
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:47,870
and then I thought I realized this is a

195
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,260
bit complicated so I kind of went bottom

196
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,670
up and then top down so this is I guess

197
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,310
down like big units or what we need to

198
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,250
have like acquisition of course we need

199
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,120
to get our sample somehow we need to be

200
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,390
able to analyze it in some kind of group

201
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,820
then we need to have people who are

202
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,410
actually going to interact with the

203
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,750
system so we need some kind of end user

204
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,140
system facility some kind of portal we

205
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,900
need to have a workflow that will kind

206
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,730
of automate everything from the process

207
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,620
of the acquisition of the samples to the

208
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,310
actual storage and potentially output of

209
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,210
course we need place where to store that

210
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,770
in the storage and then we need some

211
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,930
kind of auxiliary modules which I really

212
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,280
couldn't place in any particular

213
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,740
category category of these kind of

214
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,190
really important part and then I have

215
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,500
like I have partner interfaces and food

216
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,570
producers because one of one of the

217
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,340
things that we do is I think Oleg

218
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,640
mentioned and John we have the like a

219
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,410
sweat intelligence-sharing product

220
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,270
called thread central so that's one of

221
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,940
the things we would like to or we wanted

222
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,840
to incorporate in our design so we'll

223
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,790
kind of drill down slowly butt slide by

224
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,840
slide into like every category so first

225
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,110
one is the sample acquisition if you

226
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,760
really know so you have really two

227
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,600
choices first choices which I thought it

228
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,840
was right choice at the beginning was do

229
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,610
everything yourself and this is what

230
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,130
every mother company and every every

231
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,690
company did create your own spam traps

232
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:33,370
create your own honey pots crawlers kind

233
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,630
of systems but they all require

234
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,970
development time they'll require

235
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,280
developers and they all require some

236
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,970
stability to a point I I thought that if

237
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,150
we if we ourselves didn't have any

238
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,810
malware samples or URLs that our own

239
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,600
then it would would be no it wouldn't be

240
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,330
nice it wouldn't be fair that we start

241
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,190
and try to join the rest of the AV

242
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,910
industry start exchanging samples in url

243
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,100
so on a kind of daily basis likely or

244
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,030
you all guys too so the other the other

245
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,529
possible ways is

246
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:11,829
it basically just well pay pay for

247
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:13,810
access to some of the model repositories

248
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,430
and that was the situation more or less

249
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:20,920
why not when I joined so and I think I

250
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,509
think it's worth mentioning with those

251
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:27,100
partner feeds there are also there are

252
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,439
informal or formal mailing lists and

253
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,689
there are various mechanism around those

254
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:33,939
lists that have frameworks such as

255
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:36,759
malvel information sharing platform misp

256
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:40,499
which is used by many certs and

257
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:44,110
different companies that actually

258
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,600
exchanged informations about malware

259
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,730
samples and mulberry incidents it's

260
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,350
quite an interesting framework that it

261
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,470
is open source I think it's by developed

262
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:59,110
by Luxembourg third so after the the

263
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,149
acquisition system clearly wife after we

264
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:02,800
had those samples we need to be able to

265
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,230
analyze them you know we can have

266
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,019
various automated analysis system both

267
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,319
dynamic and Static so we need to make a

268
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:14,290
decision on or try to make a decision

269
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,309
and store some data in the database so

270
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:20,350
we need to have a scanning system we

271
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,629
need to have like automated analysis

272
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:25,959
system for like dynamic analysis URLs

273
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:28,779
and how we analyze the URL feed as they

274
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:30,579
come we need to be able to see whether

275
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:32,889
they actually malicious or not so we

276
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:34,629
need to be able to confirm and simply

277
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,360
not act on the day on the flow of mother

278
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:44,110
samples as deka is the coming in so

279
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,149
static analysis workflow it typically

280
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:50,860
involves anything that is done to the

281
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,689
sample except running the sample it

282
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,699
doesn't involve that so I thought okay

283
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:56,649
so if you start analyzing the user you

284
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:58,779
authenticate first you upload your you

285
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,509
get the sample somehow the sample has to

286
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:03,759
be stored to the storage and it will

287
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,649
just run two things it would be scanned

288
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:07,689
with anthem Alvers a group of

289
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:12,069
anti-malarial scanners and done some

290
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:13,959
static methods such as extracting

291
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,929
strings the usual thing all the checks

292
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,029
sons will be calculated some fuzzy

293
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:21,250
Texans would be calculated I was hoping

294
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:21,910
to him

295
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,450
mentor include Jones modification on

296
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,330
Neil themes as well so we had all sorts

297
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,240
of ideas of what we can do and then

298
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,920
after everything is done of course we're

299
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,660
going to save those so we can later use

300
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:39,580
it for clustering and analytics same

301
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,040
with kind of dynamic analysis we kind of

302
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,410
start we submit the sample there's some

303
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,690
pre-processing happening we restored the

304
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,150
analysis environment we start monitoring

305
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,150
those are the usual thing and and you

306
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,130
guys are pretty much familiar with this

307
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,930
but this is just like for the reference

308
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,730
of the people who already don't have

309
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,530
their own lab so just to understand

310
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:03,280
what's going on like I said end user

311
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,270
systems our our team is very much we all

312
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,580
like to work from home so we don't work

313
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,380
from a note from an office and so we

314
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,360
need to have like a center of facility

315
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,390
connecting through the VPN where we

316
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,100
would access our research and

317
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,830
intelligence portal and and from that

318
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,320
portal we will be able to access all

319
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,480
this automated systems even the manual

320
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,570
systems running on most likely remember

321
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,830
and so we will be able to to to access

322
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,060
that so those are those are the

323
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,630
important ones you need to have as well

324
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,470
so the big data actually if you think

325
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,560
about just five hundred thousand samples

326
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,350
a day I think I calculated and I wrote

327
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,210
in a paper maybe I miscalculated but

328
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,250
it's only before storing sample I think

329
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,030
you need about 17 terabytes space a year

330
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,530
if the sample average sample size about

331
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,470
500 k let's say so it's it's a pretty

332
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,380
big kind of storage requirement and

333
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,230
that's only for the samples so even if

334
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,950
HP is a hardware vendor we do have to

335
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,970
pay for our internal hardware and so we

336
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,410
kind of have to share it with few other

337
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,300
teams so we have to be pretty pretty

338
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,210
careful how we spend it so in addition

339
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,850
to that if you think about okay so 500k

340
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,470
per sample is not that big but what

341
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,450
about all the other data all this kind

342
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,280
of scanners results rescanning results

343
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,080
dynamic analysis results I think

344
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,090
kind of it if i understand it it gets to

345
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,300
about 100 megabytes per / file / sample

346
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,690
so that's that's quite a large amount of

347
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:51,940
data to store we had we contacted wanted

348
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,800
like did the guys from because we are

349
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,110
also using coo coo sign books and we

350
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,150
contacted one of the developers and one

351
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,830
of the guys from Mighty our team was

352
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:04,690
very ambitious and he decided to that we

353
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,680
took he told the developer that we gonna

354
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,480
most likely build a system for 5 million

355
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,220
samples every day and it was like oh

356
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:18,580
wait a little bit too ambitious there

357
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,230
are some auxiliary resistance we need to

358
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,180
have we need to have a week he where we

359
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,930
can store our kind of documents or

360
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,120
internal documentation we need our tools

361
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,460
repository tools that we build for our

362
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,440
personal analysis needs to be stored

363
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,810
somewhere they need to be controlled in

364
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,810
source control systems we need to have

365
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,730
systems for authentication and access

366
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,100
rights we need to have systems for

367
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,100
requesting analysis from from other

368
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,260
internal and external team so if you

369
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,460
think about there are actually many

370
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,770
boxes and and that was the kind of

371
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,800
eventually I didn't even write or didn't

372
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,140
put in all the links between various

373
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,840
various systems that are required

374
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,480
otherwise it'll be just like a mesh of

375
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,060
system which which we couldn't be able

376
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,770
to see but this was the kind of image

377
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:09,400
that I came came first and then I had to

378
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,010
change and I c2c and sort various system

379
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:19,240
and boxes into like high level groups so

380
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,609
and then I was thinking like how do I

381
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:24,240
approach what what are the faces of of

382
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,199
implementation of something like this

383
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:29,830
and and came across a tool that's often

384
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,660
and frequently used in some of the kind

385
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,600
of psychological and HR people like to

386
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,250
use this like if you don't know what to

387
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,770
do just put it in a pyramid or something

388
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,760
like that so so I put it in a pyramid of

389
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,440
of am a slow kind of hierarchy and so

390
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,200
you have like

391
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,500
okay that the most common needs needs to

392
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,889
be satisfied first so we first we need

393
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:56,990
to have an individual research systems

394
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,630
which we did more or less when i joined

395
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,580
then the next level of sophistication is

396
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,470
okay let's have some acquisition love

397
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,690
samples let's hit the storage and then

398
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,960
let's start to share the information and

399
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,870
including those samples then we should

400
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,090
build those automated analysis systems

401
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,570
we ant farms all the work flow around it

402
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,490
because usually you have disparate

403
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,049
systems and you need to be able to

404
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:23,210
somehow connect those systems so they

405
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,340
can work together and talk to one to

406
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,580
each other so workflow is already pretty

407
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,440
sophisticated I would say and then

408
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,480
blessing now that you have this huge

409
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,389
amounts of data plug in some of the sort

410
00:18:35,389 --> 00:18:38,870
of HP's product we have like a

411
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,730
high-performance big data database

412
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:46,010
called Vertica and we also have we also

413
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,590
have something called Idol which is like

414
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,100
a search engine equivalent that that

415
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,860
allows you to store unstructured

416
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,350
semi-structured data set such a JSON

417
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,419
blob and then make some prediction based

418
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:01,340
on on later so there's like a machine

419
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,559
learning tool as well so these are the

420
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,139
top level and then you know once we do

421
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:08,450
that we can just keep adding new stuff

422
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,899
so that's that's the whole idea so some

423
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:14,899
of the principles and then when I kind

424
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:17,269
of realized that I I wanted to kind of

425
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:19,429
learn more about how we develop what are

426
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:21,519
the kind of development principles and

427
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:24,500
develop and then I came across I think a

428
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,880
long time ago I listen to a presentation

429
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,179
from Alistair Coburn who is one of the

430
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:31,610
kind of father of a child programming

431
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,500
and I thought okay so there's an agile

432
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,470
manifesto for for development well is

433
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,139
there like a 144 in like systems

434
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:42,850
engineering and indeed somebody from IBM

435
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,639
created an agile manifesto for systems

436
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:49,130
development and then I kind of look at

437
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,690
it and it's like yeah we really want to

438
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,799
do something along those lines so so

439
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,990
there are some principles such as there

440
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,940
always be changing requirements is like

441
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,799
when I arrived at the requirements for

442
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,970
the labs were

443
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,650
like pretty different than what they are

444
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,930
at the moment we would like to have like

445
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,660
short development cycles because when we

446
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,580
start booting actually start putting

447
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,770
building the lab together we had to

448
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,990
contract somebody so they haven't

449
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,510
reported back to us for some time so we

450
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,100
haven't actually closed the kind of

451
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,080
feedback loop from the developer to us

452
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,290
who are the users of the system and we

453
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,510
just neglected it and it kind of fizzled

454
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:31,520
out so that's very important researchers

455
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,410
and developers should work together and

456
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,450
in most of our cases researchers and

457
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,450
developers are kind of mixed category

458
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,700
because many people are one and the

459
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,210
other the only measure of success is

460
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,040
something that we can demonstrate so we

461
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,810
can't just play with things because we

462
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,910
can't afford that and look at this is

463
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,980
cool this is nice this is this and no

464
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,110
don't do anything so we need to be able

465
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,600
to push this forward all the time and of

466
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,420
course like i said it goes together with

467
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,180
simplicity which means like being lazy

468
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,350
maximize the work that you don't have to

469
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,730
do and then i also can't came across

470
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,100
this devops terms like what is this

471
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,700
devil sing and and there was somehow i

472
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,560
started reading about it and i came

473
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,170
across an oval an IT novel basically

474
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,070
it's almost like a fairy tale of a

475
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,800
variety manager IT operations manager

476
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:30,110
Bill who comes to this really badly

477
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,050
organized IT department when you have

478
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,150
developers not talking to guys who are

479
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,240
in the operations and somehow this magic

480
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,630
character called Eric appears right and

481
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,390
the eric is like mr. Miyagi from karate

482
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,940
kid and he kind of starts talking into

483
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,220
this also a cryptic language that the

484
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,710
bill has to find out what it's what it's

485
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,260
all about and basically eric told bill

486
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,760
about three ways of DevOps first way

487
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,190
think about the systems right so that's

488
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,080
very important not do not think about

489
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,360
any individual part of the system think

490
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,270
about system in kind of that the whole

491
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,760
because the system will be as good as

492
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,310
the kind of worse possible part of what

493
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,380
you have so try to find both connects

494
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:15,760
and

495
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,520
those the second this rule is amplified

496
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,870
feedback amplifier feedback essentially

497
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,460
means that every and every stage of

498
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,500
development you can deliver something

499
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,250
and then you get the feedback from every

500
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,130
next stage of the development process so

501
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:39,430
the testers essentially give feedback to

502
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,650
to the developers the users give but

503
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,730
that happens in in in frequent loops and

504
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,670
the third way is try to experiment all

505
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,410
the time being researchers that's not

506
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,400
very difficult for us so I like this

507
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,290
principle the most and this is where we

508
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:59,170
actually were the most successful in

509
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,150
experimentation rather than actually

510
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,310
having a great and big huge lab with all

511
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,400
data behind it so for you for people who

512
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,470
don't have a lab I think you know the

513
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,480
put the important points are you know

514
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,030
start simple with with easy wins so

515
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,730
don't dwell on develop being all this

516
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,800
collection system and stuff because by

517
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,660
not having hardware I realize that over

518
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,150
over five or six months that it's not

519
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,330
necessarily required but some of the

520
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,280
good other things is like if you can if

521
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,080
you start building think about starting

522
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,360
small but then and then building up and

523
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,820
being able to scale I actually

524
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,160
considered also like a fully cloud

525
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,020
deployment of the lab because we work

526
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,670
remotely and it would be kind of very

527
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,370
interesting and as a cloud development

528
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,530
principle is you need to expect failure

529
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,420
so you need to design for failure and

530
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,250
it's most likely that the systems will

531
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,760
fail sooner or later so think about that

532
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,350
harness the power of community so there

533
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,260
are like all sorts of exchanges there

534
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,480
are community projects there are free

535
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,900
tools that we can use as well as groups

536
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,510
that we can join one a good example is a

537
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,490
Yara signature group where there's like

538
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,700
12 and a half thousand community are our

539
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,580
signatures that you we can for example

540
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,460
employ or deploy internally so automate

541
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,900
everything if you can and that

542
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,910
everything is source code basically two

543
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:28,060
things one is configuration and the

544
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,560
other one is provision so

545
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,880
everything can be done through tools

546
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,600
such as Linux containers and docker or

547
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,790
vagrant or something like that it allows

548
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,770
you to kind of experiment and those

549
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,750
configuration files can always be kept

550
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,090
in the source code repository and you

551
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,830
can also practice kind of continuous

552
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:48,700
delivery as you as you develop so some

553
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,080
of the tools that we actually ended up

554
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,850
with right first one is virustotal

555
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,800
everybody use it it's a virus total

556
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,370
intelligence it allows you to find

557
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,800
samples it's it's a no it's not free

558
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,800
it's free when you have it but it's a

559
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,090
good kind of you don't have to develop

560
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,190
any additional systems it's allow you to

561
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,170
deploy your own yarra rules based on the

562
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,180
results of scanning you can get all the

563
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,340
new samples and it's really really

564
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,020
powerful especially if we have the kind

565
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,480
of highest level of requests and

566
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,330
privileges so once when you got that we

567
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,310
feel that locally actually Claudia

568
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,950
Guarnere was here and he developed both

569
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,750
of these the next two tools one of them

570
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,150
is Viper which we'll use for local

571
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,030
storing of the of the files and it also

572
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,980
allows you to do like really kind of

573
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:38,140
great static analysis and create little

574
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,720
projects that you can have kind of

575
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,400
groups of files with for particular

576
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,290
incidents and things like that it's

577
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,300
geared towards individual users but we

578
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,070
are trying to kind of extend it so

579
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,990
everybody can use it as like an in

580
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,410
server it has your it's only our rules

581
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,170
so those are like became de facto

582
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:58,240
standards in in the kind of non AV

583
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,820
community or modern researchers and and

584
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,800
heavily modified cuckoo you see there's

585
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,990
a HP logo i modified it so so we use

586
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,910
cuckoo sandbox as well for internal

587
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,040
internal development but by the equiv

588
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,570
and fork which basically has some

589
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,140
additional capabilities internal virtual

590
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,190
machine agent is hides the virtual

591
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,500
machine better and works on 64-bit as

592
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,600
well in 32-bit and it has some

593
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,870
plastering capabilities general you see

594
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,730
old all the results which is nice and

595
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,850
the clustering is based on mal here

596
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,250
project which based take static and

597
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,010
dynamic dynamic characteristics of the

598
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,350
file hashes themselves k to normalize

599
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,090
them in Phi the distance between the

600
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,010
too fast so you can actually see which

601
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,570
ones are pretty similar to the one that

602
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,430
you already submitted submitted to the

603
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:53,830
system so implementation phases i think

604
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,930
we more more or less cover that start

605
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:58,030
with small and then build to to actually

606
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,630
have be able to get to the cloud

607
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,250
implementation choices we like i said i

608
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,860
wanted to cloud but we ended up with two

609
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,590
wrecks on the right so it's kind of

610
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,620
exciting but I I thought we are going to

611
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,240
come with this kind of great

612
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,010
architecture where everything can be

613
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:18,660
horizontally scale like this will have

614
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,850
load balancers we could can have many

615
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,340
many many many users but that didn't

616
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,460
really materialize but it's something to

617
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,710
consider if you want to build a lab like

618
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:33,340
that so in summary it's pretty complex

619
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,530
thing to build a fully functional

620
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,990
malware lab but you know you can start

621
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,790
for something which is pretty small and

622
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,580
it will get you to to a certain point if

623
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,440
you process on the only relevant samples

624
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,260
like for example HP internally our IT

625
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,420
guys are doing anything between three

626
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,340
and five hundred samples a day so not a

627
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,560
lot but it's a three hundred thousand a

628
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,590
big company 300,000 people are employees

629
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:00,880
in HP so that's a kind of roughly the

630
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,040
size of our number of hours that these

631
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,020
little teams of my other researchers

632
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,060
inside fortune 100 companies are looking

633
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,570
to analyze a day start from small and

634
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,760
then I think you know think in terms of

635
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,500
these devil plays because it's kind of

636
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,300
an interesting approach to to

637
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,910
development so with that I think we are

638
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,620
done I don't think I'm not sure if I

639
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,720
have many more times but I would like to

640
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,550
thank you and then if you have any

641
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,670
questions please do well that was kind

642
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,050
of a blast from the past I haven't

643
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,270
really thought of the immune system for

644
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,610
a while it's been nearly 20 years are

645
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,770
there any questions about on the subject

646
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,050
we only have time for like one or two

647
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,980
see if we really quick

648
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,700
and suggestions I'm fishing for that

649
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:52,930
slow what to do or not to do I was

650
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,250
actually just going to ask a very very

651
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,810
stupid question I didn't quite catch the

652
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,460
name of the data storage that you said

653
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,710
you're using was really a Viper but

654
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,650
enough oh oh that was Viper yeah oh I

655
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,780
thought you had like a datastore system

656
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,020
or dentist or the other the HP slate for

657
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:13,030
each museum yeah it's a 33 par yeah it's

658
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,820
