1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,990
yeah so finally please welcome Eric you

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,450
from no minimum for inside fqdn searches

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:23,760
on the internet thank you can you hear

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,510
me good morning sorry for the delay and

5
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,930
recently we have observed some strange

6
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,210
internet traffic especially with a large

7
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,070
increase of unique 40 qualified at only

8
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,030
names and the suddenly increase of those

9
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,670
kind of larger volumes post-series

10
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,789
impact on the interlopers availability

11
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,899
as we as sterility so let's take a look

12
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,780
at some root causes behind the soldiers

13
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,150
before we are going to do that let's

14
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,960
revisit what's going on with ems and

15
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,780
then don't mean any service so can

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,360
anyone remember this IP address do you

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,799
know what does it stand for actually

18
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,259
this is our conference website so tennis

19
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,970
is very simple internet service provide

20
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,479
translation from pneumatic IP address

21
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,750
which is normally hard to remember to a

22
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:46,610
more user-friendly and domain name so

23
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:52,409
the dinners basically consists of number

24
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,549
of the records which basically translate

25
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:01,140
the dhamma names and IP address and this

26
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,770
is very basic function that required and

27
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,259
used by all the little among internet

28
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:13,050
apps but at the same time that the US

29
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,630
has been

30
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,590
used more frequently by bad guys in the

31
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,930
past we have seen that Venus has been

32
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,260
used as enable functions to build up

33
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,710
large skill pallets like things to

34
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:34,510
conduct a PG attack or DDoS attack as

35
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,160
well as Maori distribution of such a

36
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,660
visionary we have seen that deenus has

37
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,490
been used as direct attacking tools

38
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,300
things like Tina's amplification attack

39
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,490
basically you can create a large thing

40
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:56,560
as a response for short dns queries as

41
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,530
well as so-called a long term sub domain

42
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,590
attacks that can be used to take down yo

43
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,160
Gina's resolvers or the naming service

44
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,050
system for enterprise custom dns e is

45
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,860
also kind of serrated vector for latinas

46
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,330
colony basically you can turner or other

47
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:26,410
network protocols or data through the

48
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:35,080
port 53 so the data we have used for

49
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,270
this study is an ad image traffic with

50
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,930
other type of data as well for the

51
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,480
endless traffic basically we have about

52
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,850
three terabytes data connect everything

53
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:56,020
and the data is coming from all the

54
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:02,170
major x.x peace global winery and for

55
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,340
the privacy privacy concerns what we

56
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,790
have done is that we are normalize all

57
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:15,570
the source IP addresses of Venus Queens

58
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:20,470
basically what the IP address we collect

59
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,479
it will be all the faculty address but

60
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,290
the

61
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,320
RX piece they have a key to to a reverse

62
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,300
translation from the faculty adjust to

63
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,020
the rear IP address so the organization

64
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,470
of the source IP address give us a good

65
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,620
mechanism to preserve the privacy at the

66
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,500
same time we can have very useful data

67
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,440
so this three terabytes is corresponding

68
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,890
about three percent of the global dmoz

69
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,410
resolver traffic which give us pretty

70
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,250
good canal global view so we use this

71
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,130
data set to help us to identify a

72
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,950
malicious activities things like what we

73
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:18,460
did score and later on so here is the

74
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,210
measurement based on our data about the

75
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,230
number of the unique domain names on the

76
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,490
internet in the past 12 months and you

77
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,400
can see the blue line is a baseline

78
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,450
which is a normal damage traffic that

79
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,580
normally we all represent about three

80
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,970
hundred minion kind of unique domain

81
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,590
names we have seen on the internet but a

82
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:53,200
whale attack happens with all the kind

83
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,850
of either abuse of the day Athena's

84
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:03,130
protocol or other kind of activities we

85
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,450
see a lot of kind of high spark of the

86
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,050
unique thumbing names surround the ninja

87
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,810
of this color spark from a one minion

88
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:22,350
dominance up to 5.2 billion dominance so

89
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,830
this is kind of very difficult kind of

90
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,400
impacts

91
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,580
so let's take a look at some of the kind

92
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,780
of DNS based attacks that behind the

93
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,140
surging of the toning names volume on

94
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,260
the internet couple of things that we

95
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,890
have observed one is the amplification

96
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:54,080
attacks the non long subdomains northern

97
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,260
South America is quite interesting it

98
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,680
first occurred about three years ago

99
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,150
basically you can attach random strings

100
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,590
as kind of prefixed of a legitimate

101
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,430
dominance and game is tunneling of

102
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,060
course you can use either kind of text

103
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,930
field or subdomain name strings to

104
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,350
convert a useful information past you

105
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:29,210
file an interesting observation we have

106
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,430
seen that home gateways or homer orders

107
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,620
has been a part of this kind of attack

108
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,950
platform we have SI SE lo or good talks

109
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,980
here in the past two days talking about

110
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,360
the vulnerable home waters that are can

111
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,670
easily infected and upload it with

112
00:07:52,670 --> 00:08:02,180
attacking tools so here is the user case

113
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,220
we have kind of analyzed this is based

114
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,690
law on every Desai's Alex piece data

115
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,830
this is a one-day data you can see the

116
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,710
chart on the Left basically shows a

117
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,530
partition of so-called good Tina's

118
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,820
traffic whisper tienes traffic and that

119
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:31,430
day we saw about twelve percent of the

120
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,409
DNS queries are associated with

121
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:37,820
malicious activities the chart on the

122
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,120
right side is further grouping of the

123
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,849
malicious tina's traffic

124
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:47,060
and the majority of them actually were

125
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,730
involved with random subatomic attacks

126
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,319
that that's about eight percent another

127
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:55,940
fifteen percent was involved with

128
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,940
amplification attacks why the

129
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,480
traditional Adina's kind of traffic used

130
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,620
for ballot commander control that volume

131
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,000
is a small that was about five percent

132
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,139
but as we know that five percent

133
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:19,509
actually might have much kind of high

134
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:23,690
impact because of the nature of the

135
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,759
ballots cnc for the pilot traffic of

136
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:32,360
that five cent here is a further Dennis

137
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,279
query accounts a solution with different

138
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:41,000
palates kind of on types for that

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,889
particular custom on Saturday and the

140
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:48,880
majority of the kind of bad at C&C

141
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,240
activities were socialized information

142
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,240
staining activities they are also some

143
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,459
legitimate kind of Lake see ddos parts

144
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:07,630
like my tools and bullet or is there

145
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:12,680
since that custom also provides mobile

146
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,439
service we also see some kind of

147
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:19,040
smartphones parts activities like msn

148
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,480
sander so with the disco love analyze it

149
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,880
give us pretty good visibility of what's

150
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,709
going wrong and throws a tina's traffic

151
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:39,199
analyze so now let's look at the kind of

152
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:42,620
dingers and replication attacks how did

153
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,470
it go in the past we have seen that

154
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:49,519
those kind of amplification attacks may

155
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,089
really enabled by opening as a resolver

156
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:56,940
like I see that awk but these

157
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,520
we have see that the so-called

158
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,730
purpose-built amplifier startled crow so

159
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,370
this is an atoning named restore club

160
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:11,940
but are you this is the dawning name set

161
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,400
up exclusively for amplification attack

162
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:23,370
and this kind of amplifier can produce a

163
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,750
large amount of demons DDoS attack

164
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,200
streams here is the simple formula to

165
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,370
calculate the strength of the DDoS

166
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,680
traffic the borderline basically shows

167
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,740
that if we have four kilobytes kind of

168
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,690
exercise with nine min inquiries we can

169
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,130
produce 300 gigabytes can i tank strings

170
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,240
which is power which is enough to take

171
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,950
down any powerful web sites if the

172
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,820
exercise is up to 40 kilo bytes then we

173
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,850
can only need to have less than one

174
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:14,040
minute Kremers it's very simple to

175
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,280
construct this so-called purpose beaut

176
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:23,490
amplifier for this versatile cloth are

177
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,640
you basically the sky just use a set of

178
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:32,340
text strings and the exercise is close

179
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:39,240
to four cables there are other classical

180
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,790
method to construct amplifier here is

181
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,650
set of a records that can easily to

182
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:53,040
produce over 8k bites and since eyes so

183
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,860
it's pretty easy she do this gonna say

184
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,720
and it's rather well here is that

185
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,500
basically the sky just copy the

186
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,110
President Obama's not a neutrality

187
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,540
speech as

188
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,949
way to produce the amplifying so you can

189
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:20,459
see the answer size is over 3k both well

190
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:23,040
of the largest cannot amplify we have

191
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,899
see so far is the sky it produce the

192
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:35,940
answer size of 43 kilobytes so that's

193
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,980
the kind of amplification and attack for

194
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,230
the random subtly it take a different

195
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:47,600
approach the way they prove a

196
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,480
constructed is kind of queries is use on

197
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,380
random strings like the ones in the

198
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,420
right color and attached to the target

199
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,720
so called a codon which colored in a

200
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:12,720
young bro with this kind of random sub

201
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,420
donning a traffic which is very

202
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,110
different than our low modulus traffic

203
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,740
for the low modulus traffic we can have

204
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,579
so-called cash heat normally to every

205
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,819
eighty percent which is pretty high so

206
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:33,410
basically we'd only need to do recursion

207
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:38,819
for every single game escuela Y if what

208
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:41,670
is kind of random our sub Atomics

209
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:47,519
queries each one is unique so we have to

210
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,910
do recursing for each of those kind of

211
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:56,010
sub queries and which basically increase

212
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:01,170
the workload for the resolver if it is

213
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,139
eighty percent for the lomo traffic then

214
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:09,240
we have to pay 5x workload for the

215
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,069
random sampling credits which also means

216
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:18,000
that if we have say if we have a DNS

217
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,190
resolver designed to solve

218
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:27,370
to answer 100k queries per second for

219
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,970
this kind of random subdominant where's

220
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:34,030
the workload we are the 500,000 or cubes

221
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:38,170
yes yes that's a lot another thing is it

222
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:43,480
and we have seen many so-called large

223
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,170
powerful website states they provide a

224
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,840
very big data pipe to a pazul absorb and

225
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,470
normal DDoS attack traffic but here in

226
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,700
this case this color at can easily take

227
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,850
it down the lady cinema of that powerful

228
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,900
web site so there's a little way to take

229
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:14,590
a look on our website down here the

230
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:19,120
earth ones example how those kind of

231
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,480
random sub timing queries kind of is

232
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,330
composed this is a Chinese gaming site

233
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:32,860
des chant 28 calm so you can see they

234
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:38,640
can use a variance of randoms of strings

235
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:48,010
attached to that King this chantel 8.com

236
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:51,370
that caused that can easily take down

237
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:57,120
this kind of website we also see that

238
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,490
the this kind of technique has been

239
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:06,010
moved from us kind of gaming sites to a

240
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:12,329
more high ranking website this is attack

241
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:20,920
against a minecraft power silver it's

242
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,010
similar technique and the table on the

243
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,430
right side basically show within 24

244
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:31,470
hours the number of unique subtly names

245
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,120
for that

246
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:41,630
mindcraft silver the the total volume is

247
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:47,620
very big it cannot reach to 170 million

248
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:54,789
unique sub toning queries for that

249
00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:59,450
minecraft server and that's pretty easy

250
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,440
to take down on that seller and make

251
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:14,000
eight legged service unavailable more

252
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,250
reason early we have see that this

253
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,759
technique started being used to attack

254
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:28,460
some local sighs I for the privacy

255
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,120
concern and I did not show that local

256
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,139
sites can have four names but you can

257
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:40,639
see and the the way the controls that is

258
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:43,330
kind of random some tuning strings is

259
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,090
quite Kramer and is it just use time

260
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,340
step plot some randoms of strings and

261
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,620
for that custom actually that website

262
00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:07,360
was also take down quite easy the top

263
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,570
theories actually is not safe as well

264
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:18,799
last week this is a new type of strings

265
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:25,539
we have seen that went to tour com so

266
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:30,919
that post some kind of challenges in the

267
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:35,590
sense that on some solutions in the past

268
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,960
people have been used to deal with this

269
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,649
kind of naanum subtly armed attacks is

270
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:46,160
basically disabled all the car

271
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:53,570
of dingers queries to that target domain

272
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,950
name if it's kind of low profile only

273
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,290
name it's fine you can block all the

274
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:04,040
traffic because it will have no impact

275
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,120
to you but if it's highlighted and

276
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,160
turning them or the one like coyotes

277
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,530
it's very hard to just use a simple

278
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:18,050
blocking because that we are also

279
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,650
disable the key demand traffic so we

280
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,450
have to find a better way to deal with

281
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:28,610
this kind of attacks so let's take a

282
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,760
look at how this kind of traffic can be

283
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,630
generated you know what's the kind of

284
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,960
how many hikes please we need to launch

285
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:46,330
this gonna attack this is a one-day

286
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:51,530
attack traffic analyze you can see that

287
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:56,150
for single IP address and within one

288
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:00,440
hour that IP address can challenge over

289
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:06,580
9 million queries and it's it's pretty

290
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,700
powerful and if we look at this

291
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,290
histogram within 15 IP addresses we can

292
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:21,440
produce over 60 million queries so for

293
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,430
that one for that particular attack for

294
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:30,230
single XPS and it only need to have 200

295
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,110
IP addresses to generate 83 million

296
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:38,780
queries within one hour and this is

297
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,410
another way to look at on the number of

298
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:46,730
IPA and addresses involved with attack

299
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,960
per hour and a notice that most of those

300
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,990
IP addresses are associated with home

301
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:58,390
Reuters home devices

302
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:06,529
another thing we have observed with this

303
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:09,789
kind of thing as a tag is Dennis tunnel

304
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:13,759
so for this tunnel traffic is very

305
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:17,710
similar to on random subatomic attack

306
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,840
traffic but it's used for different

307
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,789
purpose you can see here is basically to

308
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:30,139
open your spot 53 to convert some kind

309
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:39,619
of informations behind the firewall we

310
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:44,240
have seen on some talks about vulnerable

311
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,200
home gateways and one thing is that we

312
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,470
have noticed that most of home again

313
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:56,149
ways either don't have puzzled or have a

314
00:22:56,149 --> 00:23:00,619
very weak kind of puzzled specially for

315
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:04,879
default here and many customs or

316
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:07,399
consumers they don't bother to change

317
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:10,610
the past password at all so if we go to

318
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,960
this website load a password huh if you

319
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,879
kind of put your orders and name it will

320
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:23,929
give you all the default puzzled as you

321
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:28,570
can see most of kind of homo ladders

322
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:36,619
they use admin or public or long as the

323
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:40,399
puzzled so it's very easy to get into

324
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:45,139
those home gateways here is already

325
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:49,249
example is not gear and basically

326
00:23:49,249 --> 00:23:53,230
Medicare is use one two three four as

327
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:57,320
the default we're just puzzled they

328
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,600
don't bother to use any kind of

329
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,499
sophisticated password at all so that's

330
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:06,679
very kind of post challenge of us

331
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:10,090
because those kind of home

332
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,630
home gateway device can be easily access

333
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,620
and can be easily infected and be part

334
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:25,929
of this kind of attack platform so what

335
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:32,919
can we do from genocide what we have

336
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:37,659
found in that it will be important to do

337
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:40,710
in traffic theatre at increased site

338
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:45,460
basically to look at what are the kind

339
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,980
of good traffic about traffic and

340
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,270
disable the bad traffic it's important

341
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,659
to have Leo town cannot analyze

342
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,539
capability because as we see is pretty

343
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:01,570
easy to generate different kind of

344
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:05,890
attractions and wide arresting is also

345
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,799
important especially for the long term

346
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:14,620
sub Tommy attacks because most of the

347
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,260
lava truck traffic mixed with the

348
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,159
determine our DNS queries so without a

349
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:24,760
good wider listing we will not be able

350
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:32,740
to have effective protection at all so

351
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:38,970
in summary and we have seen this kind of

352
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:44,080
huge increase of domain names on the

353
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,200
internet most of them come from that

354
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,620
so-called a dns based attacks and that

355
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:58,179
is very serious problem so besides what

356
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:04,600
we need to do is to make cleaners as

357
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,510
infrastructure more stable at the same

358
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:10,149
time we also need to address the weak

359
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:13,210
link in the security chain one of the

360
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,840
weakening clear is kind of home a

361
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,730
getaway device and that need to be

362
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:27,919
secured okay that's the end of my talk I

363
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,830
do I have some time for the QA I think

364
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:38,970
we have time for one to two questions so

365
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,559
are there any questions from our

366
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,678
audience

367
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,960
so well what do you think a whole can be

368
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,690
routed dilemma be resolved with all the

369
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:03,400
default passwords yeah this is I guess

370
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,730
suddenly education of the conoco summary

371
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:11,220
is important so that people can realize

372
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,130
if we don't bother to change the default

373
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:18,190
passport puzzled not only across the

374
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,650
serious problem another thing is it to

375
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:23,350
work with a vendor to ensure that they

376
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,320
provide a better kind of protection for

377
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,380
example to provide the requirement that

378
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,990
you have Ching changing your password

379
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:40,630
when you first install your order yeah

380
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,940
rotors can definitely be a very powerful

381
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:49,060
bot army right yes sure if you have no

382
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:54,780
questions and let's say thank you
