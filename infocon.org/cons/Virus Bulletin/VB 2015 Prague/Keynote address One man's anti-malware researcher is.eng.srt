a lot of you have been looking forward

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,420
to this moment all week and maybe longer

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,029
and to get you warmed up for our

6
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:22,830
traditional closing ceremony we have a

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,990
closing keynote which will be delivered

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,130
by the great costume range

9
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:36,149
thank you thank you I want to say or

10
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,890
like big thanks to the virus bulletin

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,170
team who invited me to give this keynote

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,129
here

13
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,640
I remember seeing Jimmy ku a couple of

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,850
years ago like I'm please raise your

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,120
hands if you know Jimmy all right a pity

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,039
that Jimmy is not here this year we all

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,050
miss him and I remember he did a keynote

18
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,760
that virus bulletin and during the

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,640
keynote he said this is the peak moment

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,289
of my career because it's like the

21
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,229
greatest honor that I could ever get to

22
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:06,060
deliver a keynote at virus bulletin and

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,880
I feel honored to be here doing this

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,220
today for the virus bulletin he meant

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,729
for you so to be honest I haven't been

26
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,960
adverse bulletin since about five years

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,390
ago so about five years ago in a country

28
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,790
far far away how many people remember

29
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,390
where virus bulletin was five years ago

30
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,020
where was it anyone Vancouver Canada

31
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,530
Vancouver kina the beautiful photos of

32
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,950
pawel bodies some of them the opening

33
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,840
ceremony maybe some of you remember

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,770
perhaps some of the live demos from VB

35
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,070
2010 I think that there was a moment

36
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,689
when we learned that Stuxnet

37
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:57,840
besides blowing up centrifuges can also

38
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,579
blow up balloons with Liam emerging from

39
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,219
Symantec which was a memorable

40
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,750
presentation a few other people mick

41
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,090
OHIP bunun who is in the audience here

42
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,390
with us today liked it with his 50

43
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,660
copies

44
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,420
all right and a few other people some

45
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,690
are here some were not what was the

46
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,090
let's say the central point for me at

47
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,400
least in 2010 I was invited to speak

48
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,890
about Stuxnet and this happened because

49
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,530
of an accident because Alex Gustav who

50
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,050
was originally scheduled to speak about

51
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,150
stocks that he couldn't get a visa for

52
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,280
Canada so he asked me do you have a visa

53
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,920
for Canada I said yes why I want you to

54
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,320
go at virus bulletins and he was my boss

55
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,200
back then and to speak about starters

56
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,880
and me why are you doing this to me what

57
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,620
I went there and I had this presentation

58
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,100
about stocks and I remember was the

59
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,990
moment I walked up the stage there were

60
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,690
three guys in the back and those three

61
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,209
guys showed up from a virus bulletin

62
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:05,610
like the moment they of the first day

63
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,310
and they paid in cash for the

64
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,970
registration and when Helen asked them

65
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,440
where are you guys from we think they

66
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,190
said mysteriously GOI and it's up to you

67
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,739
how to interpret what GOI means I

68
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,570
remember these three guys were sitting

69
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,150
at the back at the room and they were

70
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,140
definitely not happy with my

71
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,480
presentation about Stuxnet for some

72
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,459
reason so it was like quite intimidating

73
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,920
to see them back there looking like in a

74
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,160
very aggressive way of me so I said like

75
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,350
you know guys I'm a bit uncomfortable to

76
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,269
be honest to be here today and speak

77
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:41,190
about this huge thing called Stuxnet

78
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,100
because of the huge implications you

79
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,739
know behind it at first no cyber weapon

80
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,489
and all that and the reality is that

81
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:51,930
nothing happened during the conference

82
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,480
so everything was fine I went back home

83
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,280
and that I think was November 28th when

84
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,830
I got back home in the evening so I

85
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,140
opened the doors with my wife and we go

86
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,769
to the main our main living room and on

87
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:10,500
the main living room on the table there

88
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,920
is a gift which was this little cube

89
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,250
white cube which Young has a message

90
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,918
saying take a break and perhaps

91
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,380
coincidentally go incidentally on the

92
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,870
same day there were news in the media

93
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,690
about the

94
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,260
fact that three of Iran's top tax lien

95
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,050
researchers were assassinated in Teheran

96
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,020
so I asked my wife why did you put the

97
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,850
rubber cube on the table and she says I

98
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,220
didn't put it because I was at work all

99
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,900
day and said I didn't put it either so

100
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,180
who put the cube on the table so you can

101
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,890
imagine is like a pretty scary situation

102
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,140
you go into your home and you find the

103
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,710
gift like this on the table and you try

104
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,770
to understand okay so someone broke into

105
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,110
my home and put this on the table like

106
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,450
just if you guys can see it a bit better

107
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,170
it was quite scary and to be honest I

108
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,370
understood the message I said okay I'm

109
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,650
gonna take a break I got that the three

110
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,300
evil guys in the back

111
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,700
managed to convey their message so I did

112
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,610
take a break for a while for a while so

113
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,100
this is how it looks like if you're

114
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,630
wondering what we have been during the

115
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,980
last five years

116
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,000
as you can see 2010 Stuxnet and there's

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,830
like not much activity in 2011 Baldy who

118
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,580
is here in the audience discover Stuxnet

119
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,660
can we have a round of applause for

120
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:45,820
Baldy thank you so body discovered the

121
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,100
do kill and I was still taking a break I

122
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,260
tell you you know the message was very

123
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,290
strong so I didn't get too involved but

124
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,169
then you know we do q it was like really

125
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:58,140
so interesting that you couldn't like

126
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,150
hold your curiosity I mean is like a

127
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,640
very powerful struggle going on should I

128
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,370
like still take a break or should I dive

129
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,230
into the stock and this is the like new

130
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,570
Stuxnet thing in the Dukey and you know

131
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,180
eventually the oldest arguments in my

132
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,010
head you know I came to the conclusion

133
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,930
of a fit

134
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,870
I'm gonna look at do Q so we started

135
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,960
looking at do Q and then after a while

136
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,970
we started looking at other things and

137
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,980
we discovered flame and then we

138
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,480
discovered the Gauss and then we

139
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,850
discovered mini flame and we discovered

140
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,770
a few others which are not on the slides

141
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,660
here but then we discovered mini do

142
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,229
producto bur

143
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,240
and so on and so on and what you can see

144
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,599
actually from this graphic from this map

145
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:44,629
of our announcement and discoveries at

146
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:46,819
the end the amount of announcements has

147
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:48,919
been growing steadily so we've been

148
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,259
publishing more and more stuff obviously

149
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:56,749
making more and more people unhappy so I

150
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,819
think this is a kind of a trend in the

151
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:02,300
industry that since 2009 the number of

152
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,639
apt campaigns exposures has increased

153
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,150
considerably and to be honest different

154
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,439
companies focus on different things for

155
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,089
instance there are companies out there

156
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:17,749
let's say certain companies will only

157
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:20,270
write about Chinese threats so they will

158
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,430
never write about anything else except

159
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,379
Chinese threats and I think that

160
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:27,770
focusing on one thing makes you blind

161
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,659
to the whole picture and it actually

162
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:31,490
with a moment you do that you create a

163
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,419
distorted view of the real world and

164
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:37,189
actually this is a safe path because I

165
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:39,939
haven't heard of anyone who was harassed

166
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:42,969
after presenting about Chinese threats

167
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:45,409
so I'm not saying it's not possible and

168
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:46,849
just say you know I haven't heard about

169
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:50,479
it so I'll give you an example this is

170
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,810
the cyber their adversaries statistics

171
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,000
from CrowdStrike

172
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,430
and it's from 2013 so if you look at

173
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,979
their graphics they say like the world

174
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:04,250
situation right now as it is we have 41

175
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,740
active threat actors that we are

176
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,789
tracking and of those 31 of them are

177
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:14,149
pandas which is basically China we have

178
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:16,759
four jackals which as far as I remember

179
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,529
crime where we have two spiders which is

180
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:23,599
anonymous or is the other way around and

181
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,580
then we have one kitten one Iranian

182
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,879
actor one Tiger one Indian actor and one

183
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,430
Russian actor one beer in one bath I

184
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,880
don't remember what the bat is but maybe

185
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,370
some of you do so if you look at the map

186
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,639
you it's very easy to think that this is

187
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:42,620
everything that is out there like the

188
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,709
large majority of that is Chinese

189
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:48,610
threats some anonymous some hacktivists

190
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,180
one Iranian

191
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,480
guy one Russian guy and some let's say

192
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,710
another Indian guy but now this is

193
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,290
something that we didn't want to do at

194
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,420
Kaspersky so we actually decided to

195
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,860
choose the unsafe path and we say like

196
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,810
okay we're going to analyze everything

197
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,420
that comes our way

198
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,010
it doesn't matter where it comes from

199
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,560
we'll just take the unsafe way so this

200
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,110
includes on one hand I say things I just

201
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,980
do to Stuxnet flame whatever but also

202
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,529
let's say Russian speaking a PT's such

203
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:26,779
as Red October black energy minute of

204
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:29,690
team Spy cosmic nuke and so on and so on

205
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,399
and this is what we have done and

206
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,660
actually I very strongly believe that we

207
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,750
have published about more Russian

208
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,990
targeted attacks than any other a

209
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,730
security company out there and if

210
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,410
there's one of you who don't believe it

211
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,270
you just check it out and I think that

212
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,670
we have published more about Russian

213
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,310
groups at any other company with us

214
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,459
being a Russian company of course but at

215
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:57,260
the same time we wanted to give you like

216
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,209
a balanced view of the world so we

217
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:01,209
published about careto

218
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:05,150
which means kind of ugly face in the

219
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,920
Spanish we published about flaming Gauss

220
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,959
Homer you probably know where they like

221
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:15,620
supposedly coming from Reagan and most

222
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,500
recently about the equation so well of

223
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,600
course that all this research that we

224
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,330
have done has brought a bit of unwanted

225
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,560
attention to our company and there is

226
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,810
actually quite good proof of that here's

227
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:36,279
a top-secret document leaked by Snowden

228
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:40,190
from the NSA and they're talking about

229
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,600
our security products and they're saying

230
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,000
their counterpart in the UK GCHQ they're

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,790
saying personal security products which

232
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,640
is their word for antivirus such as

233
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,770
Kaspersky continued to pose a challenge

234
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,160
to GCHQ capability which makes me very

235
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,440
proud because it means that we are

236
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,660
probably doing a very good

237
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,020
job and if we like a small company with

238
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,840
3,000 employees can stop the malware

239
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,190
produced by 30,000 strong Intelligence

240
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,080
Agency with billions of dollars of

241
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,840
budget it means that we are probably

242
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,110
doing something right well however we

243
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,670
were not the only company that was

244
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,190
targeted by this agency so here's a few

245
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,780
other examples we have anywhere from

246
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,470
let's say BitDefender in the audience we

247
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,110
have here my colleagues from Romania

248
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,600
we are very own from FSB antivirus

249
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,410
whatever that is that's a like a funny

250
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,560
product from France I don't remember

251
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,570
seeing FSB antivirus but this was

252
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,590
definitely interesting for GCHQ anyone

253
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,430
from AVG we can go around hands

254
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,130
all right have fraud I know this one

255
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,580
when a fraud here even if Miko's not all

256
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,420
right from ephra so to be honest there

257
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,280
is something wrong with this picture can

258
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,600
you see what is wrong with the picture

259
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:13,530
yes what's wrong what

260
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,230
it is not an anti-virus it's a sick

261
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,839
personal security antivirus is that

262
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:19,470
right

263
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,830
I think he's complaining that antivirus

264
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,740
is that well what is wrong in my opinion

265
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,170
right who said that he said there's no

266
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,540
American companies on the slide so you

267
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,940
won't see here are McAfee on fees we

268
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,670
won't see here Symantec which is

269
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,529
interesting it means that only some

270
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:42,779
antivirus companies have this kind of

271
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:45,060
troubles other companies do not have

272
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,100
this kind of troubles so let's say

273
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,970
whatever the less we do we did well we

274
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,399
have and we did have this kind of

275
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,230
problems and I can tell you one of the

276
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,649
hardest moments in my life was I think

277
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:00,870
it was a few days before my birthday

278
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:06,240
actually this year one of my colleagues

279
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,850
sent me a message that we have an

280
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,270
infection in our company site and this

281
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,000
was like at midnight it was something

282
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,370
like midnight said we have an infection

283
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,550
in our company come on what happened

284
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,250
this time one of the secretaries got

285
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,740
infected with cryptolocker because she

286
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,680
used her personal laptop and said like

287
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,170
whatever I ignored him so I woke up the

288
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,860
next morning at 7:00 and I loved in like

289
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,140
in our private jabber server and lo and

290
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,040
behold this guy was online and this guy

291
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,740
usually he goes to work at 12:00 or 1:00

292
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,650
and this time he was online at 7:00 a.m.

293
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,170
so I said dude was wrong are you sick

294
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,990
where are you online at 7:00 a.m. like

295
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,450
it's so unusual for you he said that we

296
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,160
have infection in our network it's

297
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,260
something so advanced that we couldn't

298
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,620
find the sample yet and there's like no

299
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,779
samples anywhere but more is in memory

300
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,970
and it jumps from one computer to

301
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,000
another and it's absolutely crazy

302
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,550
because we don't know how it replicates

303
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,200
and it seems to be something really

304
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,089
really advanced we haven't seen anything

305
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:17,700
like that before so I said corn what

306
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,730
have you been drinking man we haven't

307
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,860
seen anything like that before so then

308
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,660
we started looking and looking and it

309
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,790
was like an ops

310
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,910
incredible story and we couldn't believe

311
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,600
our eyes that someone was actually bold

312
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,330
enough to target an anti-virus company

313
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,950
with the virus well with the warm

314
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,230
because basically was spreading in our

315
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,100
network is a warm and they had at least

316
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,250
I think one zero day but we believe they

317
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,100
had at least three zero days they used

318
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,830
during the infection there was pretty

319
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,340
pretty scary but nevertheless we started

320
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,920
reversing we captured a malware and we

321
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,660
found it was actually an updated version

322
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,480
of Dooku and you know everything came

323
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,910
together because we did write a lot

324
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,190
about do Q on our page we wrote about

325
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,580
ten stories about Dooku and 2011 so

326
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,920
obviously the people behind Luke you

327
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,990
didn't take that lightly and decided to

328
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,970
retaliate against our company so what is

329
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,100
even more scary is that they left some

330
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,380
clues in the code kind of suggesting

331
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,140
that you know we're watching you to

332
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,510
myself personally and there is one of

333
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,540
the drivers which they use for tunneling

334
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,460
into our natter had the predefined

335
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,220
string Romanian anti hacker inside and

336
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,010
the moment that a packet with this

337
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,720
string came it would actually translate

338
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,300
it into our network so that was I would

339
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,150
say pretty pretty wicked and it got me

340
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,120
thinking again about the fact that maybe

341
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,520
I should take a break again or not so

342
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,390
what I'm gonna do today I want to

343
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,870
actually to judge the arguments and I

344
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,360
believe there is a kind of a war going

345
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,160
between intelligence agencies and

346
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,620
security companies and some security

347
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,020
companies and maybe even if you don't

348
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,030
know it now maybe you will know it

349
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,270
someday but I believe that in this fight

350
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:21,230
there is a quite imbalance there is a

351
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,990
quite a big imbalance about what we can

352
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,950
do and what they can do so I will invite

353
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:32,690
one of my colleagues who will actually

354
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,160
play the role of the spook and

355
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:43,990
please welcome mr. J the spook what we

356
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,990
are gonna do we are gonna both of us

357
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,630
will give you arguments about what we

358
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,610
are doing and how we are doing it and if

359
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,649
you are doing it well and at the end

360
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:56,259
I'll like you all to vote who is

361
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:58,589
actually winning the war between

362
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:01,269
antivirus companies and the spooks so

363
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:03,610
let's see who will be like the better

364
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,040
man thank you very much Thank You Austin

365
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,299
all right so can you go ahead and make

366
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:12,400
your introduction well do I really need

367
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,079
to make my introduction I mean everybody

368
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,240
here is enjoying quite a bit of job

369
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,419
security thanks to our work so it is my

370
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:21,339
pleasure to be here but I certainly

371
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,319
think that they all know the kinds of

372
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,270
things that we are doing I don't need to

373
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,730
say it you know we're the best

374
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,440
you know we're absolutely the best we

375
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,940
give you guys some of the best malware

376
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,950
to work with but not only that you know

377
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,200
you get some nice exploit Samoa days

378
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,270
we've got fiber taps we employ the best

379
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,580
programmers in the world you know we've

380
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,470
got math and magicians as I like to call

381
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,120
them we've got cryptographers everywhere

382
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,500
so if you got a pesky little

383
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,240
cryptographic paradigm I'm sure that we

384
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,570
can just blast through that eventually

385
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,740
our budgets are unlimited which I'm sure

386
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,130
has become you become aware of recently

387
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,929
as we keep leveraging all this money and

388
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:00,130
I think that there's something a little

389
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,990
more important there which is that we're

390
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,330
willing to do really whatever we need to

391
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,000
do to hit our targets and to make our

392
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,970
mark so at the end of the day we're just

393
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,700
doing our jobs Koston there it's illegal

394
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,190
of course it's legal it's illegal we're

395
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,290
government employees of course we all

396
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,650
right so like I can tell you that our

397
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,870
budget is limited so I don't know how

398
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,030
many of you guys manage budgets but my

399
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,220
budget has been getting smaller and

400
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,620
smaller every year like Costin we need

401
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,559
to save money okay what can I cut like

402
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,559
and I can tell it good researcher are

403
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:38,020
goddamn hard to find it's becoming

404
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,210
harder and harder I know what's going on

405
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,490
with the new generation of people but

406
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,530
it's becoming so hard to find good

407
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,299
people who can use iodine reverse

408
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:47,389
engineer or

409
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:50,809
I don't know however I do think that we

410
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:53,359
are having some kind of a success with

411
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,899
our cloud technologies and I think that

412
00:18:56,899 --> 00:18:59,509
opened a bunch of new doors to catch the

413
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:02,269
stuff that these guys are writing and we

414
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:04,039
understand that we know very little this

415
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,779
is I think one of the most important

416
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,639
things we realize there's a lot of stuff

417
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:09,799
out there that we don't detect and we

418
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:11,989
have a very simple goal which is we just

419
00:19:11,989 --> 00:19:14,779
want to protect the people who paid us

420
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:18,440
money to do so it seems like a nice goal

421
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,700
I suppose so why don't we put this

422
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,489
side-by-side let's go piece by piece so

423
00:19:25,489 --> 00:19:28,039
I mentioned the old days we do have an

424
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,959
unlimited supply of Oh days and I know

425
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:31,909
that that's the biggest headache out

426
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:35,329
there some of them products close to

427
00:19:35,329 --> 00:19:38,119
home but also you know Microsoft Adobe

428
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,799
Oracle whatever you guys are using we

429
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,749
can exploit that if not we can always

430
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:43,700
you know launch for the kernel we like

431
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,829
residing there getting to do whatever we

432
00:19:45,829 --> 00:19:48,379
want there and at the end of the day we

433
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:52,249
just need to be successful one time fair

434
00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:52,789
enough

435
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:55,279
well to be honest finding your zero days

436
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,190
is our favorite activity and we know

437
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,889
just actively hunt for them I mean I'm

438
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:03,320
paying bonuses to my guys whenever they

439
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,659
find one of your zero days so the more

440
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:07,639
zero days you use you know the more

441
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,979
happy we are because we'll find them and

442
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:12,499
that's more likely to catch you because

443
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:16,070
we know that the tractor that uses zero

444
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,869
day you know is that a kind of a

445
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:20,749
different level than the volatile cedar

446
00:20:20,749 --> 00:20:25,070
has Gulla encryption style people so to

447
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,469
be honest that's true that you have to

448
00:20:27,469 --> 00:20:30,109
be successful once and we have to be

449
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:32,209
successful every time in protecting our

450
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:34,609
users so I do realize that we have a

451
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,409
huge challenge here it sounds like I

452
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:37,879
need to start paying your guys some

453
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:42,139
bonuses too so as far as crypto goes you

454
00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:44,089
know it's it's not much of a challenge

455
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:45,919
when we're the ones creating most of the

456
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,679
crypto algorithms anyways and suggesting

457
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:50,359
them and letting companies know and this

458
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,950
know and everybody else know what they

459
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,769
should be using at the end of the day of

460
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:56,509
you guys enjoy certificates that seems

461
00:20:56,509 --> 00:20:58,000
to be something that you

462
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,500
wanted to pin your hopes on we've got

463
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,060
certificates too under a lot of

464
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,200
different names some of them even

465
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,320
Microsoft are quite nice and if we can't

466
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,560
just you know break the crypto we can

467
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,360
always sabotage it you can add a nice

468
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,460
little backdoor you know I like crypto

469
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,800
as much as anybody else likes crypto we

470
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,940
just think we should have the best

471
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,610
crypto I'm not you guys alright

472
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,850
oh the reality is I think whenever you

473
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,970
guys sign your malware is Microsoft and

474
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,400
that happened with flame you subvert

475
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,390
some major trust principles and with

476
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,950
four years we've thought our users to

477
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,680
use Windows updates so this will I think

478
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,110
eventually backfire at some point and

479
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,730
you want to do meaning the middle

480
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,980
attacks against windows up there I think

481
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,800
that's very very bad and the reality is

482
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,130
that you know all the elite crypto that

483
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,080
you're using it actually gives away your

484
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,970
mauler see if you're onner like free

485
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,060
advice from my side if you want to make

486
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,010
stay under the radar you just use soar

487
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:06,100
or base 64 like the Hezbollah okay fair

488
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,810
point I suppose we can start hiding

489
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:10,690
under the radar a little bit of maybe

490
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,970
some Chinese malware but while we're

491
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,890
speaking of malware there's a reason

492
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,420
that we don't want to just appropriate

493
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,130
some of his old stuff everybody else is

494
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,770
using these open-source rats in this

495
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,950
mediocre malware our malware is the best

496
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,960
I mean this stuff there's a reason why

497
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,550
you guys find it so entertaining and

498
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,230
everybody's making a living off of it I

499
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,540
mean our stuff is amazing you know so

500
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,340
not only is the platform amazing we've

501
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,380
got root kits to hide it we target some

502
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,330
of your security products directly so

503
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,240
you know we can adapt specifically to

504
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,860
your product or to anybody else's

505
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,520
product in the room and we enjoying

506
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,190
hiding as we do find the most creative

507
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,350
ways of doing this so you want to go in

508
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,990
the registry or virtual file systems or

509
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,090
raw disks or I don't know have you

510
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,320
checked the firmware on your hard drive

511
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,230
recently no have you guys checked it

512
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,150
well you the good news like the bad news

513
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,620
is that you cannot check it because

514
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,420
there's no API to read the

515
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,330
from your hard drives but anyways the

516
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,160
more you hide I think the more likely or

517
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,550
you will trigger an alarm and we haven't

518
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,520
i rootkit technologies we have

519
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,810
technologies that will detect virtual

520
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:23,340
file systems we have even like raw disk

521
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,020
access and scanning modules and to be

522
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,360
honest we were really surprised when we

523
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,110
found that firmer module with a QA ssin

524
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,780
that was like perhaps one of the biggest

525
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,150
surprises we do we always knew it was

526
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,820
possible but we didn't imagine it's like

527
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,770
a different thing when you like hold it

528
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,630
in your hands and say like oh my god it

529
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,360
actually this is something possible and

530
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,919
we're still working on that by the way

531
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,380
well you can work on the malware all you

532
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,100
want you can get all the O'Day's but you

533
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,300
know you've got to broaden your view

534
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,940
sometimes in our line of business you

535
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,740
have access to a lot more things so you

536
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,210
know if we can't hit you directly we

537
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,490
will hack the ISP if the ISP is not good

538
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,830
enough we go for the whole country we've

539
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,320
got a nice fleet of satellites we can

540
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,120
just kind of park behind yours if we

541
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,450
need to and I hate to say it coasting at

542
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,830
the end of the day you don't take the

543
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,900
right kind of breaks everyone's just

544
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:28,030
mortal yeah can we just give up all

545
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:31,000
right I mean let's not forget ago I mean

546
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,400
did you do something to the Wi-Fi here

547
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:38,170
by the way I think it's possible so to

548
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,790
be honest it's very easy and I've seen

549
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,920
this is a trap you know we can't hack

550
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,710
this guy so let's just hack his ISP you

551
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,960
know we cannot break into this is P

552
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,970
there's just intercept the entire

553
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,430
country and I believe that's you know

554
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:54,190
that don't forget what is a goal so if

555
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,170
you're actually going for the bad guys

556
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,780
you don't have to hack my ISP you don't

557
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,780
have to hack the Wi-Fi adverse bulletin

558
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,640
do not forget what is the goal and I

559
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,410
think it's very important not to subvert

560
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,110
the trust that people have put already

561
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:14,200
in to update mechanisms I mean I guess

562
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,060
we could do that but what we enjoy about

563
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,770
the kind of investments that we're doing

564
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,149
is

565
00:25:21,149 --> 00:25:23,999
they're multi-use custom I mean we go we

566
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:25,859
invest into an amazing platform and

567
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:29,070
until you guys burn it selfishly we can

568
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,749
infect anybody whether we go after

569
00:25:30,749 --> 00:25:33,149
Belgic um or Kiska tear or Merkel's aid

570
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:34,919
and terrorists I mean everybody wants to

571
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:36,059
go after terrorists so we go after

572
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,969
terrorists we make these amazing modular

573
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:40,259
platforms we can just kind of keep

574
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:41,789
rebuilding and you'd be surprised I mean

575
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:42,960
you go in there it's just point and

576
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,809
click it's super nice and then you've

577
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,009
you know you make this thing once you

578
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:48,450
invest once and you use it as many times

579
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,710
as you want what's wrong with that well

580
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,179
to be honest when you do that you know

581
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:55,979
the moment I find one of your things

582
00:25:55,979 --> 00:25:59,009
I'll find all of them and we proved that

583
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:01,139
with equation I mean we are originally

584
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:03,719
from one module and by simply looking

585
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:05,849
for samples using the same crypto

586
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:08,940
algorithms we found everything else so I

587
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,859
think it just makes it easier to find

588
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:13,379
everything and I think the worst thing

589
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:15,179
here is that you don't give me any

590
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,519
options and a lot of people have come to

591
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:19,369
me and complain I said like Nyssa oh

592
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,169
yeah we are on the offensive side but we

593
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:24,029
are the good guys here you understand

594
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:26,339
that we are that well you are the good

595
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:31,469
guy you see so I like if you are

596
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:34,019
actually you know protecting bad people

597
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:36,629
like terrorists by just catching our

598
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:39,419
mower with your antivirus Pula and to be

599
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:41,309
honest I think you know just give you

600
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:44,009
another friendly advice as long as you

601
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:45,839
use the same malware or John Jacques

602
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,629
Cartier or Merkel's aid and terrorists

603
00:26:48,629 --> 00:26:50,279
you give me no option because the moment

604
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:53,369
I find it on Merkel's eighth computer I

605
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:55,469
will find it pretty much everywhere and

606
00:26:55,469 --> 00:26:57,989
I'll kick you out of all these terrorist

607
00:26:57,989 --> 00:26:59,909
computers that you love so much just

608
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:04,799
protecting terrorists I don't know I

609
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,749
don't I don't think that you're really

610
00:27:06,749 --> 00:27:09,200
seeing the picture here coasting I mean

611
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,659
you have access to everything I mean

612
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:14,249
when you get into these systems it's

613
00:27:14,249 --> 00:27:16,469
it's like Christmas for us actually it's

614
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,239
getting a little overwhelming but it's

615
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:19,919
quite nice it's very exciting so you

616
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,419
know you get to collect everything we

617
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,219
get to extract metadata we I mean we

618
00:27:23,219 --> 00:27:24,719
generate information from the

619
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:26,399
information that you have on your system

620
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,289
and you know obviously we get the

621
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:29,969
screenshots and what everybody else gets

622
00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:31,440
and we can even just take all the

623
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,749
internet traffic if we need to rebuild

624
00:27:33,749 --> 00:27:34,799
some of the stuff arts

625
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,960
we don't really need it and we're having

626
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,840
trouble storing all of it but yeah it's

627
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,860
fun all right

628
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:47,370
no to be honest I wish I had access to

629
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,470
the systems that you have in order to

630
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,980
catch more bad guys or goodbyes but the

631
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,379
reality is a more active your malware is

632
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:57,529
the higher chances to catch it we have

633
00:27:57,529 --> 00:27:59,909
and we have you know all sorts of

634
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:02,730
technologies that will catch

635
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,370
Broad's processes and programs that do

636
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,440
suspicious things in your system I think

637
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,600
that exfiltration has always been a weak

638
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,610
point for mauler because the more you

639
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,590
collect and the more traffic you do to

640
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,110
like weird IP addresses the higher the

641
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,590
chances are that we will catch you and

642
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,230
you know one thing and there's a famous

643
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:25,799
saying in the Mossad which is a curse so

644
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,269
when the Mossad people they want to

645
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:29,700
curse each other they say may we read

646
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,970
about you in the newspapers as I can

647
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,009
tell you the same maybe we'll read the

648
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:37,019
body in the newspapers because the media

649
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:39,450
loves the numbers so the moment I can

650
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,440
say that the one apt group stole

651
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,549
information equaling 1000 times the size

652
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:49,799
of the Library of Congress pretty much

653
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,659
every journalist will write about that

654
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:54,480
and I think that you are not going to

655
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,249
like it I mean oh it's not the first

656
00:28:56,249 --> 00:29:00,450
time you've done that all right

657
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,820
at least our malware you can say it's

658
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,679
quite interesting you know we like the

659
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,330
quality stuff we want to make sure that

660
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,450
our money is genuinely going to good use

661
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,179
we make no mistakes our code is you know

662
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,509
the best most of the time we use only

663
00:29:15,509 --> 00:29:17,129
the best crypto as you mentioned we use

664
00:29:17,129 --> 00:29:19,230
compression but you know we've also got

665
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,700
our kernel mode orchestrators I mean

666
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,249
who's gonna you know just stick to one

667
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:24,690
executable and have everything done

668
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,100
there when you can have these nice

669
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,779
little components spread all around the

670
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:30,629
system doing whatever you need to do and

671
00:29:30,629 --> 00:29:32,549
you know we're never crashes so I really

672
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:34,139
don't see how you can complain about

673
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,809
what we're doing on these systems okay

674
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:40,559
well you know I think most of the people

675
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,840
here in the audience we are doing this

676
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,240
business because we like looking at

677
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,690
complex stuff and we like to reverse and

678
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,990
your stuff and taking it apart so I've

679
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:55,669
seen a very interesting discussion with

680
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:59,240
one guy who used to work in your area by

681
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,730
the way and here someone asked him like

682
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,539
how do you select the people to hire for

683
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:07,309
your reverse engineering teams and he

684
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:11,210
said I'm gonna hire anyone who took

685
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,990
apart his little toy or robot when he

686
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,279
was 6 years old

687
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:18,799
so if the if you're one of those guys or

688
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,080
whenever you were getting a present from

689
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,330
your family and the first thing was just

690
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,009
to take it apart and the family would

691
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:27,379
get upset like you know you ruin the new

692
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:29,389
robot then probably are one of those

693
00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:32,029
guys who are now working in a reverse

694
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:33,830
engineering and to be honest nobody

695
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,740
loves reverse engineering plug ax

696
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,279
samples five days a week which is I mean

697
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:42,500
come on it's how boring can that be we

698
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,659
want to reverse the best malware out

699
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:47,509
there and we like to find mistakes I

700
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:51,470
mean we completely I think destroyed the

701
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,440
Duke you guys when we published about

702
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,169
the mistakes they were making and of

703
00:30:57,169 --> 00:31:00,200
course when you crash you raise alarms

704
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,179
and I believe that from that point of

705
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:05,809
view can maybe do a better job of QA the

706
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:07,250
Duke you guys are still upset about that

707
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:11,659
by the way all right so just some

708
00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:13,879
takeaways from our discussion for you

709
00:31:13,879 --> 00:31:17,740
guys I believe that sophistication

710
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:22,220
attracts attention and as well as hiding

711
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,960
attracts attention so the more

712
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,610
sophisticated your mother is a more

713
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,129
stealthiness the more likely that will

714
00:31:28,129 --> 00:31:30,259
find it and whenever you in fact

715
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:32,450
Merkle's a door when you face your

716
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,190
junkies got there that will attract the

717
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,919
tensions and zero-days will attract

718
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:39,710
attention and crashes will attract

719
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,960
attention and the worst of all mass

720
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,259
infections and mass surveillance

721
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:46,220
technologies will always attract

722
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,429
attention and the worst of all I believe

723
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:52,340
are the attacks against IT security

724
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,549
products and I believe that attracts

725
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:58,300
like the highest attention as

726
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,590
bear bear bear and the moment you go for

727
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:06,430
security companies you can be sure that

728
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,070
you will be caught so I don't think it's

729
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:12,220
probably unlikely that you'll get away

730
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,860
with hitting a security company and in

731
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,840
the end you have to keep in mind that

732
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,830
yes we're all just mortals here but we

733
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,800
are just doing our jobs I believe maybe

734
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,810
we can find better jobs all right so

735
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:32,380
what we want to do now now that you guys

736
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,540
have heard all these arguments let's try

737
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,500
to see who believes that the spooks are

738
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,050
waiting or who believes that the IT

739
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:44,650
security companies have the upper hand

740
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:47,200
in this war so let's do like a very

741
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,480
quick check for the spooks so who things

742
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,550
as spooks are winning the war

743
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:55,390
raise your hands come on my people all

744
00:32:55,390 --> 00:33:00,690
right all right that's a bit worrying

745
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,890
so who thinks that the IT security

746
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,500
companies are winning the situation

747
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,690
nowadays and as disappointed we are no I

748
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,300
would say I was like 60% for this books

749
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:18,050
and 40% for the AV security industry

750
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:21,890
like I think the most interesting thing

751
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:25,250
here is we did this exercise before so

752
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,140
first of all we did it at a spooks

753
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,380
conference at the spooks conference the

754
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:36,380
spooks won with 95% so we did again at a

755
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,810
hackers conference and the spooks again

756
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,510
won with 60% so we we thought we're

757
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,670
gonna do it requires bulletin and the AV

758
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:46,670
industry will win what it seems not I'm

759
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:50,810
sorry alright so we want to thank you

760
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,420
very much for listening to our speech

761
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,170
and if you still think there's hope for

762
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:00,830
the AV industry or if you think the war

763
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,920
is lost please feel free to shoot any

764
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:10,429
questions or ideas you may have and you

765
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:11,510
can have any questions they'd like to

766
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:16,300
ask or your oldest to stunt

767
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,310
there's no 3sat Virus Bulletin please

768
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:22,580
don't be intimidated this one right at

769
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,270
the back there

770
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,870
Oh Maya there's a there's a question

771
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:30,679
from spook here I saw you raised your

772
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:37,030
both hands for the spooks let's shake

773
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:42,290
not so much a question but but a comment

774
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,179
why why I raised my hands when I think

775
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:46,520
that the security industry is winning

776
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,480
because probably the best effect off of

777
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,860
what you guys did what what other

778
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,179
companies have done and what what ed

779
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:55,399
snowden has done is it's not just the

780
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:58,010
fact that they found a lot of malware I

781
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,570
found a lot of bad things happening but

782
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,540
that's if you're a spook you know that

783
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,920
there's a reasonable chance that what

784
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,390
you're doing is going to be detected

785
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:08,750
which means that if you're gonna

786
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,000
what you told me is a 78 year old

787
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,559
cryptographer in Belgium next next year

788
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:17,000
then you're gonna think twice about that

789
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,349
because you know this will look really

790
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,539
embarrassing if they find out you might

791
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:23,240
still attack Merkel's in fact Merkel's

792
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,640
aide because that's that's spear nice

793
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,599
which is as all this humanity but I

794
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,369
think there's a side the fact that the

795
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:33,680
people that despise while there might be

796
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,829
winning technical why they might they're

797
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:40,279
still going to be more restricted about

798
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:41,210
what they're going to do because they

799
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,130
know and if they don't know their bosses

800
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,200
will know that they will have to justify

801
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,599
directions at some point in the future

802
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:48,740
at least as a good chance that will have

803
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,079
some all right thank you

804
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:54,339
all right and our favorites cook from

805
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:58,369
Israel was gonna ask us no question it's

806
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:00,140
not so much a question as a comment I

807
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,539
think that first of all I like to talk

808
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:04,099
think it's an amazing discussion and it

809
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:06,260
should be had and there's one thing that

810
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,230
I think needs to be said that aside from

811
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:12,099
the damages that whatever the spooks do

812
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:14,299
actually takes place and you can do all

813
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:15,980
the morality talks about yes it's only

814
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,049
government are not the regular people I

815
00:36:18,049 --> 00:36:20,750
think the real problem is that once you

816
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,089
guys publish that technology then just

817
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:25,299
criminal people get ideas so we have

818
00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:28,119
technology doing a lot of proliferation

819
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,650
which is maybe another reason why spooks

820
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,089
needs to be need to be more careful

821
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:33,890
because at the end of the day it's not

822
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,359
just government fighting other

823
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,250
governments or governments fighting big

824
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,799
corporations because the criminals are

825
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:41,150
using the new tricks that they learn

826
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,950
from the spooks against people like my

827
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,220
dad and that's a problem yeah see a very

828
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,740
good point so to be honest this is I

829
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,119
think why a lot of companies have

830
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:54,289
stopped sharing zero-days and I think

831
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:56,690
the best example is the Duke you zero

832
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,690
day and I think Baldy had a sample of

833
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,910
that zero that we had a sample and for

834
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,319
the reason I was so powerful and

835
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:06,079
dangerous we didn't share it with anyone

836
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,779
I mean except Microsoft in order to fix

837
00:37:08,779 --> 00:37:10,900
it but nevertheless the bad guys

838
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,520
reverse-engineer the patch and about one

839
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,529
year later it was the most popular zero

840
00:37:15,529 --> 00:37:17,869
day in the wild so I think even if you

841
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:20,359
don't write about it sooner or later if

842
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:20,930
that calm

843
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,089
out through a patch the bad guys will

844
00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:25,910
still find ways to reverse engineer and

845
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:30,220
and use it against pretty much anyone

846
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,230
let's thank you for that Shalom

847
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:36,200
let's do the back there all right Nick

848
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,790
thank you

849
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,230
your voice is better yeah

850
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:44,230
doesn't sound right it's not a question

851
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,289
it's just a comment about what embossing

852
00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:49,119
basically boils down to the spooks

853
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:56,349
parents aren't proud of them I disagree

854
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:59,020
with that they think I work at the State

855
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:03,609
Department all right so even though more

856
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:06,980
questions thank you very much again

857
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:13,929
[Applause]
