2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,470
good morning everyone my name is John a

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,970
hug from the University Calgary and I'll

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,790
be cheering the session today so our

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,269
first speakers i tell you i was i was

6
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:19,880
shocked shocked to learn that home

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,800
network devices might not be secure and

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,230
our first speakers are going to tell us

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,410
all about that pavel ceramic and Martin

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,949
SH Marta

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,100
good morning ladies and gentlemen I'm

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,230
marking my colleague here is Pavel they

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,990
are working at Ava's virus lab now for

14
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,780
some three years and we would like to

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,100
tell you something about our latest

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,350
project which is a trying to address

17
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,989
problem of insecurity of home network

18
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,660
devices we have already heard several

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,280
excellent talks about those issues so we

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,280
want to propose a solution I would like

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,530
to start with a question can you guess

22
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,979
what this is obviously it's light bulb

23
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,380
but not an ordinary one this one is

24
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,800
special this is the oldest shining light

25
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,800
bulb in a world it's supposed to shine

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,210
sits since nineteen oh one but the time

27
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,660
goes quickly evolution progress so our

28
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,580
current light bulbs which you can buy at

29
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,790
the market have Wi-Fi connection to your

30
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,420
mobile phone and through that app you

31
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,880
can control its color its intensity it

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,040
means does the processor in this slide

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,220
bolt is a small computer which also oh

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,740
well which certainly brings us new

35
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,710
security issues i would like to you i

36
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,509
would like to tell you a short story

37
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,929
about development of home networks at

38
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:53,910
the beginning the first time we can

39
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,700
consider it network as a direct

40
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,550
connection from the internet to your

41
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,280
router and to your computer accessories

42
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,649
are connected to the computer why i will

43
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,758
USB and there are attacks they are a

44
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,590
texting on the computer not at the

45
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,800
infrastructure but our products and

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,380
auntie viruses are there to stop those

47
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,860
attacks the network grows we are getting

48
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,190
more devices cell phone laptops and they

49
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,040
are getting attacked and we move our

50
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,370
presence there to protect them about the

51
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,430
story continues the network is becoming

52
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,190
more complex we are getting smart TVs we

53
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,800
are getting network attached storage the

54
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,240
USB printers became

55
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,300
printers connected directly to the

56
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,150
router and they're starting the text to

57
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,460
against the devices and even the

58
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,620
infrastructure itself and not own life

59
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,070
directly through the internet but as a

60
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,740
trampoline attacks from your computers

61
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,260
the question is what can we do as an

62
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,360
industry about that because we cannot

63
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,240
install our products into TVs obviously

64
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,570
now since this is about the latest

65
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,150
buzzword the Internet of Things I would

66
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,270
like to make one thing clear the things

67
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,130
in the internet of things are not real

68
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,590
things there are still computers tiny

69
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,350
embedded computers but still computers

70
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,390
with everything that makes them which

71
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,400
means they usually run embedded Linux

72
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,660
and since most manufacturers want to get

73
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,520
them out of the factory as quickly as

74
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,430
possible that Linux is usually close to

75
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,560
the default settings of whatever the

76
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,620
distribution they chose to base it on

77
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,210
typically they are controlled with

78
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,360
web-based user interface since many of

79
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,010
the things don't have a screen and

80
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,470
keyboard but that obviously make them

81
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,960
need a web server for the web-based user

82
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,180
interface so and they put a lightweight

83
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,120
web server there run CGI scripts or an

84
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,360
arcade version of PHP and call shell

85
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,970
scripts from that in some cases even

86
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,830
under root the manufacturers although

87
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,320
the device is at least in case of the

88
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,298
cheaper ones which makeup on so the

89
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:21,399
market they see no need for additional

90
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,490
security because since it's on the home

91
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,260
network that's supposed to be secure so

92
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,050
why bother right so there's usually no

93
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,640
HTTPS and the vendors usually don't even

94
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,620
release firmware update fixing security

95
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,510
holes because they're already working on

96
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,200
the next model down the line since their

97
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,790
line of thought is hey they already

98
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,910
bought that no value in instill meddling

99
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,510
with it we better make the next device

100
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,510
work and ship it as soon as possible

101
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,950
it's obviously a huge flaw in in how the

102
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,530
industry works but unfortunately that's

103
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,940
the way it is here are examples of how

104
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,000
bad guys are starting to abuse the fact

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,340
that home devices are very poorly

106
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,380
secured what you see here is an example

107
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,450
of what we call a trampoline attack and

108
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,580
it's it's web-based malware from

109
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,610
februari this year we call it HTML DNS

110
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,130
changer but it's actually both HTML and

111
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,010
JavaScript this malware gets loaded by

112
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,440
the victims browser and that may be any

113
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,140
browser including an iPhone and actually

114
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,350
does not target the device which is

115
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,640
running the browser it targets the

116
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,030
router you can see that it makes it

117
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,800
tries to guess the address of of the

118
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,930
router 192 168 11 and it tries to guess

119
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,660
the username and password in in this

120
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,990
case admin admin and what it actually

121
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,130
does it sends one HTTP GET request to

122
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,110
change the rotors dns settings and

123
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,300
that's really the point for the

124
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,920
attackers because when they change the

125
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,230
dns on the router then any traffic going

126
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,940
through the router is going to be

127
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,950
intercepted at the dns level which is

128
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,440
enough for them to supply phishing pages

129
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,590
instead of web banking or to inject

130
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,560
advertisements into any page that loads

131
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,270
a common resource another kind of attack

132
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,270
that targets home devices or

133
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,730
specifically Reuters in this case is a

134
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,800
direct one and this is a very recent

135
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,370
malware called en scan I will not go

136
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,410
into detail of what the molar actually

137
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,200
does but the method it spreads by is i

138
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,650
would say disheartening it just scans a

139
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,170
subset of the ipv4 public range and

140
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,860
tries to connect via ssh when it finds

141
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,790
an open port it dries totally bland

142
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,840
default credentials and unfortunately

143
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,810
sometimes it succeeds once installed it

144
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,860
opens a backdoor

145
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,020
and scans another under part of the AP

146
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,580
for range so leaving ssh open to the

147
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,919
white area network port while still

148
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:17,740
having and still having default

149
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,900
credentials on the box is very poor

150
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,810
practice from the manufacturer to have

151
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,580
this by default because if it wasn't

152
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,069
default this worm wouldn't have been so

153
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:30,610
successful which brings me to the root

154
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,289
issue for for those two attacks the

155
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,610
passwords are used to authenticate

156
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,060
access to those devices have many

157
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,250
problems first there are default bearers

158
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,580
that are very easy to hook up and almost

159
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,639
nobody changes them sometimes there are

160
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,229
even backdoor pairs of default username

161
00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:00,099
and password which are available but not

162
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:03,550
mentioned in the user manual and stay

163
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,469
there even if the user changes it but

164
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:08,199
most users even if they change their

165
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,759
route or password they change it to a

166
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,949
very poor one because as we all know

167
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:16,419
there's a statistic of the 100 or 10 or

168
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:19,779
5 worst passwords ever that gets on the

169
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:23,289
newspaper front page every quarter it

170
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:27,759
doesn't matter well what are the hints

171
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,650
for choosing the password the user is

172
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,360
going to choose one two three four five

173
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,169
or password with a zero and the malware

174
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:37,328
writers know this and abuse this and try

175
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:40,599
these weak passwords and succeed what we

176
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:43,809
believe causes this is the fact that the

177
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,209
setup procedure for those devices is

178
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:49,720
fundamentally flawed the vendors at

179
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,019
least again in case of the cheaper end

180
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:56,740
of the spectrum do realize that setting

181
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,570
up the router changing settings is a

182
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,300
complicated task so their solution is

183
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,730
not to make it easy for the user their

184
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,250
solution is to skip it at all and just

185
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,899
tell the user to plug it in the wall and

186
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:11,620
leave it on running the defaults this

187
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,570
allows Muller to try the defaults very

188
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,630
easily but

189
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,230
why is it this way I think there's a

190
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,870
better way if you buy a new android

191
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,240
phone you take it out of the box and it

192
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,620
walks you through a very nice setup

193
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,180
screen that helps you with security

194
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,160
tells you what's a strong password and

195
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,070
how to set up your account is there a

196
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,550
problem having a six-page wizard when

197
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,170
you first turn on the router and connect

198
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,110
to it via HTTP I don't think so it's

199
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,410
just poor motivation on the vendors part

200
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,740
that will be changed and it is not just

201
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,250
a poor setup it's a poor design of the

202
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,770
system itself northland default linux

203
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,670
with open ports these are statistics

204
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,250
from rotors because we see it in the

205
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,490
wild it's understandable it has HTTP /

206
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,860
port open bye why does it have down at

207
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,790
FTP or SSH it doesn't need them to

208
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,930
function and our preliminary scans shows

209
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,720
that there are other issues like open

210
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,960
ports to the Internet probably high

211
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,740
check dns poor settings at Wi-Fi without

212
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,970
encryption or with very weak one and

213
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,620
there are vulnerabilities which can be

214
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,110
easily exploited for example the famous

215
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,520
one from zero to sum this up the state

216
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,340
of customer devices is not good we are

217
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,140
getting more devices with more

218
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,370
vulnerabilities without updates and the

219
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,830
attacks are popping up the attackers see

220
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:53,560
value in these devices and we should do

221
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,600
something about that we should try to

222
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,800
change this paint what we believe should

223
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,730
be done first and foremost is raised

224
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,730
user awareness that device in security

225
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,190
is a thing this was already mentioned

226
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:13,060
here yesterday people know that Windows

227
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,470
PCs get viruses people do not know that

228
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,870
Reuters get attacked and unfortunately

229
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,110
this carries on to the thinking of the

230
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,450
manufacturers all those devices and they

231
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,020
do not care about security what we want

232
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,730
to

233
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,310
pose is to detect the most common issues

234
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,560
including the bad passwords including

235
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,620
the bad security practice and the holes

236
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,399
that that brings and inform and educate

237
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,420
the users about those security problems

238
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:49,050
the first step is making them know then

239
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,389
we can offer them help to mitigate the

240
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:53,339
problems if there is a solution

241
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,750
available and if it is an easy one such

242
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,510
as changing the password we make we may

243
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:05,699
even try to logon through it but the

244
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:07,589
point is we don't want to end up as

245
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:09,690
secured as the bike in the picture we

246
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,529
don't want to overwhelm the users with

247
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:15,800
constant notifications about incoming

248
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,990
tcp syn packets or whatever might be

249
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,870
coming onto network we need some

250
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,820
prioritization of what are the important

251
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,360
issues and ironically the dark side is

252
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,790
here to help us prioritize this we

253
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,620
should of course start with the issues

254
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,220
that are being used for attacks now

255
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,350
since we can't install an antivirus

256
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:42,240
software in in router or in a TV at

257
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,180
least not for now we can't protect we

258
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,839
can prevent so our proposed solution is

259
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,470
to integrate an automated network

260
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,990
security scanner in consumer antivirus

261
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,370
and security solutions we do not want to

262
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,380
recreate professional network scanning

263
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,540
tools they're already light years ahead

264
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,269
in in how they scan the network and

265
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:08,579
their databases but they are not

266
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,250
intended for home use they are intended

267
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,579
for professionals who know what securing

268
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,319
a network means they know what what's a

269
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:19,889
pen test we want to address those people

270
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:22,260
that don't even know they should secure

271
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,680
their network and that is what our tool

272
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,630
targets we want to offer them help with

273
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,829
preventing the situation where they have

274
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:37,279
open holes in their small network and

275
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,170
attackers are free to abuse them we can

276
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,970
detect those holes and we can

277
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,579
offer that education and help and all

278
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:53,170
them so to scan for vulnerabilities we

279
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,930
need to know what to scan for we decided

280
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,060
to classify the vulnerabilities into

281
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,699
three major groups the first group in

282
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:04,060
our biz do is a bed configuration week

283
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,899
cryptography default settings it's the

284
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:09,910
best group from our point of view

285
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,970
because it's easy to fix usually it to

286
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,889
fix it means to guide users through

287
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:18,279
settings and tell them how to change how

288
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:22,810
to change it the second group is far

289
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,379
more serious they are device specific

290
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:28,750
vulnerabilities there are errors which

291
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,259
are specific for some model for some

292
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:35,319
manufacturer they are usually not dead

293
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:37,810
widespread but they are harder to fix

294
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,589
because fixing them means disabling

295
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,019
vulnerable services in better case in

296
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:46,600
worst case patching the firmware of the

297
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,149
device which is hurting to do most

298
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:52,600
commonly users don't have the skills to

299
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,930
do that and the patch is not always

300
00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:00,370
available the last group is the

301
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,620
vulnerabilities which get names like

302
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,559
room 0 he'll choke or other famous one

303
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,769
they are the most problematic because

304
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:11,259
there are bugs in libraries or systems

305
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:15,279
usually and the effect entire industry

306
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,180
of devices to fix them means to purge

307
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,149
them with firmware update which has to

308
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:24,370
be released by all of the device vendors

309
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,500
which is not likely to happen scanning

310
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,689
for these vulnerabilities is by nature

311
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:34,089
algorithmic detection we need to send

312
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:36,670
some probe and by the response we can

313
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,379
judge whether there is a vulnerability

314
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:41,860
or not this bring us some the dis bring

315
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,800
us some pitfalls to avoid for example

316
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,470
those probes can be destructive we can

317
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,779
send pro twitch mykos to reboot the

318
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:52,240
device even worse which make to

319
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,120
completely break it or break it settings

320
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,180
which is something we cannot do at our

321
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,270
consumer network so we need to be very

322
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,260
careful which probes we sent there are

323
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,430
there there is an alternative we can try

324
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,910
a different approach by flagging do

325
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,980
vulnerabilities in some table and

326
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,880
searching it with vendor device so

327
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,220
version firmware aberration but this is

328
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,490
not that reliable solution other problem

329
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,880
is utilization of network resources we

330
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,370
don't want to do a denial of service on

331
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,920
our internal scan scan network so

332
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,470
parallel probing may be a problem we may

333
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,070
float the devices which are created from

334
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,440
cube components and can barely handle

335
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,520
the typical load the other problem is we

336
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,450
can we can hammer the device we are

337
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,640
scanning itself we can have not the

338
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,610
router itself the network instead of

339
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,190
circa we want to avoid this problem so

340
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,560
we need to balance careful bonds our

341
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,030
scanning efforts just to add to that the

342
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,619
low-end devices barely have the

343
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,150
computing power to do the job they were

344
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,209
designed to do if you try to guess

345
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:12,819
passwords or send probes to whatever

346
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,740
services are running at the same time

347
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,329
the user is trying to load a YouTube

348
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:18,790
video there's a very high chance that

349
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,400
you will end up unintentionally do

350
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,670
essing the users experience which is of

351
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:30,070
course bad now to show an example of the

352
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,350
probes that can be done easily and

353
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,750
safely I mean by and by that I mean

354
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,990
non-destructive and simple one request

355
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,200
without hammering we have the already

356
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,270
mentioned famous from zero vulnerability

357
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,730
this is a vulnerability in the wrong

358
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,400
page or web server by Allegro and it

359
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:56,220
manifests itself by by this very simple

360
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,670
loop where you look it manifests itself

361
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,720
as as a response to a get request to

362
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,210
slash rum dash 0 and this response

363
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:12,140
HTTP 200 ok code and in the body of that

364
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,260
HTTP response there's the binary

365
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,260
contents of a significant chunk of

366
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,380
memory which means to probe for this you

367
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,720
just need to send one request and look

368
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,800
at what you get usually you expect a 404

369
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,080
if you get 200 and binary that device is

370
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,590
vulnerable to run 0 another simple one

371
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,460
to check that's not based on HTTP is a

372
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,490
lesser known security hole in unplugs

373
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,430
devices it's a Miss configuration issue

374
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,610
in there embedded Linux and it manifests

375
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,970
itself by the fact that when you connect

376
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,030
via the rsync protocol and navigate to

377
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,850
the unclogs folder on that device what

378
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,770
you actually get is read and write

379
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,140
access to the root filesystem of the

380
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,910
embedded Linux that is of course trivial

381
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,640
to check again by just implementing a

382
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,590
very small subset of arcing and looking

383
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:13,040
at the results of of opening the unplug

384
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,280
folder and both of those probes do not

385
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,380
wreck the device they leave it still

386
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,510
usable and allow us to inform the user

387
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,910
that there is a security problem that

388
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:28,670
hackers can potentially abuse which

389
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,400
brings me to the question of what to

390
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,060
target we want to target holes like this

391
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,330
that are safe to check and affect a lot

392
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,730
of users from zero is a good example of

393
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,870
that as with everything the 8020 rule

394
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,880
stands here so that means that

395
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,070
approximately twenty percent of security

396
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,520
holes affect approximately eighty

397
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:57,040
percent of of the user base that means

398
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,680
we want to go after those few prominent

399
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,800
holes that that affect a lot of people

400
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,540
first and as I mentioned the attackers

401
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,340
already do that they go after the

402
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,040
low-hanging fruit so we should try to

403
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,440
prevent them from doing it how to

404
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,200
achieve this it's by having to feedback

405
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,950
loops

406
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,860
the first outer one is having the

407
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,640
scanner and provide real work telemetry

408
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,380
back to our backend of course and using

409
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,860
this telemetry to identify those twenty

410
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,840
percent of highly prevalent and

411
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,530
dangerous vulnerabilities and

412
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,390
prioritizing the implementation of the

413
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,830
probes because since they are

414
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,080
algorithmic detections someone has to

415
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,280
write the code for them the inner loop

416
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,920
is prioritization in the engine itself

417
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,580
which means scanning the local network

418
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,190
and only applying the probes that make

419
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,490
sense for whatever is on the network

420
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,110
we're not going to try everything we

421
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,630
have on every device because that would

422
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,180
run exactly into that unintentional

423
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,220
denial of service issue on low-end

424
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,620
devices and lengthen the skin so how

425
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,500
does our scanning engine look like after

426
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,620
some starting event which may be user

427
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,920
interaction or just some times some

428
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,420
timer the engine first checks the device

429
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,940
is running on we check the internet

430
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,800
connection of the device whether the

431
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,040
connection is secure whether it is if

432
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,550
it's they are Wi-Fi whether it's

433
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:44,180
properly set up and encrypted we take

434
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,850
the DNS whether it's likely to be hijack

435
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,120
or not we check other stuff then we are

436
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,940
we start to scan the network for the

437
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,460
devices this means we need to discover

438
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,060
those devices by different metals like I

439
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:04,220
RP scan or upnp scan and other methods

440
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,550
but even though this discover gives us

441
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,800
some interesting data for example MAC

442
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,620
address of the device which can tell us

443
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:17,360
the manufacturer then we want to get

444
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,520
more information about the device if we

445
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,230
want to scan the device we get to know

446
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,840
it first and they need to get it no well

447
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,090
so we are trying to get as much

448
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,900
information as we can

449
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,420
about what which services are running

450
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,720
there which ports are open and other

451
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,840
stuff like that this information helps

452
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,990
us to choose which detection probes to

453
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:44,190
perform in order to be fast and not to

454
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,710
harm the device so we send our

455
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,050
addictions probes we get our responses

456
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:55,680
and we we take the data we get we do

457
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,930
that for all the devices we found on the

458
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,480
network for further devices we consider

459
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,720
important and we report the state to the

460
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,730
user if there is a vulnerability found

461
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,040
we report it as we mentioned we want to

462
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,490
inform the user about those issues this

463
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,830
is a screenshot from our beta version

464
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,100
it's not very nice but it gives you an

465
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,350
idea it shows the important information

466
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,570
that is which problem was found on the

467
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:29,910
device which risk it presents to the to

468
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,370
the customer possible solution with some

469
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,950
additional information as we want to

470
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,890
educate users and this example is a

471
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:41,990
particular vulnerability in suitors a

472
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:47,250
which unfortunately this sent out the

473
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,670
current administration password in clear

474
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,700
text in the HTML code of the page in a

475
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,400
comment or in actual energy of a script

476
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,460
comparison or and even if you change the

477
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,420
password it gets sent again into the

478
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,340
client and he can just look at the

479
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,960
source code and type in whatever is

480
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,730
there in that comparison you can delete

481
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,070
it I read it in which occurred which

482
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,340
translates to that message that hackers

483
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,220
can easily obtain your administration

484
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,250
password and gain complete control of

485
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:24,120
the router so we have our security

486
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,070
scanner but there are some issues to

487
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,830
address you know it's not a silver

488
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,380
bullet we have the first great problem

489
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,110
we have is how to help users fix those

490
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,670
issues we find

491
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:38,790
in many occasions there is not no fix

492
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:42,210
available there in other equations there

493
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,550
the fixes available but it's hard to

494
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,940
apply how can we help our users for

495
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,330
example my mama to fix the device if he

496
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,510
has no knowledge about computer security

497
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:58,200
the other program is reporting those

498
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,690
issues there are networks where we don't

499
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:03,660
want to report our security security

500
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,420
breaches or something like that imagine

501
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,410
free Wi-Fi so like in McDonald's or

502
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,270
corporate networks we are creating

503
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,330
scanner for homes and a secure networks

504
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,000
but it definitely gets around in

505
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,480
different networks as well and we want

506
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,820
to cause harm which brings me to the

507
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,030
last point we don't want to create a

508
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,760
hacking to user friendly hacking too so

509
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,220
we need to devise our scanner to help to

510
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,190
protect but not to help to harm the

511
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,760
problem is that the probes we send our

512
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,820
unfortunately of the same nature as the

513
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,970
request sent in actual attacks this is

514
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,670
unavoidable but we at least need to

515
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:51,540
design it so that we do not run it in a

516
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,720
network works where ipss are present so

517
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,850
that our probes don't get flagged and we

518
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,860
also want to design a tool it's such a

519
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,620
way that those probes are of no use for

520
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,070
actual hacking and by that it in fact

521
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,920
means that those who want to hack will

522
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,100
look at some other kind of tool and not

523
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,890
use our scatter for that because we

524
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:17,930
can't stop them for us now in

525
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:21,360
anticipation of a question from the

526
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,280
audience that is that was sure going to

527
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,710
happen I would like to answer it first

528
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,810
here have we tried contacting the

529
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:30,570
vendors with this the anthems answer is

530
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,110
no at least not yet because we have

531
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,820
already seen the previous talks on

532
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,070
device insecurity and we have seen the

533
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:42,330
results of those researchers on last

534
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,590
year's virus bulletin there was an

535
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:46,380
excellent talk by David Jacoby named how

536
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,889
I hacked my own house

537
00:26:47,889 --> 00:26:50,360
david was dealing with trampoline

538
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,659
attacks and while he eventually

539
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:56,210
succeeded with contacting the vendors of

540
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,580
the reverses he found vulnerable it took

541
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,740
him quite the journey to get there and

542
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,149
he had to use his own personal contacts

543
00:27:05,149 --> 00:27:08,269
in the industry to get hold of someone

544
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:12,019
competent at at the company that made

545
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:14,630
the vulnerable device others were not as

546
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,940
lucky as David and the vendors didn't

547
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,740
respond at all so that brings me to the

548
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,990
final point of this presentation we

549
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,510
because we me and Martin we re on young

550
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,850
and naive we would like to try and make

551
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,529
an appeal to the security community here

552
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:39,320
we should stop just alerting ourselves

553
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,769
that devices are insecure we should

554
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:44,809
alert those who actually buy those

555
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:47,779
devices because vendors care about

556
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,409
selling them once they're sold it's over

557
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:55,389
those who have the choosing power of

558
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:58,370
having a secure or insecure device are

559
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,889
the users were not even aware that

560
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:05,539
device in security is a thing if we all

561
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:08,419
integrate automated scanners in one form

562
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:10,429
or another in to our security solutions

563
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:14,899
then we can at least try to exert some

564
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:18,139
pressure on the vendors but we can only

565
00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:22,789
do so and by informing the users if we

566
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:25,100
mail the vendors that their devices are

567
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,049
insecure we are going to get ignored

568
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:29,779
because we do not affect the sales if

569
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:33,559
the users start picking the more secure

570
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:37,010
devices then security becomes a

571
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,409
competitive advantage and when that

572
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:42,409
happens this cycle may start to be

573
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:46,100
self-sustaining and the global landscape

574
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,750
of device security may start to improve

575
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,760
until the users know that this is a

576
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,250
problem the situation will only be

577
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,559
getting worse and we can't blame the

578
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:02,440
vendors because they do what companies

579
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,510
so we would like to thank the rest of

580
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:11,030
our team at have asked without whom this

581
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,770
project would never have been possible

582
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,490
this was not a two-man show so thanks

583
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:21,050
guys and this is the end of the talk so

584
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,970
if anyone has questions and we have time

585
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,730
for them do we or not you'll have to say

586
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:30,490
it enough to break I'm afraid nope okay

587
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:38,579
[Applause]
