1
00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:03,510
okay we're going to begin our next

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,480
presentation and Martin swimmer and

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,300
really and Nick Fitzgerald have been

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,190
friends of mine and mentors in the

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,530
industry for a long time and I have no

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,330
doubt they're going to have a highly

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,480
interesting presentation and Nick didn't

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,850
for me that in fact the Kobayashi Maru

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,070
dilemma is not how to choose your sushi

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:37,380
I don't believe in a no-win scenario you

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,540
are looking at the owner Starfleet cadet

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,899
ever beat the no-win scenario I don't

13
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,980
believe in Owen scenarios I teendreams

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,620
altamonte Essex we have struggled

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,990
Kobayashi Maru scenario frequent lyrics

16
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,410
habit students and equipment as I recall

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,970
and you took the test three times

18
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,120
yourself your final solution what shall

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,420
we say unique tips the Kobayashi Maru no

20
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,280
one passed tests and no one goes back

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,020
for seconds let alone d'oeuvres the

22
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,420
Kobayashi Marus will you tell me what

23
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,390
you

24
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,729
i reprogrammed the simulation so it's

25
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,150
possibly arrest

26
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,110
I so

27
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,320
all of the ships no one on board was

28
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,469
injured and the successful rescue of the

29
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:33,649
Kobayashi Maru crew is underway I don't

30
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:41,689
like lose you'll have to deal with me

31
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:46,369
I've got laryngitis but that made any

32
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:50,360
sense yeah and he's going to take over

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,679
if I fall over my voice completely dies

34
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:56,119
anyway that was just a little

35
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:59,090
introduction obviously to explain the

36
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,280
title of the paper and the point was the

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,250
Kirk didn't like losing didn't believe

38
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,349
in though in situations and he was in a

39
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:08,419
position where he could actually change

40
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,480
the game and so we did all you could say

41
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,130
he cheated and the whole thought that

42
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,989
sort of trade off this paper was are

43
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:19,880
there things that we can do to change

44
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,680
the game so that we're not always

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,829
running playing second fiddle trying to

46
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:30,859
play catch-up um this is just I was

47
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,269
going to read these and explain them but

48
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:35,090
I'm not for obvious reasons you'll be a

49
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,639
second Orion there's an odd place to

50
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,500
start perhaps but that sort of makes

51
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,630
sense something what was the best thing

52
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:50,019
about office 97 maybe it was clever you

53
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,569
can't tell from that slide but that's

54
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:56,480
the visual basic for applications who

55
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,889
was the new much more advanced macro

56
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,560
development environment that was in

57
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,859
several of the office 97 applications

58
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:10,819
particularly word and excel and the bad

59
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,829
guys that wrote macro viruses really

60
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:15,920
liked it too a little bout a little more

61
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,730
about that in a second

62
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:23,420
what was the worst thing about office 97

63
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,900
does anyone know what that is yeah does

64
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,980
anyone not know what concept yeah very

65
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,170
good wasn't I wasn't bad in any way at

66
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,069
all couldn't possibly be um the point is

67
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:41,790
that by the time office 97 k now there

68
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,549
was been a very large macro virus

69
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:46,489
problem and I was just getting worse and

70
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:49,230
Microsoft in the early days had been

71
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,870
very it's not really a big issue and

72
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,530
they didn't take really serious steps to

73
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,430
try to an implement i'm sure people a

74
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,109
microsoft look at what could be done but

75
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:03,299
to actually implement useful and

76
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,730
successful strategy changes that might

77
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,590
have made it very difficult for the

78
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,989
macro right macro virus writers to

79
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:13,889
continue anyway so the worst thing about

80
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:17,370
office 97 I wasn't concept the worst

81
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,399
thing about office 97 weird 97 rather in

82
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,419
particular was this macro security joke

83
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,800
that Microsoft put in it if you open the

84
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,349
document and a default installation have

85
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:33,949
you opened a document that a macro in it

86
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:39,080
this warning would pop up and it often

87
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,460
depends and a whole lot of her

88
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,349
that no one wanted to read or understand

89
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,699
because they just wanted to get on and

90
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,159
get their work done and explained who

91
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,800
try to explain that mcevoy macros might

92
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,110
be bad they might do bad things she

93
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,789
might not want them to run and it gave

94
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:55,440
you the option to disable the metro and

95
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,380
keep opening Leichman to enable the

96
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,690
macro and keep opening document or to

97
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,849
not open the document all a lot of

98
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:04,979
people of course took the default but

99
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,020
quite a few people based on their

100
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,880
experience with the high quality of

101
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,280
windows and other microsoft software you

102
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,380
much painful experience that if you

103
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,080
disable anything usually something bad

104
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,789
would happen you wouldn't be able to

105
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:20,449
print something yeah it's like and so a

106
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:23,699
significant not large but a significant

107
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,409
number of people at some point or other

108
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,870
folk perfectly not good

109
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,910
but what they thought would might be

110
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,550
would click the enable macros and the

111
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,620
reason that's a problem is the macro

112
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,710
could do anything including turn off the

113
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,960
CD that made this morning appear so you

114
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,010
would never see it again okay what was

115
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,750
the best thing about office two thousand

116
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,290
and where 2,000 Microsoft got serious at

117
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,020
long last after enormous complaints from

118
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,690
the user base about macro viruses and

119
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,510
they put a much he is a macro severity

120
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:03,540
modeling and by default by default it

121
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,270
was set too high and the good thing

122
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,820
about high macro virus security and

123
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,540
office were 2,000 was that if you ran

124
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,910
with it said hi and you opened any

125
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,180
document with a macro in it it only gave

126
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,370
you the option to disable the bloody

127
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,320
things okay the example here is a

128
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,900
document that had assigned the macro and

129
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,550
that was validly signed by a certificate

130
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,580
that track back down the chain and so in

131
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,550
that case you the words in the middle

132
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,440
would depending on the exact scenario

133
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,660
but in that case we had a valid you

134
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,480
signed macro you could click the we

135
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,220
always trust macros from the source and

136
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,840
then you be able to enable the macros

137
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,730
and then any future document you got

138
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,300
ahead sign macros validly so macros from

139
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,460
the same source they would open and the

140
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,220
macros would be enabled in the document

141
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,780
as well why is that important the whole

142
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,030
were two thousand macoris unimodal vs.

143
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,740
the Joker that came before it's

144
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,930
important because this is what happened

145
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,820
to macro viruses which were an enormous

146
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,830
problem up to about 2001 2002 the

147
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,950
prevalence is plummeted okay so

148
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,410
Microsoft changed the game they made it

149
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,400
much charter for the end macro malware

150
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,330
to get its initial tow haul and and I

151
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,160
there were other things that happen as

152
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,099
well

153
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:41,150
and an hour malware landscape but the

154
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,539
bad guys eventually given up I think and

155
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:46,550
then they did I mean you can't actually

156
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,280
tell her on this graph but by by about

157
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,599
early 2004 macro virus prevalence macro

158
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,580
malware prevalence was basically as zero

159
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,039
percent and it's pretty much stayed

160
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:00,199
there until recently it's a definition

161
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,180
we weren't going to do so trying to

162
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,199
remember what I see in the same X good

163
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,009
guys one bad guys Nell and I can't

164
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:14,690
believe I'm seeing that about Microsoft

165
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,020
but I just take a photo before it goes

166
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,159
away oh I gotta give my voice a risk for

167
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:25,370
second so one of the things that was

168
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,050
really in kind of instructive in that

169
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,310
scenario that just talked about

170
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,770
and it's always the scenario in fact in

171
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,000
everything that we're going to look at

172
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,589
this this really could be said to be

173
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:37,760
true it is what it does is it changes

174
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,260
the game for a little while raises the

175
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,909
bar moves things around a little bit and

176
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,250
actually what Nick's graph just showed

177
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,600
you just there doesn't tell the whole

178
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,190
story because what actually happened

179
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,839
although malware for macros went away

180
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,579
that was really about the time that VBS

181
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:55,070
started on its rise and just the

182
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,019
attackers had to shift somewhere else

183
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:58,730
but of course there's a cost for them to

184
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,860
do so and they've been several other

185
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,899
security kind of game changes that we've

186
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:05,140
heard about talked about over the years

187
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,360
address space layout randomization

188
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,589
something that Linux had for a long time

189
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:11,810
took Microsoft a long long time to climb

190
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,970
on that bus they eventually did but by

191
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,560
then the attackers were already kind of

192
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,209
ahead of that game saw the writing on

193
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:19,670
the wall what was going to happen moved

194
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,610
on and were able to basically deal with

195
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,880
the fact that that ASL i was there

196
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,890
encryptions always been kind of a touted

197
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,860
as a as a way to get around you know

198
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,329
malware everything's encrypted you kind

199
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:33,440
of have your data stole and all that

200
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,670
kind of thing of course we know that

201
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,410
encryption biggest problem with

202
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,329
encryption is its implementation and

203
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:40,370
there are lots of bad implementations of

204
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,930
encryption lots of things and ultimately

205
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,779
it doesn't necessarily stop anything to

206
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:47,660
do with malware because ultimately a lot

207
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,760
of these things unfortunately malware

208
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,750
doesn't just infect hosts and things it

209
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,540
infects people's brains and not like

210
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,820
things that have infected Nick's throat

211
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,840
or something like that you know

212
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,640
sometimes the user is the vulnerable

213
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,710
part right so we thought we had a

214
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,480
presentation that would be great and it

215
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,160
gets infected and suddenly things are

216
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,610
all screwed up so a two-factor

217
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,410
authentication another thing very useful

218
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,020
tool very very powerful in in in in some

219
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,910
ways again implementations a problem and

220
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,350
also there were ways to subvert that

221
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,210
because you couldn't subvert the user or

222
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,640
you can maybe use the some malware to

223
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,650
subvert the process by which you're

224
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,910
getting your two-factor authentication

225
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,760
if you can steal the keys perhaps for

226
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,010
the seed for your for your token or if

227
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,750
you can infect them but the the phone

228
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,900
that generates your security key capture

229
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,580
was another thing you know it started

230
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,110
off very simple little things that you

231
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,760
just had to type in what the text said

232
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,800
and then the attacker said oh that's a

233
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,660
good idea why don't we use OCR let's do

234
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,640
OCR will extract that out we'll just by

235
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,710
dump it back in so then we made it much

236
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,330
more hard and now you get these blurry

237
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,580
images that nobody can even read so just

238
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,110
outsource it to Pakistan and those guys

239
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,520
give you an answer in three seconds flat

240
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,720
tile pitting you know slowing things

241
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,060
down if you see an unusual behavior just

242
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,920
just slow down throttle things don't let

243
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,140
the attacker you know exfiltrate all

244
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,790
your data so quickly all that kind of

245
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,490
stuff making things run slowly doesn't

246
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,440
really help your user experiences that

247
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,670
much and then of course you've got

248
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,350
economic measures and we've heard about

249
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,840
that today from Eagle talked about

250
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,020
taggants and I've talked about the way

251
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,910
that you can perhaps change the model

252
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,440
and make it more expensive for things

253
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,300
that have been things proposed for spam

254
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,580
have been things proposed for now just

255
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,200
to try and make things a little bit more

256
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,320
expensive for an attacker those things

257
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,960
do work they change the game but they

258
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,660
shifted elsewhere one of the big big

259
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,490
thing there's all these farmer scams all

260
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,040
those kind of spam that was coming out

261
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,660
that kind of went away because chrono

262
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,370
pay got shut down and all could process

263
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,740
their payments anymore so maybe a big

264
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,210
game changer is to get you know the

265
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,800
visas and the master cards of the world

266
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,220
to just aggressively shut down payment

267
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,740
gateways for for for these guys those

268
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,230
things are all game changes in some

269
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,440
senses because they shift focus but none

270
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:03,680
of

271
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:11,120
the final solution thanks Andy so I'm

272
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,160
going to run through a couple of very

273
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,890
esoteric things that aren't I'm not

274
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,930
proposing that these themselves are

275
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,790
things that might scale or things that

276
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,070
you would want to do but there are

277
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,779
questions raised along the way in the

278
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:25,550
next couple of minutes that any kind of

279
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,980
automated or semi-automated system yeah

280
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,860
you've got 10,000 100,000 vm sitting in

281
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,310
your server farm furiously analyzing you

282
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,990
are elves that are pouring in and you're

283
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,130
trying to work out whether it's good bad

284
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,440
or indifferent there's some there's some

285
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,899
issues that even when you're just doing

286
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:43,279
it manually rather than on an industrial

287
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,800
scale you maybe should be aware of what

288
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,630
you can't see on that screen shot bit so

289
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,330
I mean you can probably tell probably

290
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:54,320
tell it's an ebay fish um but this was

291
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,029
very very common once upon a time and

292
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:58,970
solve it disappeared but it's an ftp URL

293
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,580
and it's not only an ftp URL but it's an

294
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,790
ftp URL with a username and a password

295
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,940
so if you happen to have that first URL

296
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,130
in your potentially analyzing it looking

297
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,420
at where it came from the fish email

298
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,830
itself is during your set of user

299
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,020
credentials and a site that they belong

300
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,130
to is it okay like you can log in with

301
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,890
ftp is it okay to delete the phishing

302
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,930
page or to upload a replacement for the

303
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,600
phishing page that's just warning must

304
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,370
one what about logging into the hosting

305
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,880
provider for that site using those user

306
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,020
credentials and having a look around you

307
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,110
be able to depending on how the service

308
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,790
they offer and how its configured you

309
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,040
may get access to a lot more files than

310
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,839
just the stuff that's accessible through

311
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:57,230
that if DP interface what about copying

312
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,150
those files if there are some if there

313
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,620
are files that you can get to through

314
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,649
the control panel under face what about

315
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:05,839
copying them up looking and analyzing

316
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,610
him seeing of

317
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,839
there are pointers to other bad stuff

318
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:10,459
which you might want to protect your

319
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:16,310
users from and what in the old days when

320
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,640
this was common back in the early 2000s

321
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,470
it was also very common that the free

322
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,970
hosting the places had very very little

323
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,200
authentication beyond the fact that if

324
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,329
you could log in they'd let you check so

325
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:31,160
you could change the password or the

326
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,050
email address and the user account

327
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,570
through the control panel and it

328
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,880
wouldn't see an email to the original

329
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,279
address as a confirmation check or

330
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,860
anything like that would it be okay to

331
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,079
do that so you change the phishing page

332
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:47,209
so it's harmless so anyone you still got

333
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:49,010
the email and click on the link don't

334
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,399
get in trouble change the account

335
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,910
details so that the person who owned the

336
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,730
account can't log back in a changing

337
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,459
buzzer and change the email address so

338
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:03,560
that they can't recover it because they

339
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,360
now only then they can't prove that they

340
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,680
are owned those are hoping questions we

341
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,079
can move on the next example there's a

342
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,180
more contemporary example but almost the

343
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:20,449
same thing yes sir there's a paypal vish

344
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:24,050
and but you can't really see there that

345
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,000
horrible URL but you don't really need

346
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,910
to answer it serve chemical proof Loren

347
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,089
Coleman Indian company the dot-com

348
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:39,380
domain name and that's the that's the

349
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,300
phishing page and anyway so at this

350
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,160
point you've got the URL to the switch

351
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,820
page it's obviously think it's fairly

352
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,690
likely that at some a compromise server

353
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,790
someone's our fish somewhere off any

354
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,820
access to something agent is it okay to

355
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,800
take a round on that server using

356
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,579
directory traversal yeah chop the last

357
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:03,589
bit off the URL and see what happens to

358
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:07,730
chop the next bit of is that okay you

359
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,290
might find something interesting like a

360
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,589
fishing kit which might help you more

361
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:15,079
definitively to take more of the things

362
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:17,390
from the same cat in the future or maybe

363
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,980
you're fighting to data drop file and

364
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,540
depending on

365
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,250
what you're doing the responsibilities

366
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,250
of your coming maybe reporting the fraud

367
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,519
that's recorded in that file would be

368
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,899
something that you know that you wanted

369
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:30,850
an event your company does or you may

370
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,350
have a good working relationship with

371
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,899
the brand and beautiful that data to

372
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:36,699
them as well as informative valid for

373
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:39,790
sake keep monitoring you might even find

374
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,300
a shell and if you did as an ok so then

375
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,130
took around even deeper on that web

376
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:52,300
server now do as I say not as I do okay

377
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,690
if you're not the first level or the

378
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,480
last level of the URL redirects you to a

379
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,100
different version of the same year of

380
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,290
the centrifuge you go back to level so

381
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,490
it doesn't say mccovey's really was it

382
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,140
doesn't say you go back four levels and

383
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,530
you get this directory and it's full of

384
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,980
image files mostly young JPEGs and PNG's

385
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,569
they are PDF and the log directory at

386
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,400
the bottom is the next level down which

387
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,319
is the first fishing directory that

388
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,990
redirects you to a phishing page but a

389
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:29,950
few one half minute period n amongst all

390
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,600
those new American graphics files

391
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,870
there's a PHP file just one in the whole

392
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,370
page believe me I won't trying to prove

393
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:42,220
it ah and now you can go now you can go

394
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,200
looking around the recession that PHP

395
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,559
file does haven't be a shell and the

396
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,510
nice thing about this particular case is

397
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,210
the tongue I'd been looking for this kit

398
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,360
for ages and there it was so I could fly

399
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,010
me young I couldn't download it from

400
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,120
that directory without knowing his name

401
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,450
it's good an obscure name and but now I

402
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,429
found it using the shelf and I could do

403
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:05,380
billing spelunking around the rest of

404
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,700
the server which I'm not going to bore

405
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,230
you with now but um is that a good idea

406
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:17,650
so you Walter um I got again I think I

407
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,530
can get through this

408
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,720
dan Casper twas a penetration tester

409
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,510
working for ABN amro back in the early

410
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:29,070
2000s in the UK he um he was working on

411
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,080
new year's eve just after the indian

412
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,660
ocean tsunami and he decided he'd make a

413
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,490
donation to one of the charity one of

414
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,740
the big charities in the UK he went to

415
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,600
their website filled in the donation

416
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,520
form put in his credit card etc etc

417
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,530
filled in all the details hit submit and

418
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,510
it was very very slow the service

419
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,490
response was very very slow and he never

420
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,530
got a confirmation page I thank you

421
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,990
anything like that and then he and then

422
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,460
he sort of SAT there he thought actually

423
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,710
the graphics on the site looked a bit

424
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,810
dodgy looked a bit cheap looked a bit

425
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,050
low rent maybe I've been fished and he

426
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,880
started doing the sort of things that

427
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,100
you just saw me doing there chopping

428
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,270
pits of URLs and he convinced himself

429
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,480
from doing that because it's day jobs

430
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,040
penetration business he very quickly

431
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,350
convinced himself it was probably okay

432
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,900
and I went back to us what do you think

433
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,420
but eight months later he didn't ten

434
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:29,000
months later he was convicted in court

435
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,220
for unauthorized access there was a jury

436
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,300
trial and there were arguments for and

437
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,320
against but the jury basically accepted

438
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,300
the prosecution's argument that as a

439
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,830
professional computer security expert he

440
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,730
should have known that changing URLs and

441
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,190
fiddling around like he was doing was

442
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,260
not an authorized use of the website

443
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,900
those URLs he was trying to access were

444
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,300
not directly accessible as links

445
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,250
somewhere on the website or published

446
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,350
elsewhere under the control of the

447
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,540
people on the website and therefore he

448
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,180
had made unauthorized access so what you

449
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,490
just saw me doing if that machine was in

450
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,350
the UK which it wasn't that's actually

451
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,340
all running on my machine here if that

452
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,620
was in the UK I may be technically just

453
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,420
committed an offence under the UK

454
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,180
compute misusing and all of your server

455
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,119
farms that are busy doing the same thing

456
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,589
medically done hundreds of thousands of

457
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:32,149
your hours a day they are too so yeah

458
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,309
the you know obviously a more recent

459
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:37,249
case bit more well-known very similar

460
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:40,369
scenario so andrew auernheimer we can

461
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:41,989
say what we like about him as a person

462
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:43,999
or a character and i think he's a

463
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:46,909
douchebag i'll say that publicly but you

464
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:48,649
know what he actually did in this

465
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:50,509
specific instance no matter what else

466
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:54,139
he's done what he simply did was

467
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:56,149
realized that there was a sequential way

468
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:59,869
to access the data on a web server and

469
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:01,849
so he just automated that and did it at

470
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:04,909
scale and so perhaps more because it

471
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:06,259
embarrassed some very powerful people

472
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:08,179
than anything else he ended up being

473
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:10,999
convicted serving 41 months in a federal

474
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:13,219
prison and being fine 73 thousand

475
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:15,289
dollars for basically just looking at

476
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:19,419
various things on a web server so as

477
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:21,799
nick has explained is possible to do all

478
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,389
these things is that a way that we want

479
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:25,699
to proceed ethically we've had this

480
00:21:25,699 --> 00:21:27,409
thing in the industry of you know trying

481
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:29,299
not to do things which we see as being

482
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:33,319
ethically challenging so we tend to shy

483
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,789
away from that that's worked pretty well

484
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:37,009
for us but you know there are also areas

485
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:38,809
where we have probably crossed that line

486
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:40,819
even with automated systems where we're

487
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:42,439
going and downloading things now you can

488
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:44,839
say very easily it's very unlikely that

489
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,639
a criminal is going to try and get a

490
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,909
prosecution against you because of you

491
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,409
know you've done something bad to his

492
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:53,449
malware so however if it's a compromised

493
00:21:53,449 --> 00:21:55,189
server belonging to a legitimate company

494
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,469
and it's been compromised by malware

495
00:21:57,469 --> 00:21:59,479
that company might legitimately go after

496
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:00,739
you as a researcher and say well you

497
00:22:00,739 --> 00:22:01,789
shouldn't have been poking around my

498
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:03,709
server and maybe you caused me to get

499
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:05,419
infected with malware and all those kind

500
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:07,609
of things so it's problematic to say the

501
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:10,699
least and these things are not easy to

502
00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:13,639
to decide but we're kind of blasting

503
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:15,319
through a lot of this much more of it is

504
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:17,989
in the paper we do it really blasting

505
00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:19,279
through this because we want to get to

506
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,739
some of the more kind of the interesting

507
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:22,879
stuff which is the questions that we

508
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:25,429
want to ask you another thing that we've

509
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:27,619
kind of looked at is this is the postal

510
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:29,449
thesis so jon postel was one of the

511
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:32,659
original the RFC editors and he

512
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:34,219
formulated this very simple principle

513
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,019
sometimes called Pascal's law which

514
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:38,149
basically says implementation should be

515
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:40,010
conservative in its sending behavior

516
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,410
a liberal in its receiving behavior and

517
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,900
so it's really basically this kind of

518
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,470
anti engineering thesis which you know

519
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:53,900
don't overdo so you know we should

520
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,560
make make sure that things make sure

521
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,690
that things are actually sound in the

522
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,130
way that they work not just that they

523
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,620
work and if you look at some of the

524
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,900
things that we could have better if we

525
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,640
had done things nicely in there in the

526
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,980
first place we wouldn't have so much fan

527
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,720
because actually strict implementations

528
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,440
of spam smtp as smtp would actually drop

529
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,210
a lot of spam because they're strict

530
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,770
because they don't allow certain

531
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,200
behaviors that spammers use so there's

532
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,360
an example of an antipasto so grey

533
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,610
listing again you know it's dropping a

534
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,320
lot of it because we're not really kind

535
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,910
of very willing to be helpful with

536
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,990
server doesn't really recognize

537
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,630
something it just kind of says yeah no i

538
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:38,240
don't think so so you know there are

539
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,010
ways that if we had done things more

540
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,830
strictly we could have we could have

541
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,050
been better had does anyone else have

542
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,880
some suggestions like what other things

543
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,250
that might have been a good just quickly

544
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,640
well what is if I i'll add them cuz i

545
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,660
wrote papers one would be that would be

546
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,000
pretty cool if we had done you know nice

547
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,890
things with file formats and those file

548
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,600
format did the stuff that those file

549
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,980
farmers are supposed to do so we

550
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,650
actually had you know strict PE format

551
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,150
that doesn't do all these crazy

552
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,100
shenanigans however that would break the

553
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,080
entire world right at this point so we

554
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,320
can't have that PDF should be pdfs not

555
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,750
you know little media players and things

556
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,660
like that so we've got stuff like this

557
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,400
it's good exam on that point there's a

558
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,490
really good there's a paper flange

559
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,840
Albertini which is referenced in our

560
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,390
paper and if you want to see how screwed

561
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,030
up modern computing systems are you

562
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,220
really want to read one that goes yeah

563
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,780
it's a really interesting paper to read

564
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,000
what just how messed up file formats are

565
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,430
so so we have some of these things that

566
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,440
we could have done but we probably can't

567
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,730
get there from here so we're probably

568
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,280
looking for other ways let's bring it

569
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,930
right up to date and Nick if you can get

570
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,750
through this

571
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,130
plaster that's quickly but you probably

572
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,900
hope the you're aware because there's

573
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,330
been quite a lot of news about it the

574
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,040
flash might be in a bit of trouble I

575
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,450
mean it's caused a lot of trouble a

576
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,850
couple of months ago Google who have an

577
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,070
implement their own implementation of

578
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:12,130
flash which is a fixed up version based

579
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,550
on code originally from my dog but they

580
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,980
they work out on web pages like this

581
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,020
which I'm using the example of one of

582
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,760
the news pages they can work out that

583
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,620
that sidebar isn't the main page and

584
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,710
that's the main page and flash objects

585
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,180
that appear on those sidebars and

586
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,520
footers and banner ads and all that

587
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,480
nonsense they won't autoplay them even

588
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,510
if I set to auto play in the HTML that

589
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,020
comes down about a month later Alex

590
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,240
tomas who used to be the CSO at yahoo

591
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,910
and had just moved to facebook on the

592
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,520
same role tweeted that maybe it was time

593
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,590
for adobe to announce an end-of-life

594
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,010
date for flash he's say it would be some

595
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,230
way off but set a date now and everyone

596
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,490
will know when they can actually just

597
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:01,890
kill it for good a couple of days later

598
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,480
firefox turned off every single version

599
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,720
of flesh and the browser because this

600
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,470
was just after the hacking team um

601
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,540
disclosures and there were three I think

602
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,520
it was done and turned out it actually

603
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,960
turned out a couple of days later that I

604
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,580
think there were two more acting team at

605
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,090
then been found at that point there were

606
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,700
30 days flash three days that would

607
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,350
being at least one which was being

608
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,390
actively exploited in the one and others

609
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,670
will quickly added as people work out

610
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:34,330
from handing and then and Facebook's

611
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:37,660
cute tinku quarterly filing for april

612
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,220
jun 2015 which was filed on the

613
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,240
thirtieth of july they added a little

614
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,980
bit of language which was really

615
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,110
interesting i think in this standard

616
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,750
section of this filing risks related to

617
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,260
a business and industry they added or

618
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,920
vulnerabilities wherever they'd

619
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,080
previously only mention software errors

620
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,450
or bugs here is that I've just put the

621
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,070
bits in Riddler that they added but this

622
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,870
is the really interesting but they added

623
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,100
this whole it was actually two

624
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,470
paragraphs I've run it together

625
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:09,120
they added this whole thing so what

626
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,440
they're actually pointing out is that

627
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,330
some of their their core technologies

628
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,010
their social games on Facebook actually

629
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:17,190
rely on on flash and that's actually

630
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,679
response responsible for most of their

631
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,480
payment revenue so you think about that

632
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,580
Facebook is essentially an operating

633
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,370
system and if they can control that

634
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,110
operating system you know you kind of

635
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,730
constraint certain things but their core

636
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,350
technology from which they make nearly

637
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,750
all of their money is based on flash and

638
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,159
yet you know they're certain

639
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,799
vulnerabilities have caused problems for

640
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,559
them and that may well disrupt their

641
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:47,100
ability to provide these games and their

642
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,960
generation of revenue will be hard but

643
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,520
on it's interesting then that Alex on

644
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,870
the other side of that is then saying

645
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,640
well let's turn flash off so we're

646
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,169
wondering how that Facebook's actually

647
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:57,179
going to achieve that if they're making

648
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:58,770
the only way they make you money is from

649
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:02,730
flash amazon amazon advertising gotten

650
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,679
on it as well and has all the first of

651
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:06,720
September they've stopped accepting is

652
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,760
doubling with ads for display on any

653
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,940
amazon properties maybe this is the end

654
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,169
of the flesh what do you think so at

655
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:19,320
this point that's the questions I could

656
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,059
I could answer but I'd like to know from

657
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:22,440
the audience what do you think can we

658
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,120
get rid of flash or not do you think

659
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,129
that's going to work is it gonna happen

660
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:30,750
sorry where were you I didn't see you

661
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:39,600
over there and in particular why granted

662
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:47,150
if turning our flash at the browser is

663
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:50,659
pretty much a hard stop across the board

664
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:53,220
if there is some sort of agreement

665
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,669
obviously anything I say doesn't apply

666
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:59,850
but it does still seem like especially

667
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:03,929
on the borderline and gray parts of the

668
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:08,659
web flash is still very widely used and

669
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:12,150
I think because it's easily deployed

670
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,680
it's going to be probably

671
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,300
2016's too soon I would love to see it

672
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,020
gone tomorrow but I don't see it any

673
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,850
other takers sorry we're going to we're

674
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:29,210
being kicked swiftly up the choice oh

675
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,260
sorry I thought you were doing the time

676
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,150
take loss it's hard to see with advice I

677
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,820
accept totally 12 you to my house had an

678
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:40,380
answer where I my bed ok alright oh so

679
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,690
much must have an idea ok so so I don't

680
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,120
think it's going to happen or I think it

681
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,400
might happen but if it happens we might

682
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,740
find ourselves in the worst of possible

683
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,230
worlds whereby people will have to

684
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:55,020
revert for their own internet use to old

685
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,850
versions of browsers that don't get

686
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:59,070
updated old flash versions that don't

687
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,770
get upgraded so this sort of dank game

688
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,890
changer well it sounds great I mean I'd

689
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,660
love to get rid of flash might totally

690
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,610
backfire on us yeah that's what I would

691
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,990
do my answer there's a lot of unintended

692
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,880
consequences with all of these things

693
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,770
and there's a lot of economic factors

694
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,870
that drive it and I think one of the

695
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:19,200
things that we are we are constantly up

696
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,840
against is that there are lots and lots

697
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,030
of attacks and lots of attack services

698
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,670
and those keep moving and attackers like

699
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,610
very vulnerable staff and so we might

700
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:33,150
finally secure pcs we might finally get

701
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,120
nice encryption on our networks but will

702
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,620
we be able to secure all the Android

703
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,090
devices out there that no one's got an

704
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:42,450
economic incentive to update and will we

705
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,330
be able to fix the internet of terrible

706
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:49,050
things who knows we got ya so one prod I

707
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,410
would love for it to be killed but one

708
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,450
problem is for instance if i look at my

709
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,790
own son in school all the educational

710
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,730
software is flesh we are still seeing

711
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,190
internet explorer 6 in companies in

712
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,480
corporate simply because they have

713
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,610
applications that require functionality

714
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,960
which is already there in internet

715
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,560
explorer 6 i wish it would go but i'm

716
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,860
afraid that without globally killing it

717
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:19,920
it will stay yeah does anyone else have

718
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,500
any questions all citizens were out of

719
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,570
tonight ok so that's a one very very

720
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,760
very very very fun thing we haven't

721
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,930
finished this conversation this paper

722
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:28,710

723
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,450

recorder thingy that he's willing to

726
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,309
stick in your face so you can record

727
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:37,020
