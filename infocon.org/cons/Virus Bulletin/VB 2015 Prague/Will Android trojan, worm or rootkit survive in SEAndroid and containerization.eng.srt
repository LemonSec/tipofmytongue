1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,340
well ladies and gentlemen it's my

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,929
pleasure to be other introduce william

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,620
lee and Roland you from Sophos who I can

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,630
discuss the challenge will Android

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,910
Trojans worms or rickets survive in SE a

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,309
android and I've got 50 bucks riding on

7
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,710
yes so gentlemen let's see if my money's

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,199
good thank you I've no doubt that this

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,810
is my corner William based in Australia

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,480
so over the last few years as Android

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,730
and the counter ization has become the

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,729
buzzy word in the mobile security so we

13
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,880
choose them as our topic because a mango

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,520
of both is trying to minimize the damage

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,210
of the malicious applications intruders

16
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,850
and the vulnerabilities so attempt to

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,980
expand the fundamental information or

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,340
for them and their impacts so moreover

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,309
we will choose some weekly is that even

20
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,430
with this security enhancement the

21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,280
device can be still infected still have

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,800
data stolen and experience the

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,400
exploration of vulnerabilities so we

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,220
will demonstrate their failures by using

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,070
some popular examples and we will talk

26
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,189
about some evolution of threat in the

27
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,060
near future before the conclusion so why

28
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,900
as he enjoyed an account realization so

29
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,180
first of all give a quick summary of

30
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,380
them which is a access can chew so se

31
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,259
Android was released in version 2 4.3 in

32
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,659
2013 and merging into main line in

33
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,630
version 5 so it back it provided access

34
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,079
control to application data resources

35
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,500
and system services so can transition

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,909
was introduced by security vendors to be

37
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,430
a component of mobile device management

38
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,630
it attempts to control the access to

39
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,310
enterprise data so a lot of customers

40
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,290
medias and price including Google itself

41
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,739
believe that after adoption the off of

42
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,800
se Android and contrary

43
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,240
you can significantly reduce damage of

44
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,290
malicious software protect users from

45
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,710
potential flaws or vulnerabilities so is

46
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,730
it a two let's take look some statistics

47
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,820
so after Sen geode was released in 2013

48
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,650
13 July today we have over sixty percent

49
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,300
device learning with Sen Jordan a border

50
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,120
however suppose Whitney is an increase

51
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,980
of pose ser engine oil and pool so for

52
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,190
example in July's 2013 we have recorded

53
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,780
near 400 k more we're in total after one

54
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,960
year the total number become 1 million

55
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,480
soto months later will receive another 1

56
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,880
million new more way of samples so at

57
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,090
that time sng old has released for over

58
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,020
two years now I'm going to pass the next

59
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:18,980
part to my colleague William let me give

60
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,019
you a quick overview / se Android

61
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,230
Android is basically Linux operating

62
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,200
system it comes with discretionary

63
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,680
access control by default each

64
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,330
application in your device has its own

65
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:41,330
user ID n group ID for isolation for

66
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:46,820
example this is system application has a

67
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,190
system frivolity so it has the system

68
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,450
you ID and group ID however so the party

69
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,270
browser application has does not deploy

70
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,420
any system privileges so it has a normal

71
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,770
you ID and group ID in addition to that

72
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,140
Android operating system introduced app

73
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,530
permissions such as send SMS or internet

74
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,920
connection only Kroenke the permissions

75
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,620
are loaded with tech an app permissions

76
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,728
Android platform looks very secure

77
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,800
however tech mechanism has its own

78
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,240
weaknesses for

79
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,789
there is no system why the security

80
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:31,460
policy but it has to lie on the pile

81
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,120
owner the discretion several problems

82
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,789
has been reported for example the old

83
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:40,009
version of skype application created as

84
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:43,330
several files on the apps folder

85
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,419
provides include several sensitive

86
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:48,889
information but the file was created

87
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,530
with leader a world leader writable

88
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,160
accessor all the third party application

89
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,069
was able to access the file second float

90
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:01,210
or malicious application can fight ask

91
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,949
permission system and they can escalate

92
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:07,069
their privileges so it's just on the map

93
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:10,130
that there is no way to combine system

94
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,909
Givens or send you ID programs that runs

95
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:17,990
with through the permission to tackle

96
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,909
the doors problem mandatory access

97
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:22,270
control mechanism has been introduced

98
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,789
there is a system-wide security policy

99
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:28,940
and subjects such as the application

100
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,770
process is it will be labeled with

101
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,210
domain names and subject including file

102
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,789
system or system resources it will be

103
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:43,120
labeled with cross names for example

104
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,280
when you drawn PS commander with my Nazi

105
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,389
option in SD Android system we can see

106
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,120
the system security context information

107
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,560
as long as with learning processes for

108
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,400
example setting application has system

109
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,710
uid also it is labeled with system app

110
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,199
domain name the soda party browser

111
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,460
application has a user ID but it is

112
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,800
labeled with untrusted so the party of

113
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,599
location domain name this prolific

114
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:24,440
particular security policy has followed

115
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,719
certain format for example action

116
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,919
subject and object and permission for

117
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,969
example this one AB domain which also

118
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:36,800
include the untruths the soda party

119
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,380
application

120
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,370
can access system folder but only for

121
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:48,700
readability access permission the

122
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,830
following diagram shows the same

123
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,170
architects of sa Android it has a city

124
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,810
component corner space user space and

125
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,700
the security policy computers invite

126
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,950
security sober in corner space loader

127
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,980
security policy information and cook

128
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,250
every single system core and make a

129
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,440
decision and this decision will be

130
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,590
cached also system servers in userspace

131
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,700
likely in it why install d also use the

132
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,820
same policy information for example when

133
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,420
you install your application the insert

134
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,180
d will check all the security policy and

135
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,610
that the new application files will be

136
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,490
labeled with new context information

137
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,120
also when you start in your application

138
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,120
so I could keep process will poke and

139
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,800
execute the new process and the new

140
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,380
process will be labeled with new context

141
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:52,930
information Android also introduced

142
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,510
middleware Mac mechanism poll app

143
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:02,650
permissions for example what we can do

144
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,680
is the system application which is

145
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,320
signed with the system certificate we

146
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,720
can allow everything every permissions

147
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,690
however we can deny certain permissions

148
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,420
for so the party application although

149
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,370
endo Health this mechanism but Android

150
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,800
4.5 does not have any restriction on the

151
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,500
soda party applications so as long as

152
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,810
the application permissions are granted

153
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,750
by the user vendor application installed

154
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:39,460
all permissions are allowed it se

155
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,279
Android is not able to

156
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:45,310
techart order security problems however

157
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,600
as the Android con can be a good

158
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,199
solution for root exploit for example in

159
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,550
the break it is one of the well-known

160
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,430
Android booties destroyed it exploit

161
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,999
system vulnerability and install hidden

162
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,870
payload inside bodoni system partition

163
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,110
but this family cannot survive with LC

164
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,720
Android because we have a certain

165
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,110
security policy for example this one

166
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,439
this secret policy does not allow saw

167
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:25,209
the party appdomain applications to hold

168
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:28,290
read access for the system folder

169
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,430
another example rage against kg here's

170
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,759
another do to exploit but this family

171
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,300
cannot survive either because there's a

172
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:46,379
one specific security policy abdo main

173
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:49,389
applications is not allowed you to

174
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:52,120
change it from so the party normal

175
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,860
application for ability to system

176
00:09:53,860 --> 00:10:00,399
privileges ok then let's talk about the

177
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,649
second topic containerisation

178
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:08,379
containerization was interest by

179
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:11,559
security vendors at the MDM solution so

180
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:14,259
you can use your personal device for

181
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:17,879
enterprise application

182
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,239
for example enterprise data including

183
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:32,410
business email contact wall internet

184
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,989
browser information will be stored in

185
00:10:34,989 --> 00:10:39,759
separate isolated encrypt container only

186
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,699
certified application can access those

187
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:44,949
information inside a secure container

188
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:48,689
but not from the solar party application

189
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:52,179
but container edges technology also

190
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:56,079
health is a limitation because you can

191
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,790
install the application like your

192
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,790
favorite games or Facebook or Twitter

193
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,209
inside the secure container so it has

194
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:09,160
also limitation Android introduces many

195
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,959
secure a security enhancement like

196
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,170
selinux or container Isis technology but

197
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,049
they conserve all the problems my

198
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:22,689
colleague Roland will talk about those

199
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:32,769
problems pay wise Z's security

200
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:37,360
enhancement doomed to fail permissions

201
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,529
are the key to control access in android

202
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:44,079
however those enhancements didn't touch

203
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,379
it no matter which platform social

204
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:49,480
engineering is most successful attack

205
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,679
technicals and Sen droid trying to

206
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,850
minimize damage of all abilities however

207
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,860
7recent availability are able to bypass

208
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,489
it capability in contradiction is

209
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,160
another block another big problem that

210
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,730
may broke other functionalities there

211
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,100
are many device running with older

212
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,110
versions like 4.3 4.4 from no orono OEMs

213
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,769
or customized loom distributors this

214
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:23,499
gives excellent environment for more

215
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:26,860
well to survive so we are the most trade

216
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,490
above factors in the foreign parts these

217
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,660
are figures this figure shows the

218
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,889
classification of 1 million

219
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,350
unique more well received by suppose in

220
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,529
the last 12 months so premium SMS nom

221
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:44,499
SMS sender is the largest mobile family

222
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:47,859
and the O's over fifty percent more way

223
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:49,359
of choosing hosts the second position

224
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:53,049
followed by the spyware welcome and the

225
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:55,899
rest of them are good kid ransomware

226
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:59,139
fake AV we are going to chill houses

227
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:01,480
more where families can survive in the

228
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,790
security enhancement so SMS sender Choji

229
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,459
is largest us read because this is the

230
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:12,429
easiest way for criminals to make fast

231
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:15,189
money so the easiness can be divided

232
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:19,179
into two ways it requires only one

233
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:23,379
permission send SMS and use send text

234
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:26,519
messages to silently send SMS and

235
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,259
usually take advantage of social

236
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:32,499
engineering to be fake games fake

237
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:36,999
application or porn video players let's

238
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:39,669
create take a quick demo for sure how

239
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:42,579
standards mask active catch if under the

240
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:45,040
enhancement of C enjoyed and can

241
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,319
transition so as you can see this phone

242
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:54,489
is along with Angelo washing 5.11 and I

243
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:58,929
develop a simple application to send SMS

244
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:02,139
and I will going standard this message

245
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:05,649
to my colleague Williams phone maybe

246
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:09,549
it's too small to shoe but it works yeah

247
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:15,989
I gotta miss so quite simple

248
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:24,709
so engine back door is the one of the

249
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:27,889
most complicated family and you will

250
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:30,319
perform multiple tasker see in the list

251
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:33,679
so the more we all writers use a variety

252
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,230
of methods and technicals to ease their

253
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,049
applications it's very hard to measure

254
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:42,049
the effectiveness of se Android and the

255
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,660
containerization you know just enjoy the

256
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:49,220
back doors so if se Android enabled so

257
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,410
normal back doors have troubled to

258
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,049
carrying out install itself into system

259
00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:56,929
to actually remove system applications

260
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:00,110
or you know access as application

261
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,319
starter but is still able to uploading

262
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,480
sensitive information download and

263
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,389
install occasions so we have another

264
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:13,119
demo to show get the contact information

265
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:21,889
for my phone yeah okay so if I click

266
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:24,920
this one you will see to list all the

267
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:30,649
contact information for the phone so

268
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:34,670
however back doors can be hidden in loom

269
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:38,509
image by either legitimate OEMs or so

270
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:41,720
the party distributors so as a result

271
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,110
this kind of pact or has a superuser

272
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,209
privileges and they can accomplish any

273
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:49,879
task loss without worrying about se

274
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:52,970
Android this mobile cool rape is

275
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,549
developed by one of the biggest Chinese

276
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:59,240
OEM cool pad and the disability in

277
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,790
several model so it can accomplish most

278
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,990
of task us in the previous slides the

279
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,949
function in the spyware and Bank

280
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:12,589
children can be found in x factor too

281
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:15,470
but they have specific target so they

282
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,319
use social engineering together

283
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:21,290
sensitive information like about person

284
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,769
organization or devices and the

285
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:28,160
disinformation can be SMS lock location

286
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,380
login and password details

287
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,260
well this sump this is not first time we

288
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,560
found the angel more in google play

289
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,750
however this spyware invested by surface

290
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,180
is a much more complicated than before

291
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,840
so first of all this mobile attempts to

292
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,500
harvest facebook account secondary it is

293
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,410
more will take the magnitude of social

294
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,400
engineering to be as a popular game and

295
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,730
attracted a 500k 21 million installs in

296
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,610
google play moreover you to utilize a

297
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:07,230
framework named the mono game to

298
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,589
creating cross-platform applications

299
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:13,710
which means the same malicious code can

300
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:18,420
be published in iOS Mac OS Linux windows

301
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:24,000
even playstation 4 and it makes reverse

302
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,250
it engineering very difficult because

303
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,780
its load cold dynamically from website

304
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:36,630
so it also claimed only few permissions

305
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:41,640
to make them less suspicious fake AV and

306
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,330
ransomware report fake a lot to scare

307
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,900
victims to pay money it has to scale

308
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,470
functions so the first one is to lock up

309
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,280
device with pop up that frees out or

310
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,700
other applications so it needs either

311
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,150
wake up or system alert window

312
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,150
permission the second one is trying to

313
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,260
encrypt the documents pictures audios

314
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,980
videos and it needs red and the right

315
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,280
external storage permission so this

316
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,280
example you can generate a floating

317
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,340
window as a pop-up by setting specific

318
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,170
of flatus and it use a system alert

319
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,440
window permission so the next one I'm

320
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,620
going to show you is the simple lock

321
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,990
then somewhere it use the wake up wake

322
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,330
lock permission and it can survive you

323
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,190
and your se Android and contrary

324
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,960
she and caused the damage due to

325
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,090
personal information so make it

326
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:54,610
beautiful for it as you can see this why

327
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:59,379
is watching maybe it's just too small

328
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:09,419
Mick mix one better sorry replayed so

329
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:13,090
you can see it's open a PDF file so

330
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:19,360
false report and I started this run

331
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,969
somewhere it's a Russian ET rushing and

332
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:30,669
I'm trying to open setting now it's pop

333
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:40,139
up as application doesn't work so

334
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:53,350
sorry another video and if I want to try

335
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,560
to open this PDF file again it give me

336
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,100
arrow because that PDF I has been

337
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:06,940
equipped by simple lock so as a result

338
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,460
we can see that the resin where maybe

339
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,420
may not access the sensitive information

340
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,540
in the security secure container but the

341
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,270
behavior of lockout and the encryption

342
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,730
will seriously this decrease the

343
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,930
usability of your device and you can get

344
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,080
cannot you can only be removed by

345
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,390
rebooting shift mode or performing a

346
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,900
factory set so the bottle page you have

347
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,330
to be discussed the case by case here at

348
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,000
least two popular one the first one is

349
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,340
the Samsung pre-installed the swiftkey

350
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,320
risk the over 600 million device

351
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,260
affected by this significant risk

352
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,350
including the galaxy s6 so this risk has

353
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,710
two issues first it's rely on HTTP to

354
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,750
upload updating language file which

355
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,750
allow many middle attack to modify the

356
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,330
language file second one this

357
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,960
pre-installed keyboard allow attack to

358
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,890
execute code remotely as a system user

359
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,070
so if once this flow is explored so the

360
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,880
attack can remotely install vacations

361
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,860
evil chopping incoming outcome messages

362
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,310
still sensitive data so finally the

363
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,800
attacker content is legitimate vacation

364
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,910
to actual key lock spyware therefore it

365
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,370
can break pose as the Android and the

366
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,760
counter-revolution so this year the most

367
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,120
famous vulnerability stage fright so it

368
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,840
affect version is from 2 to 10 to 25

369
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,390
point while the speed flight is not only

370
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,090
for paying media media files but also

371
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,880
generate some nails and exchequer

372
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,960
metadata from media files so attacks can

373
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,750
stand smm

374
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,470
mass or webpage that content customize

375
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,600
the mediafire to check this variability

376
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,070
or it can be triggered by when the user

377
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,740
view the sub nails including the

378
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,460
malicious mms so again the stage fright

379
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,410
has system privilege to so this table

380
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:23,040
concluding by josh buying black hat 2015

381
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,130
from his research we can see the sen

382
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,580
jawed cannot mitigate stage fright the

383
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:34,410
only challenger is Elsa so in the real

384
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,160
world the number of fruity device is a

385
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,590
great there our expectation so a study

386
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,500
shows that twenty-five percent mobile

387
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,310
users looted easier device in China the

388
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,290
benefit of looting device it can be

389
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,510
installed Lutie application booster

390
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,840
phones or battery life or you can we

391
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,600
remove pre-installed software so as a

392
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,210
result it comes no surprise that

393
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,910
malicious good kit is being so popular

394
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,810
and boot kit like oh the board can

395
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:10,800
infect us hundred thousand devices in

396
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,390
the future so in factor now of security

397
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,270
announcement adjust the coin issue are

398
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,360
related to enter the permission model so

399
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,400
as a result google introduced a new

400
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,860
permission model in android app version

401
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,480
6 that allow user to choose what

402
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,340
permission are you application can

403
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,550
access at a long time but we believe in

404
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,190
the next two months the uprising Chad

405
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,140
will continue dominate and your mobile

406
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,370
attack and the angel mobile getting

407
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,620
smarter and aiming to generate more

408
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,350
profit and they will continue using the

409
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,030
social engineering and enjoy the

410
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:58,980
fragmentation in conclusion I will talk

411
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,250
more about angel m attack vectors the

412
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,160
vehicle and variable based mobile so

413
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,940
Angela M poor old idea from apple with

414
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,460
angel m permissions will be

415
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,059
grouped to make a review easier and user

416
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,789
has ability to view and add it to the

417
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,760
given permission for applications so

418
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,480
however the plication d'application can

419
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,720
still use the permission model and there

420
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,960
is no reviews in Google Play and third

421
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,990
party stores like Apple and Android the

422
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,440
fragmentation is another big problem and

423
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,779
we will see more attack vectors like

424
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:42,539
Google Play Store so the party store

425
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:46,080
rooms from either legit or third-party

426
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,669
disturber distributors spare mms and the

427
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:53,610
internet and we believe internet will be

428
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,679
the next big threat and we are going to

429
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,080
whitney's there is a real possibility

430
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,600
that vehicle at the variable based

431
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,480
mobile in the future especially

432
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,799
ransomware so we proved that simple lock

433
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,970
ransomware has a has has infected can be

434
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:19,970
infected a smartphone and linked

435
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:25,350
smartwatch and because thatís variables

436
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,159
at the phone as I mean to sync Sims

437
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,620
simplicity and the smoothly any update

438
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,120
will be pushed to both device so we

439
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,419
believe this kind of attack will be a

440
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:42,659
appears in the next two years so

441
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:46,020
questions also so that we have plenty of

442
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,480
time for questions so if you can give me

443
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:56,390
a way of so I have a question yeah

444
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,470
obviously you said it was doomed to fail

445
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,890
I think you're probably right how much

446
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,299
do you think the changes in EM will

447
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:04,950
really impact this because the social

448
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,570
engineering aspects won't change and

449
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,220
then the second part of the question is

450
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,960
what would you have done if you were in

451
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,000
charge of the program to make it better

452
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,110
ah you mean that how we can make develop

453
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,529
applications to make the batter or well

454
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:21,929
what the Android developers themselves

455
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:23,190
might have done that would have

456
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,059
addressed the issues that you saw

457
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:29,769
uh-huh I think it is it this is very

458
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:32,440
difficult one for more for the answer

459
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,669
cosa in the in the real world because we

460
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:39,429
have seen a lot of fragmentation is how

461
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:42,820
to control at this side so for example

462
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,519
in the in the goo in Google Play I think

463
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:47,320
it's getting better by the way still can

464
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,779
see a lot of more will kanpai past

465
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:53,289
google policy and they will getting more

466
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:57,639
smart 2222 infected the people's so for

467
00:26:57,639 --> 00:26:59,559
example in the Z we are using the

468
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:04,470
dynamic loading to to load the data and

469
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:07,659
in that way we will have no have a small

470
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,789
child never have little chance to

471
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:13,179
witness order odd code because they

472
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:15,519
don't really know human no human written

473
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:17,769
is this kind of behavior and other

474
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,049
things like they will using the IP

475
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:22,720
address checking to bypass the Google

476
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,379
bouncing verification because they check

477
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:29,889
the google pages for the dynamic for the

478
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:32,830
new kind of simulation so without human

479
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,929
verification it's really hard for their

480
00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:39,490
yeah and any questions from the floor we

481
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:43,840
still have to say this major time there

482
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,820
being none i think what remains her to

483
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,830
thank our excellent two speakers Roland

484
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,189
