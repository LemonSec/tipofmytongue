1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,590
alright thanks for joining us back in

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,019
the green room next up we have christy

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,670
chung with for Donna she's going to

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,160
present the evolution of ransomware from

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,310
Krypto wall to CTB locker take it away

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,830
Christie okay so good afternoon everyone

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,939
is so nice to person here yeah my topic

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,680
today is evolution of rain somewhere

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:35,010
from Krypto war to CTB locker in recent

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,380
years many different kinds of ransomware

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,739
have begun to spring up rapidly

12
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,329
ransomware is a type of malware that

13
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,700
encrypts targeted files with different

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,829
and Christian methods and requires

15
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,660
arrange them to decrypt them so that

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,480
they can be assessed again from

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,719
cryptolocker to CDP Locker the

18
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,550
encryption method are becoming more and

19
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,039
more complicated payment schemes are

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,379
also changing from real currency to your

21
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,700
bitcoins communications methods have

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,970
also become more and more intricate

23
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,030
cryptolocker used a DGA to generate a

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,470
list of C&C server crypto war uses the

25
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,290
rc4 algorithm to encrypt all the

26
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,950
communication between C&C server and

27
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,360
requires payment through the Tor network

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,270
CTB locker is short for curve tour

29
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,079
Bitcoin locker which is the the first

30
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,890
word stands for a lip achill curve which

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,619
is encryption algorithm tease Denver

32
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,560
tour it which is the communication

33
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,030
protocol and bitcoins East arrange them

34
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,340
currency in this presentation will look

35
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,899
at two of the currently most where

36
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,140
crypto war and also CTB Locker through

37
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,290
their communication methods the way they

38
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,040
select target files and encryption

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:10,080
methods crypto war first collect victims

40
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,629
computer information such as computer

41
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,350
name

42
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,150
system drive processor identifier

43
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,120
processor level and process revision the

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,350
under 50 hash from all of this computer

45
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,650
information which is used as an event

46
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,200
object name to indicate whether the

47
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,180
malware has already been running on the

48
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,140
computer if the hash is not found means

49
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,150
that is not running have it has not been

50
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,370
running a computer it will create a new

51
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,650
process explorer explorer process and it

52
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,410
jet in itself into it and then they

53
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,100
create svchost process under the

54
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,340
explorer process and it jack itself its

55
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,280
payload into it all the communication

56
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,580
wanting plans and encryption happens

57
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:09,000
within de as we see hoes as you can see

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,290
the figure here the malware creates

59
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:17,070
svchost under the exploring process and

60
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,460
it jet is pelo into it crew to what

61
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,050
creates another threat inside the

62
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,950
svchost which is responsible for

63
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,380
contacting the C&C server and for the

64
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,630
encryption process the motor generates a

65
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,100
pseudo random string with the

66
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,700
variable-length key first using their KS

67
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,780
a to initiate initialize the string and

68
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,140
then using the PRT a to output a secret

69
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,660
key that encrypts the victims computer

70
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,270
information and sends it to the

71
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,840
hard-coded C&C server every compromised

72
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,750
computer has its own unique I'll see for

73
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,020
key I make a screenshot here which is

74
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,970
unique for the sample data analysis the

75
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,820
malware also used the camping ID to

76
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,590
track the spreading methods of the

77
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,590
sample for example December when Alice

78
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,950
has the IDC w44 which indicates that the

79
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,769
sample was bred by Cal well the idea

80
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,530
along with the md5 hash of the computer

81
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,120
information that was generated earlier

82
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,880
and a unit rc4 key

83
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,250
be used for the post request to the CNC

84
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,310
server to indicate does infection status

85
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:38,100
of the computer the communication

86
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,470
between malware and the C&C server are

87
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,640
encrypted with RC for the server runs

88
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,410
and encrypt a message containing I mean

89
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,310
the server returns and encrypted message

90
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,950
containing the onion address of the

91
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,830
attackers website a user ID for the

92
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,010
victim country code public key that is

93
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,650
used to encrypt their victims file using

94
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:10,980
RSA 2048 as you can see from the

95
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,370
screenshot crypto war receive a user ID

96
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,850
from victim which this first one and

97
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,240
Static onions addresses for payment of

98
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,520
ransoms and the victims country code

99
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,450
because I analysis in Canada so is ca it

100
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,140
done the malware generate crc32 hash for

101
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,630
the victims country code and compares it

102
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,230
against a list of specific country code

103
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,260
as you can see in the bottom be y bella

104
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,700
girls ua oakland russia and cussin if

105
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,270
the victims country code matches one of

106
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,670
the codes the malware will proceed to

107
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,210
remove all the drop files and registry

108
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:58,640
entries that he has created just stop

109
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,230
otherwise it would starts to import that

110
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,990
RSA key and encrypt the victims files

111
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,340
the screenshot here shows that the

112
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,130
decrypted public key is in a PM format

113
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,130
which you will be used for the RSA 2048

114
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,500
encryption for all that targeted files

115
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,410
and folders after finishing preparing

116
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,500
the onion URLs the malware preparing the

117
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,210
decrypted instructions in three

118
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:32,640
different types like formats HTML txt

119
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,130
and a URL that the Christian instruction

120
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,169
teaches how to

121
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,810
sorry the decryption instruction teach

122
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,240
victim how to pay the Rings them after

123
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,250
the targeted files and folders have been

124
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:56,240
encrypted now let's talk about the CDP

125
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,550
Locker City be locker in jet itself into

126
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,850
two processes one is the svchost and the

127
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,980
export process as VC holes I responsible

128
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,220
for the file encryption and Explorer

129
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,980
process responsible for contacting the

130
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,490
C&C server display a warning that the

131
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,900
Christian of the fire according to the

132
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,030
server responses the reason for making

133
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,640
two separate processes that if even if

134
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,570
the user kills the warning process the

135
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,670
encryption process will still be active

136
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,880
and if the user restore the files while

137
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,190
the encryption process is active the

138
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:42,860
files will be encrypted again now let's

139
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,750
talk about the communication method of

140
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,070
the CTB Locker the C&C server list is

141
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,340
static in a malware lot by binary they

142
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,830
are onion domains this makes it harder

143
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,470
to trace the origin of the C&C server

144
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,980
location the malware Lang statically to

145
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,020
the tour library for the tour procedures

146
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,870
as you can see the form a screenshot the

147
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,490
malware is trying to contact a

148
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:14,810
hard-coded onion URL for City be locker

149
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,510
the communication used tor an ssl

150
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,660
protocols the message body is encrypted

151
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,070
using the aes and the ec th e zg is used

152
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,620
to generate the aes key which i call it

153
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,809
stash and key the mower sends the

154
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:34,700
generated client public key to the

155
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,340
server to initiate the communication and

156
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,880
the return receive an XML format file in

157
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,520
the file it will contains the address of

158
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,100
the Bitcoin wallet the price in bitcoins

159
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,020
as well as surprising currency of the

160
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,829
local machine

161
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,570
as you can see from the screenshot it

162
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,460
shows the process of passing the key

163
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,500
which is that the christian p and

164
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,350
arranged them is in USD return from the

165
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:08,700
server comparing to CTB locker crypto

166
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,590
war requires more victims unit

167
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,750
information during the CNC server

168
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,710
communication for example user ID

169
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,060
computer information including volume

170
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,430
serial number processor model and

171
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,000
computer name for city bellaca uses tour

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,470
as its client-server communication

173
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,470
protocol newer versions may come with

174
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,250
the updated service list server list in

175
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,710
order to avoid future C&C server being

176
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,700
sing ho or blocked for both crypto war

177
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,310
and CD be Locker have chosen to store

178
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,340
hard hard coded C&C server across the

179
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,070
URL in the binary instead of choosing

180
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:53,250
DGA or added dynamic techniques in this

181
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,770
slide I will talk about how cute awards

182
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,890
to latest select files it looks for

183
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,860
special folders to maintain the infected

184
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,490
computers normal operations as you can

185
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,580
see from the slide actually skip this

186
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,420
for like the windows folder program

187
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,100
files folder time folder if it also

188
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,390
start looking scans order mounted drives

189
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,450
except the cd-rom drives after looking

190
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,180
for special files folders the malware

191
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,010
start to looking for special files to

192
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,370
encrypt it first few to all files based

193
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,950
on file name and then filter out based

194
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,360
on the extension name file name is hash

195
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,080
into crc32 which will be used compared

196
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,450
against a hash list the hash list

197
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,910
includes all the files which should not

198
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,490
be encrypted during the analysis we

199
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,380
found that the target of our most

200
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,890
document files traffic files source

201
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,660
files and video or audio files

202
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,269
once that targeted files are found they

203
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:06,209
be encrypted with the RSA using the wind

204
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:08,519
crypt library with the public key that

205
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,189
is I was received from the CNC server as

206
00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:13,499
you can see from the screenshot the

207
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:16,110
malware creates a full path of the

208
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,990
encrypted file to the Machine user

209
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:24,059
registry key this is the encrypted file

210
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:29,779
structure the first 40 word is the magic

211
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:32,399
they had a magic which is chosen

212
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,519
randomly from one of the four static

213
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,069
magic they were in the bottom that the

214
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:39,869
header structure you can see four

215
00:11:39,869 --> 00:11:44,160
different d words it's like wrinkly and

216
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,240
the next D word is the crc32 hash of the

217
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,759
volume serial number of the computer the

218
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:53,069
following two D word are the original

219
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:55,139
file size before it was encrypted and

220
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:58,410
encrypted file size it saves the

221
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,980
original five sets of our size and an

222
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,449
encrypted file size into the header for

223
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:08,579
later the Christian Post purposes after

224
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,170
finishing and Christian if saves to

225
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,550
encrypt the file with the random

226
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,120
expansion appending to the oral original

227
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,230
preserving the origin of our information

228
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,379
and then delete the original file in

229
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:22,439
addition to equipping files the model is

230
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:25,499
the volumes shadow copies and disabled

231
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:28,350
and window error recovery screens and

232
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,300
stuff up in order to increase the

233
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,809
difficulty of recovering files the mower

234
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:36,029
also attempts to disable the following

235
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:39,360
like six different surfaces in order to

236
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,050
reduce the computers security level

237
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,970
furthermore the malware disabled window

238
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,889
updates and error reporting in order to

239
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:52,279
avoid detection for the sitibi locker

240
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:57,299
encryption process in svchost process

241
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:00,209
starts if the process explorer process

242
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:03,179
can successfully contact a C&C server it

243
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:05,610
then gets the current window serial

244
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,220
number from the following registry and

245
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,810
hash into the sha-256

246
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,839
this key is used to encrypt and decrypt

247
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,260
the local configuration file the

248
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,660
encryption algorithm is one to a bit aes

249
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:29,740
I just mentioned in the previous life

250
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,170
about a configuration file the local

251
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,510
configuration file is saved in this up

252
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,670
data and then with the random file name

253
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,150
which will contain a flag indicating

254
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,790
whether the system is already infected a

255
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,880
fresh for decryption I hold the

256
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,430
structure for cherkis for a decryption

257
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,330
for the five demo five files and a

258
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,250
holder structure for the service private

259
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,670
key I see a C&C server communication

260
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,600
shaky a C&C server onion URL the holder

261
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,930
structures are initially empty there are

262
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,529
threats that checks the flex and holders

263
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:10,240
periodically in these cases 1000

264
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,210
milliseconds during our analysis we

265
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,900
found that the target files are most

266
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:24,730
text file photo data storage files 32

267
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,130
threads are created in the svchost

268
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,830
process one is responsible for

269
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,110
encrypting all the targeted files and

270
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,420
the other one is responsible for

271
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,760
dropping the help files in the same

272
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,120
folder as the targeted file if the help

273
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,790
is file in the helpers file it tells the

274
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,220
victim that the files are encrypted and

275
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,320
demanding a ransom for that encryption

276
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,200
it also claims that the malware is using

277
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,350
the strongest encryption and unit key

278
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,300
generated from this computer it provides

279
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,370
instructions about how to pay the ransom

280
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,120
like assessing then onion URL copying

281
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,339
pasting certain public key to decide in

282
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:09,820
paying bitcoins to insert an address for

283
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,390
the encryption procedure a first skip

284
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,480
the system / tactic file and the files

285
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,230
that are being used and that moves the

286
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,560
target file to a time folder or the

287
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,090
current folder under the name

288
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,600
it is a random string dot TMP the file

289
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,270
creation time is set to the original and

290
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,690
then attend an extension to it this

291
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,480
extension is very useful and because is

292
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,600
used as a marker for the malware to find

293
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,060
and then decrypt that the file if is

294
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,940
needed the file is moved back to the

295
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,590
original file a location and the file is

296
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,750
affected using satin lip and then

297
00:15:53,750 --> 00:16:00,620
encrypted using the aes for a ctp locker

298
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,830
the key for aes encryption is calculated

299
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,450
using easy th and u uses the constant

300
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,910
base point 9 followed by all zeros to

301
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:15,620
general generate a client's papa ki the

302
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,490
aes key I call it shaky behaves like a

303
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,910
session key and is generated using the

304
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,070
server's public key and the clients

305
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:28,280
private key the class public-private

306
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,710
keep hair is generated randomly for each

307
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:35,960
file after each encryption the shaky is

308
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,210
this guard and only the generated

309
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,720
clients property is saving to the header

310
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,210
it uses the server's private key to

311
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,520
regenerate this Jackie for the fire

312
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,000
encryption Ellen pana 30 bite-size

313
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,870
header to the encrypted file in this

314
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,470
slide I showed the structure of the

315
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,410
header I mean structure for the

316
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,840
encrypted file in the header the first

317
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,209
20 bytes are the clients public key and

318
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,140
the next ten bites at the file info from

319
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,140
the second like the bottom graph the

320
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,890
structure looks like the info structure

321
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,530
looks like the first D word is the magic

322
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,119
and the next to D were at the original

323
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,569
file size and a modified file size and

324
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:27,619
the last D word is the flag it is always

325
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:31,250
one for none demo files it means that if

326
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,850
we run it will become exactly zero the

327
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,670
fire info structure is also and created

328
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,540
using

329
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:43,070
the aes with the same Sharky for the

330
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,140
gooey process it creates a threat that

331
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,210
keeps reading the local configuration

332
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,120
file avid 1000 milliseconds that the

333
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,330
Christian fly is that once the private

334
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,970
key is received once the flag is that

335
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,060
the great process started decryption as

336
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,580
I have already described it requires the

337
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,370
share key for AE as description at

338
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:08,150
decryption in order to obtain the shaky

339
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,430
it needs the clients property which is

340
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,150
stored in encrypted file header and also

341
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:18,950
it needs their service product key city

342
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,830
be locker provides a demo decryption of

343
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:26,590
five files for Victor the demo can work

344
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,960
offline without contacting the CNC

345
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,780
server which may give the false hope to

346
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,170
the victim that the other files can also

347
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,750
be decrypted with dollar service private

348
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,420
key in fact the five shakeys were saved

349
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:47,300
in the local config files earlier here

350
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,550
comes to the conclusion when we compare

351
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,390
a crypto warren CDP locker the

352
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,060
encryption algorithm is different crypto

353
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,870
war used at RSA 2048 and CTB lock I use

354
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,860
them 128-bit AES they both target in

355
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,510
text folder data and storage files they

356
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,150
also require the bitcoins as rain some

357
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,760
currency while CTB Locker provide five

358
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,050
files and decryption but the crypto

359
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,570
watterson they both will require service

360
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:31,430
private key to decrypt the files here's

361
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,480
some prevention for our protection for

362
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,170
your computer to avoid affecting from

363
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,300
this ring somewhere you can back up the

364
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,610
computer more often once the fire

365
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,890
encrypted try to restore the computer

366
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,250
from the most recent backup or restore

367
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,420
the encrypted files fear

368
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,050
forum shadow copies this method requires

369
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:59,550
the vsc service to be active before the

370
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:04,230
infection so yeah but it may work for

371
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,900
the cryptolocker and a CDP locker but

372
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,540
not for the critical war as I described

373
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,630
before crypto war removes the forum

374
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,470
shadow copies quietly at the end or you

375
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:21,990
can try some recovery software and yeah

376
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,420
that's the end of the presentation Thank

377
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:33,420
you Thank You Christie do we have any

378
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,890
questions we have a few minutes left

379
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,330
over if you have any questions for

380
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,740
Christie see one here in the center we

381
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:46,770
have a microphone okay during your

382
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,830
analyzes of the crypto lockers have you

383
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,900
encountered encountered any variant or

384
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,650
sample have made a mistake during

385
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,330
encrypting like leaving the private key

386
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,570
somewhere on or some file I mean if

387
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,120
there's still a chance that by an

388
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,340
analysis of the sample we can decrypt

389
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,660
the files without paying the ransom yeah

390
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:13,920
because they need the communication with

391
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,560
the sofa like once they receive certain

392
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,320
information that i mentioned before that

393
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,740
we sent back the private key so i don't

394
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,270
think they would just leave the private

395
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:30,240
key somewhere in the mall where yeah any

396
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,940
other questions c1 over here on the

397
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,170
right so do you know if you pay the

398
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,750
money do they really decrypt the files

399
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,080
and do not infect the same machine again

400
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,000
or you can just get infected again

401
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,320
tomorrow and a tree I heard one of my

402
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,410
friend she paid it actually and it

403
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,770
recovered but sometimes noise sometimes

404
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:59,889
not because the

405
00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:04,549
they may be trapped or maybe during they

406
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:08,149
paid up during some the server down or

407
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:11,960
something so there may be reasons but I

408
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,000
heard one of my friend she really paid

409
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,940
it and a girl recover but I don't

410
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,070
recommend you guys to pay for it and

411
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,230
yeah it means that they have a bigger

412
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,679
person in the world we have a question

413
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:30,850
up here up front is it possible that oh

414
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,460
the malware creators send back as a

415
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,149
decryption application or something to

416
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:40,009
decrypt something else then they

417
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:43,340
infected I'll know because they all have

418
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:48,169
the marker for their encrypted files

419
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:53,720
like the CTB locker they have the the

420
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,179
first d work magic be worth that to

421
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:59,509
recognize that the files encrypted so

422
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:02,419
they were just decrypt the files that

423
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:07,850
was encrypted pilot yeah any other

424
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,090
questions as in the middle here well

425
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,429
perfect thank you yeah I guess there are

426
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:16,340
quite a lot of pie lockers for mobile

427
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,250
device for it poison / android do you

428
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,870
see any difference difference between

429
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:24,440
the windows and the mobile device for I

430
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,509
mean um I kind of okay oh because I most

431
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:33,799
of the time I I spend on the windows not

432
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:36,830
that Android so I'm sorry that I I I

433
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,659
cannot answer the question your

434
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:44,059
questions out at this point yeah any

435
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:47,539
last questions all right we'll be

436
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:49,100
starting up the next session in about

437
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,690
five minutes in here so you have some

438
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,309
time to go to the red room if you choose

439
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:54,320
if not please join us in a few moments

440
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,519
Thank You Chrissy
