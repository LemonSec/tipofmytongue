1
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:06,270
okay so our final speaker for this

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,630
session Marya bolaño of semantics as I

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,160
already mentioned we are going to

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,230
continue in the topic of infected

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,330
routers and this is a pretty intriguing

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,760
case because it seems like these guys

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,400
were trying to help or fix the situation

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,390
yeah how is it really so thanks so yeah

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,490
I'm Mario I work in semantics i work for

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,260
security response i think it's actually

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,779
very good i was telling him Olivia that

12
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,820
these two dogs were together because I

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,070
think it draws like kind of same

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,989
conclusions and everything and it

15
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,030
affects kinds of the same devices so I

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,690
think it was a very good much so yeah

17
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,489
I'm going to talk today about Lena's

18
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,370
wife at it's a it's an unusual threat as

19
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,460
well for embedded devices it affects

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,920
home routers as far as we know IP

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,070
cameras and it somewhat looks like this

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,039
guy might be trying to well whoever is

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,930
behind this botnet because like the my

24
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,809
word features a botnet tube is trying to

25
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,880
clean devices instead of like well

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,860
infecting them and using them for bad

27
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,540
purposes like the case of Linux was

28
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,570
anyway so let's get it started this is a

29
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,520
rough timeline anyway the first time we

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,159
heard about linux wife Pat it was in

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,000
November 2014 a researcher actually he

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,369
found this thread in his home router so

33
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:27,869
he was having a look at there at the

34
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:29,549
router and then he was like what is this

35
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,420
running process here and well he grabbed

36
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,240
a sample he analyzed it and he did a

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,240
very good analysis but since november

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,450
that fred has about quite a bit and i

39
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,250
think well this research only he only

40
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,659
grasp the super eight so he actually

41
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,240
thought that a gang was behind this this

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,290
marvel right then on mar 2015 well we

43
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,610
detected suspicious activity related to

44
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,340
this malware so we started having a look

45
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,350
at it and then at some point we were

46
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,000
like hell doesn't like this this

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,469
actually looks interesting why don't we

48
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:06,630
do like deep analysis and we start

49
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,639
monitoring the peer-to-peer network and

50
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,530
we'll see what these guys about or what

51
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,410
this matter is about so

52
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,410
to give you an idea the infection

53
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,130
process of Linux wife at well it's not a

54
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,480
warm like it doesn't sort of replicate

55
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,680
like Linux most the guy who's behind

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,120
this he seems to have an automated

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,940
process oh he's using that process to

58
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,880
you basically infect new devices and the

59
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,500
way he is breaking into the devices is

60
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,290
juicing week 10 at Fred NLCS so you know

61
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,520
like wrote one two three four five

62
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,010
whatever we're talking about before and

63
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,560
you basically dropped onto a big box

64
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,900
console where you can start executing

65
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,470
commands right so we know he's doing

66
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,970
this we don't know if he's using any

67
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,800
exploits or anything like that but we

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,210
know at least like for sure that he's

69
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,790
using talent right so once he

70
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,650
authenticates with the device he

71
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,390
basically he detects the architecture

72
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,610
like wife Pat actually ruins a number of

73
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,930
platforms from arm to maps to SH for

74
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,420
it's actually a bite out later on on the

75
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,240
slide so I'll show you and then he

76
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,280
deploys the first eight years and you

77
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,540
know like when you have like a telling

78
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,630
connection you can't actually well

79
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,160
upload the binary like that so he's

80
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,200
using like hacks like doing printf sore

81
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,630
it goes to files and then he basically

82
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,390
construct a binary over the execution of

83
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,060
multiple commands right so once we have

84
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,709
their first eight years what he does is

85
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,380
he his mounting a temporary file system

86
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,290
in RAM and then he's copying the rest of

87
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,850
the files onto this temporary file

88
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,430
system so once all the parts are

89
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,739
transferred he executed the main threat

90
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,350
this is an interesting thing about why

91
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,140
fat and it's like it has both native

92
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,360
components and multi architecture

93
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,440
components so the reason is well there's

94
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,480
four files here or components you can

95
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,320
call them either way net vm it contains

96
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,610
the pail interpreter because the threat

97
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,489
is written in perl actually it contains

98
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,660
some of their required perl modules that

99
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,220
the thread basically requires children

100
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,470
and it contains the booting code for the

101
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,780
for the threat right then there are

102
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,480
three other binaries there basically

103
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,370
they only use that the infection stage

104
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,490
so they're using basically to infect the

105
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,169
device to transfer files over to that

106
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:26,139
device

107
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:27,879
then the main thing the main binaries

108
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,780
net under scorpion right but if we look

109
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,259
at the other files we see that well this

110
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:36,249
out they acted d'architecture

111
00:04:36,249 --> 00:04:38,949
independent modules so we have a bunch

112
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:41,729
of them the main one would be net

113
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:44,469
underscore PL that contains the whole

114
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:47,189
thread code right then we have some

115
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:50,729
static signatures on net underscore 0

116
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:53,139
those are actually malware signatures so

117
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:55,539
that threat is actually trying to kill

118
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:57,819
malware that is that has previously

119
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:00,520
implicated the router will get we'll see

120
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,620
more about it in a few slides anyway and

121
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,400
then the Cu files knit one and net for

122
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,139
that are related to the peer-to-peer

123
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:11,009
network so they contain like the nodes

124
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:14,620
the seeds whatever right then there's no

125
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,539
file that contains auxiliary modules net

126
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:18,759
and score cheap and finally another file

127
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,860
nathan is called CF that contains the

128
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,800
configure is so nothing is physiol aside

129
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,900
that that fred is actually written in

130
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,219
berk right so when we started looking at

131
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:33,219
it we were well we basically we do like

132
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:35,560
everyone does if you run the strings on

133
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,419
the file and you were like okay what's

134
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:39,550
what's in this file right so we saw so

135
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,610
much translated to a static pearl so

136
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,589
we're like okay we have never analyzed

137
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:46,300
the pill I mean it's read written

138
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,550
impaired we're going to need like a way

139
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,379
of extracting the files are in there

140
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:53,560
this is sort of like a pie to exe sort

141
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,729
of thing so basically going to put a

142
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,069
binary that contains paired code and it

143
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:00,939
bundles interpreter to right so we have

144
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:02,710
to investigate a little bit we read the

145
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,779
source code of a static pair and we

146
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:07,419
wrote a few script and when we did that

147
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:09,939
we were able to extract the main files

148
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:12,219
from the main by now this is no from the

149
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:14,139
multi architecture files this is from

150
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:15,819
the main binary met on the scorpion

151
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:18,849
right so this actually bunch of files

152
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:22,719
interesting here I remember this one PL

153
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,229
pack and remember that won't boot and

154
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:28,779
then the rest of them they actually

155
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:31,419
regular pair modules that you can find

156
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:34,089
well in a standard distribution some of

157
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:35,019
them they might have been installed

158
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,050
after that but like do just regular pair

159
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,409
modules right

160
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:42,709
uh so if we have a look at the pair

161
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,300
modest that the threat this isn't the

162
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,759
most interesting ones we know that he's

163
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:49,309
using coral which is for threading feels

164
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:53,239
like there is a multi threat threat we

165
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:55,429
know that he's using compressed lsat f

166
00:06:55,429 --> 00:06:58,999
so he's using that for compression he's

167
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:02,599
using also any event and EV the tree is

168
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:05,689
actually written like in a in an event

169
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:09,189
model programming model you know like so

170
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:11,179
events have registered and whenever

171
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:12,649
something happens there's a callback

172
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:16,369
that gets triggered and so on right then

173
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,579
we have C ball which stands for concise

174
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:22,339
binary object representation so it's

175
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:24,439
just a way of serializing an uncivilized

176
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,869
impel it'll be like if you familiar with

177
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:30,559
Python pickle right and the last thing

178
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,989
is lift on crypt so he's using that for

179
00:07:32,989 --> 00:07:35,959
elliptic curve cryptography he's using

180
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,669
that to verify signatures and so on

181
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:40,539
we're going to see more about it now

182
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:43,909
this is the pl pack file that I was

183
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:46,519
telling you to remember so the threat is

184
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,990
actually the funny thing is like the

185
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,490
threads is not really a full-scale it or

186
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,559
anything the pale files are just

187
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:53,779
minified and then they get bundled into

188
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:56,240
the thing however the multi architecture

189
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,179
modules they get loaded by this PL pack

190
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:02,569
module right and the way they stored on

191
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:05,360
the multi architecture files is they are

192
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,329
basically compressed and civilized so

193
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:11,509
the guy just decompress s and then these

194
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:13,729
he realises and then he loads the module

195
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:16,849
on demand so this actually loaded so

196
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:19,779
whenever he's doing like use this model

197
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:23,300
this thing kicks in and it automatically

198
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,319
finds the module unloads it right

199
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,779
alright so we were like okay we're going

200
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:31,579
to have to create like sort of a tool or

201
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:34,549
something she be able to unpack the

202
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,049
files from the multi architecture

203
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,879
modules and we thought it was a good

204
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:41,089
idea to also to be able to repack so

205
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:42,649
that means like if we want to patch

206
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:44,509
something in the threat we will have the

207
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:47,269
ability to basically patch those multi

208
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:49,160
architecture modules right I'm going to

209
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,649
show you later we would use that for but

210
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:53,030
yet we create a little

211
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,830
and so the next step obviously was to

212
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,980
extract the files from within the multi

213
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,480
architecture modules this is from the

214
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,060
net PL module which contains most of the

215
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,250
threat code and you can say well there's

216
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,700
a few interesting files this is this is

217
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,140
this files are just plain paper files

218
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,270
anyway so they not byte code or anything

219
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,700
like that they only minified but you can

220
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,790
t minus Phi them and then well you'll be

221
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,860
able to read the source code right so

222
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,180
there's a few interesting ones like

223
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,380
disinfect or upgrade these are back

224
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,120
towards this P legs we're going to get

225
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,980
into a few of them now anyway so so now

226
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,210
we're going to get into the

227
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,750
functionality of the of the bottom right

228
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,640
so interesting things for network

229
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,040
communications it uses a single inbound

230
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,340
tcp port so it binds to report it

231
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,620
actually selects that poor randomly so

232
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,930
that's actually I mean that prevented us

233
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,460
from scanning the whole internet with

234
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,620
Seth map or whatever because we couldn't

235
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,800
know exactly which port was it and he

236
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,760
has a series of MAGIX that he uses

237
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,270
basically right so whenever like there's

238
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,180
an inbound tcp communication to they are

239
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,520
to that to the port tag it's using for

240
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,740
communications it looks for this Maddox

241
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,460
so if it sees like I am ex whatever it's

242
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,100
going to call the CC port handling

243
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,860
mechanism right if it is this thing it

244
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,100
will call the tcp legs well you can see

245
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,290
actually if he sees get it assumes its

246
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,320
HTTP request right so it actually it

247
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,560
bundles a HTTP server and well they

248
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,320
might excite use for that purpose right

249
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,440
so the peer-to-peer model it also uses

250
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,320
that communication mechanism it's

251
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,470
implemented on BN h PP and it's mainly

252
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,260
due to distribute updates so that threat

253
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,070
actually hosts the files well the same

254
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,860
files that are used to be distributed a

255
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,360
threat across the whole peer-to-peer

256
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,050
network right then again like updates

257
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,380
assigned with the bot master ski so we

258
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,900
didn't find any obvious weaknesses so

259
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,800
with

260
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,880
don't think there's a way of taking the

261
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,390
network down right and they appear to be

262
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,279
a network is only used for that we're

263
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,660
only I mean we're going to see more

264
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,720
about it later anyway then we get into

265
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,880
the malware scanner I found it weird

266
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,769
that it has a malware scanner as I was

267
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:24,050
like well maybe he's trying to be like

268
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,910
the only one in the box so he has all

269
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,110
the resources for himself you know but I

270
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,910
don't know well I'll ask you later

271
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,870
anyway to see what you think so well he

272
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,870
has like a malware signature style

273
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,600
currently he gets more than 4,000 16

274
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,390
signatures which is a lot and within

275
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,430
those there are no families because i

276
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,070
looked at the swings so he's this is

277
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,290
like a mini antivirus within the threat

278
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,560
you know and well well you can see here

279
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,779
like how he stands so basically what

280
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:58,820
he's doing is he lists the processes he

281
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,470
is cans in particular parts like in the

282
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,230
road and user and speaking whatever and

283
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,990
then he ruins this this piece of code

284
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,660
civ lamar matches he has some special

285
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,750
handling for you p x files he has

286
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,050
different signatures like he has

287
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,370
signatures based on his strings or

288
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:20,450
hashes i think on COCs or whatever so I

289
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,740
mean it's fair complete for being a mad

290
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,420
at me for being a threat so let's move

291
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,970
on anyway then another interesting thing

292
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,459
it has is it has a tentative replacement

293
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:36,770
so you know like the threat actually it

294
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,630
breaks into the box through telnet and

295
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,990
then the next thing it fries is it tries

296
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,940
to look for this processes and it kills

297
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,279
them and then it shows if you connect to

298
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:49,370
the box it will show you this message so

299
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,529
then it has been close to about further

300
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:53,810
infection of this device please disable

301
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,240
tenet change the net passwords and or

302
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,730
update the film work so that's why I'm

303
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,220
visual it looks like a message to their

304
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,510
admins of the device right let's move on

305
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,850
then we're getting into the back doors

306
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,910
it actually has some backers right so

307
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,050
one of them is CC port so if you

308
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,610
remember that Mike there that was

309
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,680
associated to the well to this module

310
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,639
this is this is the one it's implemented

311
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,040
on B and C support and then again like

312
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,620
commands have to be signed with the

313
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,389
ecdsa key so if you don't have Turkey

314
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:31,250
you can't do anything and the

315
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,839
functionality that is implemented is

316
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,870
basically to retrieve the status of the

317
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:39,610
bot to execute / code so he basically

318
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,449
allows you to do an eval more or less

319
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:46,670
then it has some file operations like to

320
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,970
write your remote file to retrieve has

321
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,000
to rename to change the permissions of a

322
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,970
file so nothing like really that might

323
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,399
be really really useful anyway it has

324
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,550
the ability to restart the prep and

325
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,899
tweet ruffolo and finally to get an

326
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:05,959
interactive shell but this looks more

327
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:08,480
like the bogan gone so if you know what

328
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,240
I mean so it's more like he's trying to

329
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,060
base maybe if there's an issue with the

330
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,709
threat try to log in and see what

331
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:17,870
happened you know I don't that's what it

332
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,709
looks to me anyway and this is the other

333
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:24,949
back to lack he has so it's called tcp

334
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:28,459
Lex it's implemented on TCP legs again

335
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:30,410
commands that have to be signed with a

336
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,430
CD s a key and it allows you to create

337
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,350
toenails from one box to another so it's

338
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,170
like sort of a proxy I haven't well we

339
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,670
haven't seen cinema using this thing

340
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,079
anyway but i'll talk about that now so

341
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:50,979
attribution we basically don't know but

342
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:52,970
this is a conversation we've been

343
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,670
running like monitoring thing for since

344
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,360
march april so over the last few months

345
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,160
we have seen Dale the bottom s are

346
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,290
actually connected to our horny pot

347
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,110
right so what we've seen is like this

348
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,209
guy every time he's connecting is coming

349
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:12,470
from tour this is the iaan command that

350
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,170
i was talking to you about before this

351
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,660
when using this actually this help don't

352
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,209
doesn't have to be signed and it replies

353
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:23,689
with a bunch of details like that that

354
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,720
contains for instance like the boat ID

355
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,679
it contains a challenge it contains the

356
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,970
version of the bot because there's a

357
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,019
bunch of different things right

358
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:36,329
then that challenge is actually used to

359
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:38,610
sign the next sequence and here you can

360
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,869
see like he's using for instance the

361
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:41,970
evil thing right so he's going to

362
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,029
execute code we've seen him doing this

363
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:47,879
but in this case he's doing any well to

364
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,100
get like the being config attention

365
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,929
Sookie's he's doing that to basically

366
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:54,449
retriever value from the running threat

367
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:57,029
so it's not really anything malicious

368
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,980
right and we haven't seen him doing

369
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,149
anything malicious yet more things that

370
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:06,389
we found within the threadscode does

371
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:09,299
this command that says to any NSA and

372
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:12,119
FBI agents written this please consider

373
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:14,040
whether defending the US Constitution

374
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,019
against all enemies foreign or domestic

375
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:17,879
requires you to follow the Snowden's

376
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,939
example this actually Richard Stallman

377
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,819
signature but I mean I don't think

378
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:26,579
Richards time I wrote this but maybe

379
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:28,739
it's a wing to the tracking or research

380
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:31,110
community you know that's what it looks

381
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:36,269
to me monitoring the threat so we've

382
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:38,220
been monitoring for a while how are we

383
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,670
doing this we basically argues in our

384
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,529
toolbox the tool that I showed you

385
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:46,679
before to disable the back doors so it's

386
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:49,499
harmless and we can execute safely more

387
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:53,369
or less we added a few more debug

388
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:56,009
messages so we can get more information

389
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:59,179
about the peer-to-peer component and

390
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:01,589
well we run the threat obviously on an

391
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:04,079
internet-connected box and we're using

392
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,819
the AAA in command to retrieve

393
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,179
information about infected nodes right

394
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:12,839
so when we have this running we retrieve

395
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,359
like well we basically run a scan on

396
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,359
those infected Mouse and then we send

397
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,539
the events to a local q message server

398
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:23,760
and then we put those into splunk that

399
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,309
we have a fancy dashboard and and all

400
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:27,839
that so that's what I'm going to show

401
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,570
you now this is actually with the

402
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,710
proof-of-concept python domain script to

403
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,350
retrieve like the reduced like the AI n

404
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,899
command and we'll send that to the host

405
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:42,179
and then we basically with reflect

406
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:44,880
challenge time but ID the version of the

407
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,190
bot gets it right so

408
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,560
I wanted to do a demo life to show you

409
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,360
how the threat is running and then we're

410
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,930
going to get into the conclusion so

411
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,740
hopefully the internet will be working

412
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,080
all right so can you say that or I'll

413
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,840
make it bigger all right so I'm going to

414
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,160
SS it into the box or we're monitoring

415
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:22,870
the threat and should be the screen so

416
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,660
what we what do you say now its a mix of

417
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,870
the book messages that we are it and

418
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,820
that the boogie messages from the threat

419
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,980
itself so the threat itself has a lot of

420
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,570
the book information that its output in

421
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,480
a real time right what you're saying

422
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,940
here is our only scan so whenever we

423
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,880
discover a new note we connect to it

424
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,010
would use that proof of concept name I

425
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,220
mean like the the ability to play to get

426
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,560
the boat ID we get the architecture we

427
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,460
get we get all the details that

428
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,190
basically reflects right and we

429
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,440
restarted every so often so this is only

430
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,630
a way to map it to map the nodes I'm

431
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:07,540
gonna restart it anyway so you can see

432
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,610
here this is my own message if it

433
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,890
doesn't go chief as well Jay injected

434
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,070
code that means that well we were able

435
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,080
to patch it then you see like the thread

436
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,570
running its own modules here like the

437
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,640
discipline module blah blah then is

438
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,940
trying she of if you see their block the

439
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,830
1080 month so basically is trying to

440
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,370
look for the tenth Digimon and kill it

441
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,800
and replace it with its own and now

442
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,830
we're saying well again I'm discovering

443
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,870
notes so I'm connecting to them and I'm

444
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,660
getting well the information from those

445
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,600
notes so i'm gonna show that to you in

446
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,770
Splunk as well

447
00:19:54,350 --> 00:20:00,260
hopefully all right

448
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:07,429
it might take a little bit your load Sam

449
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:13,030
on the VPN come on

450
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,559
alright

451
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,640
I have a video as well so if we don't to

452
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,860
get it to work I'll show you on the clip

453
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:49,760
the demo effect come on all right i'll

454
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,850
show you the video so it's pretty much

455
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,200
the same thing that I was showing to you

456
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,870
before so basically we connect to the

457
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,250
thread blah blah i'm going to skip the

458
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,420
first fire because it's the exact same

459
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,810
thing and then we connect to the splunk

460
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,240
and they said i don't know if you see

461
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,950
right there well this is this is

462
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,100
basically the different architectures

463
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,570
the the countries that are running

464
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,070
infected notes the main one seems to be

465
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,830
China then we have brazil and i think

466
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,710
india is the next one we also won't like

467
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,170
a https can't you try to guess what kind

468
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,430
of devices they're in fact i think

469
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,750
because like the malware doesn't kill

470
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,660
the HTTP server right so we're able to

471
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,420
retrieve like the server header or the

472
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,780
title of the website if there's one so

473
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,250
that way we can get an idea of what kind

474
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,790
of device it is infected so I think now

475
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:42,110
what I'm going to do here I can show you

476
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,270
this after the talk as well if anybody's

477
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,700
interested anyway so we get the event in

478
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,530
the splunk right that's an IP address

479
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,620
that we know that is infected and if i

480
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,320
connect to it you're going to see their

481
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,310
ring Karen Amish it so every note is

482
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,840
what every not every know is drawn in

483
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,400
the same message because like not every

484
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,010
know is not for every note I think

485
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,590
that's right is able to kill turn it

486
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,970
sometimes i think is using credentials

487
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,520
that might not be wrote so here you can

488
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,470
see something that seems to be an IP

489
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:18,230
camera and this is pretty much it i'm

490
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,300
going to move into the conclusion funny

491
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,130
but is interested anyway i can i can

492
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,560
show you after there after the top I

493
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,220
actually loaded so well this is what I

494
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,350
was telling you like Chinese seems to be

495
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:35,390
the main country Brazil the Mexico so I

496
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,330
guess it's just like the user base of

497
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,980
infected devices is bigger there and

498
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,020
maybe it is not they know that's patch I

499
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,550
don't think they've been like 30

500
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:47,870
countries or anything and then we can

501
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,880
that life again just for the sake of

502
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:58,430
turn it so I'll pick up one of them come

503
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:04,430
on so if we get this IP it'll probably

504
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,820
be running

505
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,230
that one doesn't seem to be running it

506
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:24,730
now well anyway do you get the idea so

507
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:28,390
where are the conclusions so with I

508
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,220
think it's somewhat is sophisticated

509
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,700
Fred the guy seems to master the pair

510
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,080
language because if you read the source

511
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,060
code and it really looks like it's very

512
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,920
well written he might be like an old

513
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,260
school guy or something that is always

514
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,390
written / because not nowadays who's

515
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,400
driving impaired well well maybe some

516
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,350
people there's no action malicious

517
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,540
payloads bundled with in the death

518
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,610
threat so we don't have any of the D

519
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,880
dose or a sniffing and the I mean you've

520
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,430
taken over router so if you're really

521
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,290
interested in doing bad things you can

522
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,380
do them like we've seen with linux moose

523
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,540
it's not a few scary or encrypted so I

524
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,060
don't know it has lots of the book

525
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,150
messages that you can pretty much like

526
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,460
guess what the thing is doing there are

527
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,290
references to the hacking community to

528
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,080
the richest on man email signature it

529
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,020
has a malware cleaner and it's skill

530
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,990
internet there's normally and we think

531
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,000
with monitoring this thing for four

532
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,560
months now and we haven't seen any

533
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,130
malicious actions being carried so is it

534
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,830
really a good thread is there an IOT

535
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,990
vigilante out there trying to keep

536
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,240
infected devices out of the bad guy's

537
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,940
hands I don't know what you think that's

538
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:50,890
it thank you Mario really interesting

539
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,230
talk and I'm sure there's going to be

540
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,790
many questions because you don't seem a

541
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:58,050
lower like this every day so please

542
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:07,080
so um I mean you are indicating by the

543
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,140
the first image of Batman that yeah it's

544
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,630
this might be a good thing the savior of

545
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:16,740
the poor and the naive we've seen mother

546
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,840
before like back in the days with spy I

547
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,380
and see us botnets that they were you

548
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,880
know I think selling each other before

549
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,549
the joint forces and don't you think

550
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:29,100
that it might be more reasonable that

551
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,830
this is a test run or just you know

552
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,600
creating the button it for for the sales

553
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,090
activities or yeah I mean obviously we

554
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,280
know won't have the potential and this

555
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,840
guy might not have been done anything

556
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,669
yet but he might do something in the

557
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:43,710
future he has his own bought master key

558
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,570
he can do whatever he wants because he

559
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,270
has the ability to run code so i don't

560
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,870
want to say like his for sure good guy i

561
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,860
just want to say that it's an unusual

562
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,370
way of doing things if you're a bad guy

563
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,049
and yeah I remember like we've seen my

564
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:00,780
word like it was doing that basically to

565
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,700
kick other malwares out of the box and

566
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,799
well have all the resources for

567
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,270
themselves so I don't know it's just

568
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,500
like the whole thing it's a little bit

569
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,809
weird but obviously it could be a bad

570
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:16,100
guy as well you know

571
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:26,080
did you find any clues by looking at

572
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,759
those 416 signatures as to who is trying

573
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:33,549
to protect us from I looked at a few of

574
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:36,039
them but like many of them they seem to

575
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:39,909
be just like well would we usually use

576
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:41,740
for signatures like a random thing in

577
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,320
the middle of nowhere and you don't

578
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,629
really know what if that belongs to any

579
00:26:46,629 --> 00:26:48,730
known malware I mean obviously we could

580
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,440
have worried like I don't know in

581
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,059
virustotal whatever I'm try to get more

582
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:54,220
samples and yeah I think we could we

583
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,049
could map their families but I didn't

584
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:58,240
invest a lot of time on that I saw a few

585
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,369
strings that I know that they were for

586
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:04,450
known my were targeting routers and

587
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,669
other embedded devices so I was like

588
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:09,820
okay it looks like he's definitely doing

589
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,240
this to try to kill malware but I didn't

590
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,710
really investigated that done much

591
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:26,190
how resource-intensive is this boat so

592
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,280
does it cause any harm I do remember the

593
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,670
virus course was 2004 and nets guy we

594
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,560
chained it up doing quite a lot more

595
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,730
harm than it did good so how safe this

596
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,600
is so and do can you see any kind of fan

597
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,180
tracks because let's face it we have

598
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,720
internet on everything soon and factory

599
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,520
shut down because somebody wanted to

600
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,350
prevent other version or getting there

601
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:57,000
doesn't sound fun all right can you

602
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,320
repeat a pistol again because like I

603
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,140
think I missed the first part so how

604
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,870
dangerous it is system wise so is it

605
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,060
resource intense yeah or any other kind

606
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,310
of a potential risks I think it might be

607
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,520
pre resource intensive but you know like

608
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,800
we're talking about devices like IP

609
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,990
cameras and routers and routers I guess

610
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,560
maybe nowadays they actually have some

611
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,060
some resources like because they've

612
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,470
running Linux and you can have like a

613
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,830
lot of stuff thrown in there I don't

614
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,650
think it's bad really performance wise

615
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,500
for the embedded device and let's maybe

616
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,540
on one of those IP cameras and stuff

617
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,640
where he might actually be causing some

618
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,900
issues related to performance but yeah

619
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,300
dangerous like the it is 10 years

620
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,100
because like it has stuff functionality

621
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,900
built in and if the guy wants to use it

622
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,440
he might use it as in issues that may

623
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,340
arise from tip the fact that it's worth

624
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,530
is running on the device I can see that

625
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,110
happening because I don't think the guys

626
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:01,110
testing every device that he's infected

627
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,120
you know so he's probably not doing QA

628
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,090
and all that but yeah it could happen

629
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,509
did you also choose a Chinese IP to test

630
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:17,690
you a honeypot no we were running it on

631
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,210
a the IP address actually I don't even

632
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,440
know what its face i think it's based in

633
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,999
in the UK but you know like the way

634
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:28,159
we're doing it is we're mapping the

635
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,749
peer-to-peer network so i don't think

636
00:29:29,749 --> 00:29:32,960
it's very relevant where we are the guy

637
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,840
doesn't seem too I mean we obviously we

638
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,029
want to see and this is something i

639
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:40,009
haven't seen being attacked by this

640
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:41,450
thread and we're running some of the

641
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,789
honey pots we're capturing like a lot of

642
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:48,110
my we're like that did oohs and a lot of

643
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,809
stuff but i had never seen any of our

644
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:52,820
honey pots being attacked by this guy I

645
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,399
mean so I don't know which way he's

646
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:56,899
doing it because you know he might be

647
00:29:56,899 --> 00:29:58,999
looking for he might only be attacking

648
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:00,649
like particular Network ranges where he

649
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:04,429
knows his this router is by chynaking or

650
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:06,830
whatever it's always within this IP

651
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,499
range or IP blocks so he might only be

652
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:11,450
scanning those or he might have some

653
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,279
signatures we might have like signatures

654
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,830
for based on the HTTP title or whatever

655
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,350
and if he doesn't find what he wants he

656
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,480
won't connect to the tenets port I'm

657
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,590
deployed a thread doesn't support any IP

658
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,629
specific commands so it's a sense I

659
00:30:26,629 --> 00:30:29,629
commands special soup specifically to

660
00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:32,090
one IP or a range of it there's no

661
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,970
command and control so okay so just over

662
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:39,490
PA it's a spear to beer okay thanks

663
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:46,210
I assume I have one oh there's one yeah

664
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,920
how many devices are we talking about

665
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,540
yeah that's a good thing I didn't

666
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,640
mention that we think it's in the order

667
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,880
of tens of thousands of devices one of

668
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,610
the hair things that we face when we

669
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,440
were trying to map the network it's like

670
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,970
you know a lot of these devices they

671
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,830
actually they get restarted every cell

672
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:07,850
phone so and many of them they might be

673
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:10,430
sitting at static IP addresses when we

674
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,620
implemented the code to wait for the

675
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,500
boat ID we know that that ID was unique

676
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,450
you know but I mean unique IDs since

677
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,940
April I think we have nearly like

678
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,180
600,000 but I guess many of those

679
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,800
devices they actually delivery started

680
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,100
and reinfected you know so we're

681
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,130
balancing based on our skies we guess

682
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,360
it's in the order of tens of thousands

683
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,800
it seems we're out of time here so

684
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,570
please join me again thanking Mario for

685
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,230
his great talk

686
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:47,130
[Applause]
