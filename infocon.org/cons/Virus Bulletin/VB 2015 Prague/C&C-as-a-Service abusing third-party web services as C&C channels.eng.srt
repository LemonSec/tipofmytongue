1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
okay and that was perfect time and

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,910
apparently we are ready to start the

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,469
last session of this of this particular

4
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:15,299
morning track artery left ear is going

5
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,180
to present it's going to talk about

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,310
command and control as a service and

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,980
you're going to learn about what else

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,500
apart from Twitter you can use to

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,650
control your botanists all right over to

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,430
you Thanks good afternoon everyone like

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,160
you just heard I'm our protector I work

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,700
as a researcher at f-secure and today

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,930
I'll be talking about C&C as a service

14
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,730
abusing third-party web services for a

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,320
malware command and control so well most

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,670
of you are probably familiar with the

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,949
network level detection and blocking of

18
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,670
malware it's often seen as a scalable

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,460
and a cost-effective way of identifying

20
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,500
malicious activity in organizations

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,659
networks the big part of that is a

22
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:08,369
detecting and blocking commander control

23
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:11,189
traffic so the malware communicating

24
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:14,100
with the command and control servers but

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,619
of course the better we as defenders get

26
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,710
at detecting and blocking the traffic

27
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,150
the attackers will try and come up with

28
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,850
new ways of hiding the traffic trying to

29
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,450
evade our detections and there are a lot

30
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,130
of ways they can try and hide but

31
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,000
probably the most obvious is to increase

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,970
the traffic one way or another and try

33
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,750
and hide it that way

34
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,010
this quote is from the malware report

35
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,540
from the first half of this year from

36
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,240
motive security labs and there's two

37
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,360
interesting details here first it seems

38
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,310
we aren't very good at detecting and

39
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,230
blocking network traffic since only two

40
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,270
point six percent of malware that

41
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,950
they've seen actually even bothers to

42
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,820
encrypt the CNC traffic but what a lot

43
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,100
more interesting from my point of view

44
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,610
is that they go on to say that even for

45
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,200
the encrypted traffic most of that they

46
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,240
could still detect just by inspecting it

47
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,450
regardless of the encryption and in the

48
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,640
report they list some reasons for

49
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,220
detecting that they talk about unique

50
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,290
identifying characteristics of the

51
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,630
initial handshake for instance or for

52
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,090
the key exchange and they say that they

53
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,690
sometimes see malware that uses its own

54
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,240
crypto it's rolled its own cryptography

55
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,270
end and the result is fixed binary

56
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,220
content in the encrypted traffic and

57
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,210
they're able to use that to to detect it

58
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,970
but we all know rolling your own crypto

59
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,600
is a bad idea why not use something like

60
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,180
HTTPS the SSL let others bother with the

61
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,959
difficult stuff and use that and well

62
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:04,350
malware does that as well so in the

63
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,209
infamous office of personal management

64
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,260
hack according to news reports it took

65
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,720
official ziva 11 months from the initial

66
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,540
breach to actually detect malicious

67
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,030
activity on the networks and even when

68
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,680
they did detect it that was mainly

69
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,560
because they were able to intercept SSL

70
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,450
traffic and decrypted a look at the

71
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,390
actual content and this is something

72
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:32,299
that motive also notes in their report

73
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:38,040
so what motive says as well is that that

74
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,739
standard crypto something like SSL for

75
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,290
instance is more difficult to detect but

76
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,239
again interestingly they say that they

77
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,239
can oft oftentimes accurately identify

78
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,970
the malware simply based on the IP or

79
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,609
DNS or based on the IP address or the

80
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,829
domain name so essentially even though

81
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:56,400
they don't

82
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,950
have visibility into the content they're

83
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,799
able to use the metadata to identify

84
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,000
that it's malicious activity so what

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,620
then is all this fuss about there's a

86
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,560
Russian cyber warriors hiding on Twitter

87
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,989
or the world's most sophisticated cyber

88
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,399
weapon these are sensationalist

89
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,699
headlines from media like foreign policy

90
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,340
and financial times but another thing

91
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,250
these have in common is that in all of

92
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,919
these cases the malware related to the

93
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,650
incidents that are being reported the

94
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,620
malware has used third-party web

95
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,090
services as its command and control

96
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,039
channel services like these for instance

97
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,600
they might have used comments or

98
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,940
Microsoft TechNet or they might have

99
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,610
used tweets or Facebook posts or

100
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,910
something like Dropbox for instance

101
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,580
basically any web service that in one

102
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,580
way or another allows users to store and

103
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,860
retrieve content can be abused as a

104
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,570
command and control channel and one of

105
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,919
the reports that the previous headlines

106
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,539
referred to is a recent report from fire

107
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,880
right we're in the conclusions they also

108
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:22,820
note this and so they also say that

109
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,199
malware that employs legitimate web

110
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,780
services is a lot harder for defenders

111
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:33,570
to to note but what what then makes it

112
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:38,070
so much harder well the first challenge

113
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,680
that I've kind of hinted at already is

114
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,380
the fact that if they're using proper

115
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,740
crypto sounds like SSL for instance you

116
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,710
can't use the content to identify or

117
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,750
discern between malicious and normally

118
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,630
she's traffic there's an exception of

119
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,310
course if you're using active

120
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,500
interception of SSL but that's its own

121
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,800
kind of worms with its own problems if

122
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,150
you don't want to get into that then

123
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,310
there you can't look at the content

124
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,130
you're you have to rely on the metadata

125
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,320
but if the traffic's going to Twitter

126
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,720
or Facebook or Google servers for

127
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,060
instance how do you know when it's

128
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,830
malicious traffic and how do you know

129
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,680
when it's just your users using google

130
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,960
docs for instance or even Google

131
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,500
searches it basically there aren't many

132
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,300
good options of course some

133
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,300
organizations can also do policies to

134
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,950
limit the attack surface for instance

135
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,160
than file-sharing services or than

136
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,530
social media but I highly doubt there's

137
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,840
any organization that is willing to

138
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,360
enact a policy that bans all third-party

139
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,120
web services or all web services so that

140
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,950
probably isn't going to help too much

141
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,270
and while this is a problem from for

142
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,310
detecting and for dependent or

143
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,140
preventing these types of things and

144
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,660
noticing when something bad has happened

145
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,860
it's also a problem for incident

146
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,620
response because traditionally you could

147
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,290
look at net flow or traffic logs or peak

148
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,600
apps both to figure out what's happened

149
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,060
and what they did what did they steal

150
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,700
but also for instance if you have a

151
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,560
known command and control server you

152
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,210
could look for other hosts in your

153
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,150
networks connecting to that same server

154
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,670
but again if you don't have visibility

155
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,500
into the content you rely on the

156
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,650
metadata but if the metadata just says

157
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,030
that there's traffic going to twitter

158
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,400
how do you know which which hosts are

159
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,590
infected and which hosts just you know

160
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,610
belong to people who like to use Twitter

161
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,240
then there's also other challenges for

162
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,180
instance related to take downs it's not

163
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,430
that there aren't other options it's

164
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,530
more that traditional methods or

165
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,540
traditional techniques won't work and we

166
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,270
have to come up with new ways we as

167
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,000
traditionally if you knew there was a

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,010
malicious server you try and collaborate

169
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,140
with with the hosting provider or with

170
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,000
certs or law enforcement and have the

171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,070
server taken down but if that server

172
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,140
belongs to Twitter they probably don't

173
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,210
want to take the entire server down of

174
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,970
course you can work with them and

175
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,960
they'll most likely help to you know

176
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,630
remove the no malicious accounts but

177
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,700
while you spend a month going through

178
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,830
the bureaucracy and finding the contacts

179
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,540
and communicating these are services

180
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,639
that are designed to

181
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,830
generate as many new users as possible

182
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,020
so the registration process the signup

183
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,639
process takes half a minute or a minute

184
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,370
maybe so by the time you spent a month

185
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,200
working with twitter to get the account

186
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,289
taken down they could have i know they

187
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:38,700
could have registered as many new

188
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,860
accounts as they want so it's it's not a

189
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,370
scalable option in that sense and

190
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,190
similar issues with sync calling as well

191
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,529
which often helps for instance in

192
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,630
identifying how big a problem some

193
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,670
malware campaign for instance is when

194
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,670
you can see see how many victims are

195
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,750
contacting the command and control

196
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,390
server by sinkhole in the domain but

197
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,579
again if the domain is dropbox com or

198
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:05,790
twitter com you can't sync all that so

199
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,089
you can't use those traditional methods

200
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:10,380
or traditional techniques you have to

201
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,360
come up with new new options but then

202
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,120
what what does this look like in

203
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,829
practice well at its simplest it's it's

204
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:25,880
it's surprisingly simple actually

205
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,860
because in many cases malware doesn't

206
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,740
even have to rewrite the mother office

207
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,060
don't need to rewrite the command and

208
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,060
control protocols they can just route it

209
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,370
through legitimate services proxy

210
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,199
through services like for instance the

211
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:44,070
case of dr. McCoy Doc's a malware from

212
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,459
2012 I think semantics published about

213
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,970
which actually wrote its commander

214
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,790
control traffic be a Google Docs but

215
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,190
there's a nice little feature in google

216
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,709
docs called viewer that allows you to

217
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:02,550
pass it in arbitrary URL and Google will

218
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,380
go and fetch the resource at that URL

219
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,070
and it will present it back to you so in

220
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,630
a sense what the malware does is it will

221
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,120
ask Google to contact the commander

222
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,640
control server so on the victim network

223
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,560
all you'll see is traffic going to

224
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,839
Google's servers but the malware will

225
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,399
actually get the same response back from

226
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,459
the command and control server but that

227
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,529
means you lose all of the visibility

228
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:28,170
suddenly and since it's it's SSL you

229
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,540
don't see the URL parameters you just

230
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,949
know it's going to Google but you have

231
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:34,380
no idea if it's legitimate use of Google

232
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,930
Docs or whether it's malicious of course

233
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:37,620
they

234
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,870
is a simple example there are a lot more

235
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,040
complex use cases as well for instance

236
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,630
using third-party services to establish

237
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,480
command and control channel where when a

238
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,010
malware wants to connect to its command

239
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,020
and control server it will first connect

240
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,270
to a third-party service fetch fetch

241
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,060
some resource that tells it where the

242
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,440
actual command and control servers so

243
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,110
usually to receive or it will find an IP

244
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,490
address for instance for the current

245
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,290
active command and control server and

246
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,270
then it will connect that be are some

247
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,140
other means and the benefit of course is

248
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,640
that if the actual command and control

249
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,290
server is taken down or the eyepiece

250
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,630
booked the attackers just set up a new

251
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,810
server do a new tweet or post a new

252
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,029
comment or whatever and next time the

253
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:22,380
malware is trying to connect the command

254
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,910
and control server it will get the new

255
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,000
updated IP address or domain name an

256
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,430
example for instance is jana cova also

257
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,839
known as duct which first surfaced as a

258
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,490
backdoor written in python on OSX and

259
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,100
then later it was rewritten in BBS for

260
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,790
windows and it will use for instance

261
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,190
youtube comments where the number in the

262
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,650
comment will be divided by a constant

263
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,740
and that's actually or converted to exit

264
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,610
a similar and that's the hexadecimal

265
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,690
representation of the IP address and it

266
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,209
didn't just use youtube it use the blog

267
00:11:57,209 --> 00:11:59,850
post comments as well and it even used

268
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,600
the ever trendy Google+ in some cases

269
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,250
and there's a lot of examples of malware

270
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,750
that does this with a variety of

271
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,940
services anything like Microsoft TechNet

272
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,950
comments or Google code google groups

273
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,800
blogging services facebook even in the

274
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,170
case of foxy it is the russian social

275
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,450
media site for the for the same same

276
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,690
purposes and again this isn't a new

277
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,630
thing there's for instance this bulletin

278
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,080
from Adele about a botnet that sonicwall

279
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,730
researchers have found that use Twitter

280
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,070
and Tumblr as part of its command and

281
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,860
control mechanisms and this report is

282
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,750
from 2009 so it's it's it's it's an old

283
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,540
problem in some sense as well but of

284
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,339
course even in these cases there is

285
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:48,630
still a actual command and control

286
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,850
server that they connect to but there

287
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,750
are lots of cases

288
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,300
well where the malware doesn't rely on

289
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,970
any attacker operated servers at all

290
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,750
it'll rely entirely on the on those

291
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,920
third-party services now I I haven't

292
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,900
been able to collect nice screenshots of

293
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,960
this in action but luckily NSA's good at

294
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,450
collecting a lot of things and Edward

295
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,990
Snowden helps us here this is a slide

296
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,590
that Snowden leaked from NSA that shows

297
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,500
a Byzantine hates a Chinese apt group in

298
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,080
2009 using Facebook where the malware

299
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,690
will do a Facebook or post to Facebook

300
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,580
and then the attackers will reply to

301
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,510
that with new commands and again there

302
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,300
are a lot of other examples of this as

303
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,610
well things like file-sharing services

304
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,530
for instance one drieborg cloud me being

305
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:44,220
used or webmail services an interesting

306
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,910
case here is the apt one samples org

307
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,650
Luke's mail and macrame which used

308
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,330
google talk and msn messenger

309
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,910
respectively where those are simple

310
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,310
backdoors just no remote access tools

311
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,190
almost like ssh into the into the victim

312
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,890
and of course for that it's nice to have

313
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,610
a responsive protocol and no responsive

314
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,030
a way of interacting with the victims

315
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,820
and that's always a engineering

316
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,640
challenge but instant messaging services

317
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,980
have spent a lot of effort solving that

318
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,750
problem trying to make it as real time

319
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,790
as possible so what they do is they'll

320
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,850
use google talk or msn messenger and let

321
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,170
Google and Microsoft handle the

322
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,790
difficult engineering parts of it and

323
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,460
they'll just abuse that to their benefit

324
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,810
there's also a lot of academic papers

325
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,640
where researchers have been looking at

326
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,200
how Twitter might be used as a command

327
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,250
and control channel and also this isn't

328
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,770
just the desktop problem there's a lot

329
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:44,130
of mobile malware for instance using a

330
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,530
push notification services baidu cloud

331
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,870
push or Google Cloud messaging where

332
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,360
again keeping a network connection open

333
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,640
to your roaming mobile devices it's a

334
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,650
difficult engineering challenge but push

335
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,930
notification services try and solve that

336
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,510
problem so why not benefit from that use

337
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,180
use push notification services to push

338
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,020
the commands to the two

339
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,090
mobile devices and then those mobile

340
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:11,350
devices can reply again now there's also

341
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,140
cases where it's not the primary channel

342
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,870
but if the primary C&C doesn't respond

343
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,480
the malware might might use or fall back

344
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,840
to a backup channel that is based on a

345
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,900
third-party service for instance there's

346
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,940
case like onion Duke which if it's

347
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,530
unable to connect to its primary command

348
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,480
and control server it will look for

349
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,600
tweets from specific Twitter accounts to

350
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,970
look for links in those tweets and the

351
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,940
links will lead to nice images like this

352
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,150
publicly available desktop wallpaper

353
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,740
except at the end of the file there's a

354
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,200
there's a identifier and then there's a

355
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,570
ascii hexadecimal string and when that's

356
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,570
converted to binary and decoder with

357
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,880
exhort key you suddenly have a new new

358
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,760
binary or a people new version of onion

359
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,430
duke and it will run that and again

360
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,520
there are lots of other examples as well

361
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,010
well using a variety of different

362
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:09,460
services for this things like cozy Duke

363
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,100
or flashback which both use Twitter as a

364
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,150
backup mechanism as well or a

365
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,610
downloaders nymphs used tumblr and in

366
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,810
some of these cases it will be a

367
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,610
hard-coded Twitter account for instance

368
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,440
but in many cases they'll actually

369
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,690
they'll have a kind of a DGA algorithm

370
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,420
they'll they'll generate a account name

371
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,340
based on the current date and look at

372
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,340
that so it's 11 form of the main

373
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,850
generation algorithm so kind of ported

374
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,580
to this this sort of methods there's one

375
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,150
more use case I'd like to touch upon

376
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,860
which is third party services for

377
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,490
exfiltration where large amounts of data

378
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:52,930
going out of a network is especially if

379
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,230
it's going to an unknown or a not a not

380
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,150
a well-known service it's quite

381
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,170
suspicious but what if it's what if that

382
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,030
data is going to Microsoft onedrive or

383
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,130
Dropbox or some common file sharing

384
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,959
service it's suddenly a lot less

385
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:10,240
suspicious because those services people

386
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,849
use for precisely the purpose of

387
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:15,339
uploading data there and for instance a

388
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:18,640
cozy dear can hammer you both they have

389
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,369
our means of communicating with the

390
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:24,010
command and control server but once the

391
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,450
attackers decide they want to start

392
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,130
exfiltrating data they've decided what

393
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,200
data they want to steal they'll actually

394
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,650
use Microsoft onedrive and transfer the

395
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,050
data due to onedrive instead of over the

396
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:39,580
primary command and control protocol so

397
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,940
quick recap there's a variety of use

398
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,460
cases or ways of abusing third party

399
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,770
services simple things like proxying or

400
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,200
just to help establish a primary cnc

401
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,690
channel but also as various kinds of

402
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,640
command and control channels primary or

403
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,890
backup or as an exfiltration channel for

404
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,000
instance and of course all kinds of

405
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,540
combinations of the bubble and if you're

406
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,460
interested there's a lot more examples

407
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,120
and links in the paper so do go and read

408
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,070
through those as well lots of

409
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,930
interesting cases that have been

410
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:15,370
documented over the years but despite

411
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,520
all of these challenges not to get too

412
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,500
depressed there's also a lot of

413
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,370
opportunities new new things that we can

414
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,860
actually do or benefit from this for

415
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,820
instance we can't sink hole and we can't

416
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,640
do take down sort of forensic dumps of

417
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,170
command and control servers so it's

418
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:38,800
harder to get data on who the victims

419
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,020
are or how many victims there are so we

420
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,060
can't monitor that but we can more into

421
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,740
the attackers because sounds like

422
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,440
Twitter for instance it's public so we

423
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,960
can just go in and look at the tweets

424
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,960
there plus compared to a case where the

425
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,410
malware or the attackers operate the C&C

426
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,750
server themselves they can if they're

427
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,550
good or if they're careful they look at

428
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,200
the logs and try and see if if

429
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,300
researchers start poking at their

430
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,210
servers but if the service is sounds

431
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,850
like Twitter they don't see that so they

432
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,350
don't know they're being monitored they

433
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,910
don't know they were being watched which

434
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:16,870
is a big benefit for us and so it allows

435
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,350
us to track them a lot easier because we

436
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,820
can basically passively monitor them

437
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,430
instead of actively poking at their

438
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,480
infrastructure for instance and other

439
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,730
similar opportunities statistics that a

440
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,470
lot of services actual

441
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,960
make publicly available things like in

442
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,669
this case it's a Yanni clubbed I

443
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:38,320
mentioned earlier which used YouTube

444
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,470
comments I will YouTube make shows you

445
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,539
how many views the video has had and how

446
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:45,760
that's evolved over time and so you can

447
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,470
try and use that to estimate how many

448
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,059
victims there might actually be and

449
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:51,400
these are open the available statistics

450
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,559
that you can just browse on a YouTube

451
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,100
for instance and a similar opportunity

452
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,320
is also related to the historical

453
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:07,169
research and this is a quote from a

454
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:13,690
semantics blog post they they they talk

455
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,390
about a Trojan Trojan groups that or

456
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,159
that's what they call it the Trojan that

457
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,140
uses google news groups as its command

458
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,150
and control server so the malware will

459
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,480
post a new new message to the news group

460
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,549
and then the attackers might reply with

461
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:29,650
new commands and then in this case there

462
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:32,169
was also a kind of a constant posting

463
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:35,409
that that had commands for initial

464
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:38,440
commands for the malware and as semantic

465
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,409
notes in the in the blog post all of

466
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:43,299
those postings are stored there so they

467
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:44,980
were able to go back and read through

468
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,070
all of the or of the connections from

469
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,539
all the different malware look at look

470
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,730
at all of the all of the information

471
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,740
that took different victims or malware

472
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,500
from lifting different victims that are

473
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,309
posted there and even more usefully

474
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:01,600
google news groups for rights version

475
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,240
control so they were able to go back and

476
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,590
look at how the commands had changed

477
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,960
over time and how the attackers had had

478
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,809
modified those and in this case as well

479
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:13,059
google news groups also provide

480
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:16,480
statistics for for the public to see so

481
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,760
again they were able to use that as well

482
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,610
to try and go to how many victims there

483
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,350
might be or how big of a problem this

484
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,190
might be so again it's a different kind

485
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,169
of opportunity something that hasn't

486
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:33,100
been as as possible with wit or isn't as

487
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,409
possible with more traditional cases of

488
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:37,330
command and control servers operated by

489
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,130
the attackers where if they're good or

490
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,380
if they're smart they'll clean up after

491
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,880
themselves and once you get the forensic

492
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,130
dump there's actually not that much

493
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,330
historical data for you

494
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,470
you collect there's also a one more

495
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,100
opportunity one that are I like to call

496
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,649
a god mode which is a interesting case

497
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:02,590
where these service providers they have

498
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,659
amazing visibility into their services

499
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:07,750
and sometimes they can use that to their

500
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,740
advantage for instance there's a quote

501
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,590
from report by blue coat on what they

502
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,870
call the inception framework also known

503
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,779
as cloud atlas where the malware would

504
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:22,600
use a file sharing service or cloud

505
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,450
cloud storage provider cloud me as as

506
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,700
the command and control channel and once

507
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,010
the researchers started working with the

508
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,679
service provider they notified them that

509
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:34,330
we've seen this malicious activity and

510
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,159
we've seen that this account is being

511
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,610
used to channel commands from malware

512
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,860
cloud me actually went through their log

513
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,980
data and they were able to identify over

514
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,070
100 other accounts that seem to be

515
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,350
related so they were able to use all of

516
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,360
the visibility they have into their

517
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,389
services into their there are activities

518
00:22:55,389 --> 00:22:58,029
and use that to help researchers so

519
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:00,549
again there are a lot of opportunities

520
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:03,130
if you get to color or you get the

521
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,139
service providers to collaborate you can

522
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:07,149
actually gain a lot more than might be

523
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:09,820
possible with just getting NetFlow data

524
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,250
for a hosted server or getting a

525
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,130
forensic dump which is it's just a

526
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,299
snapshot and you have no way of knowing

527
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:18,429
whether right next door there's another

528
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:20,139
or you know in the same hosting provider

529
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:22,149
there's actually another other server on

530
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:24,820
a closed IP address but you have no idea

531
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,010
no way of identifying that or not as

532
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,409
easily where whereas in this case it was

533
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,360
a apparently surprisingly easy to

534
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:37,000
identify a lot of related cases so there

535
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,279
are challenges cases or things that

536
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,019
we're used to doing or techniques we're

537
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:47,710
used to using that don't work anymore or

538
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,510
might not work the same way things like

539
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,250
take dance or sing calling for instance

540
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,760
especially takedowns where it it's it's

541
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,470
different from what what it is with

542
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,940
traditional mechanisms it's still

543
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,130
possible by in different ways

544
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,110
some cases like the network level

545
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,690
detection and blocking or also for

546
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,610
incident response where you lose a lot

547
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,170
of the visibility or all of the

548
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,840
visibility in some cases but there's

549
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,830
also opportunities for easier monitoring

550
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,680
of the attackers more statistics more

551
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,690
more historical data even in some cases

552
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:27,900
god mode which which also helps a lot so

553
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,650
in conclusion like I mentioned for in

554
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:35,260
the oldest examples I've shown are from

555
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:40,030
2009 and those certainly or I'm certain

556
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,830
they went the first times that someone

557
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,630
suddenly thought of this so it's not a

558
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,660
new thing it's been going on for a while

559
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:50,140
but it it hasn't caught on yet it's not

560
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,820
become a big thing yet and so it's not

561
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,830
become a big problem either there are

562
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:57,370
already a lot of targeted attacks for

563
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,900
instance or malware used in targeted

564
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,030
attacks that do do this type of stuff

565
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,130
that abuse third party services for

566
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,190
commander control channels but it's not

567
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:09,870
caught on yet it brings new challenges

568
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,600
but it also brings new opportunities and

569
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,430
again it's not a case of all hope is

570
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,150
lost now it's it's more a case of

571
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,470
understanding that which techniques

572
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,420
won't work and finding replacements

573
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,980
finding other methods of accomplishing

574
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,620
similar things and it's definitely

575
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,480
something that should be taken into

576
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,340
account when designing defenses whether

577
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,800
if you're defending a specific Network

578
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,220
for instance thinking of what if the

579
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,950
malware for instance what if the malware

580
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,920
uses third party services how do you

581
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,320
find all of the infected hosts in your

582
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,000
network but also if you're designing

583
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,300
tools to help others protect again how

584
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,060
do you work around the problem of losing

585
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:55,390
this type of disability and and for

586
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,400
instance in this case you lose a lot of

587
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,200
visibility on the network but on the

588
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,630
endpoints for instance it's not such a

589
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,430
big problem so on the endpoints if you

590
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,550
if you see explorer.exe for instance

591
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,500
connecting to facebook that that's

592
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,480
probably still suspicious but the

593
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,730
network you don't know them and I think

594
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,080
this is something that

595
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,029
deserves more attention deserves more

596
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:17,320
research there's probably a lot more

597
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,419
that could be done to detect this type

598
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:20,769
of stuff we just have to find that out

599
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:23,830
things like Sebastian Garcia's talk on

600
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,870
Wednesday of new ways of identifying

601
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:28,779
malicious network activity for instance

602
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:32,919
or or improved techniques on endpoint

603
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:34,690
things like that where we might be able

604
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,340
to work around these problems so

605
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,559
hopefully I've got a new thinking about

606
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,390
these types of things and hopefully we

607
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,240
can come up with new solutions new new

608
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,440
ways of working around some of the

609
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,029
challenges and new ways of using these

610
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:51,299
opportunities to our advantage thank you

611
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:57,820
ok thank you very much aftereing I think

612
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,529
we have some time for questions does

613
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:02,409
anyone have questions for all right wait

614
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:06,059
for the microphone please there you go

615
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:09,970
its more common than a question I love

616
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:12,610
what you said requires you as a defender

617
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:15,460
to look inside in an outgoing encrypted

618
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,820
traffic and when it comes to inspecting

619
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,340
SSL i would like to since some of the

620
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,419
people in the room might be in a

621
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:24,130
position and have products that do that

622
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,740
i'd like to call attention to talk from

623
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,740
the CCC camp back in august by german

624
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,169
guy handle the talk was called SSL

625
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:34,179
inspection is considered harmful you

626
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:37,960
should check it out thank you very a

627
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,690
comment any questions from the room oh

628
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,029
yeah there's one more question yep so

629
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:49,950
say that I'm a service slip service

630
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,980
provider and somebody's using me for

631
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:58,000
this CNC stuff what is my liability I

632
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,179
mean how much leverage do we have in

633
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,789
those folks so that they cooperate

634
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:09,010
provide the data I'm not a lawyer so so

635
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,740
don't don't don't base your decisions on

636
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,409
this but my understanding or from

637
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:16,090
looking at cases where this has happened

638
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,950
the service providers are usually happy

639
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:21,190
to cooperate it's more down to they'll

640
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,559
take down their accounts at that that's

641
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:25,750
usually a given but then how much data

642
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,100
there for instance they might be willing

643
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,000
to provide to you

644
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,380
that depends a lot on their privacy

645
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,820
policies enable us and all of that

646
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,800
related to their customers so that

647
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,650
that's or sometimes or often a challenge

648
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,320
but then there's some fly cloud me for

649
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,880
instance which apparently was very happy

650
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,580
to collaborate and their CEO turned it

651
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,740
into a nice PR speech because you're

652
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,930
saying our service is so trustworthy and

653
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,200
so so good that even that bad guys want

654
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,450
to use our service so they used it as a

655
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:57,400
marketing trick as well excellent and do

656
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,880
we have time for one more question no

657
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,740
okay thank you very much artery thanks
