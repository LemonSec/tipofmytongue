1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,980
okay our next speaker for this

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,930
afternoon's session is ova bilodeaux

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,660
works for ESET canada and it's going to

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,460
share some interesting research on home

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,110
routers and how you can build a botnet

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,960
on these devices levere stage is yours

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,180
thank you hi everyone alright so Linux

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,070
moves and then Droid or instinct an

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,099
update on this strange button today's

10
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,189
agenda is I'll talk about the challenges

11
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:31,859
of analyzing statically linked strip elf

12
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,460
channel binaries thanks to the avast

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,710
presentation yesterday some of the elf

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,480
file format will not be explained I'll

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,899
be able to go straight into the details

16
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,320
will address the moves DNA moves hurting

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,030
funny names to say description and

18
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,969
operation and then why in our eyes it's

19
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,160
a strange animal and also address the

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,309
latest developments so this presentation

21
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,050
will have a lot of rhythm especially

22
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,730
since I had to reboot and last a few

23
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,680
minutes and i also have a lot of ground

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,890
to cover so let's start right away let's

25
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,710
just skip who am i but i work at ESET i

26
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,180
guess is enough for people here so the

27
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,630
static and strip elf binary challenge is

28
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,049
that in elf code which is has these

29
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,270
properties it there there are no imports

30
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,330
so no library calls present all of the

31
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,310
code is packaged together down to this

32
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,070
Colonel system call level so there is a

33
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,790
lot of code did I disassembler even on

34
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,560
the architecture that it works for

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,200
example x86 or arm if you have enough

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,619
money you will get a lot of pieces of

37
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,579
code which are all relative and all down

38
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,799
to the siskel again so you have to go

39
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,840
through a lot of code in order to just

40
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,790
get a sense of what the malware is doing

41
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,530
just to give you a like image of this

42
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,229
complexity this is Linux moves inside of

43
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,240
either I took three screenshots of three

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,860
functions so three full pages of

45
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,530
functions and we are only at 33 lines

46
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,680
shown in these three pages out of 500

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,139
lines of functions to analyze all of

48
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,959
this without any symbols so let's look

49
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,670
for exam

50
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,880
at a printf family of course so a printf

51
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,360
and the proximity view is all linked

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,650
these function linked together and

53
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,110
calling internally the V printf function

54
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,099
so the VF printf internal this if we

55
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:30,260
explode this view and get the proximity

56
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,660
view of all of the VF printf family we

57
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,730
get this but this is all the proximity

58
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,739
view so we're not still at the assembly

59
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,319
language level so it into need to get an

60
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,670
understanding of what reverse

61
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,010
engineering VF printf before you realize

62
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,410
that you are in printf code means we

63
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,380
have to go deeper how bad is this it

64
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,350
looks like this so this is only the VF

65
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,840
printf function in which there is not a

66
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,090
single system call so you're still not

67
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,950
sure if you are printing anything to

68
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,500
screen or not when you look at it you

69
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,380
have to figure it out the ecosystem is

70
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,049
also making everything worse because GCC

71
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:08,510
and lipsy are always changing versions

72
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,090
updating and when it is statically

73
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,940
linked all of that code is in line into

74
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,109
the elf binary so you need to you cannot

75
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:20,570
build a database of this of this

76
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,019
knowledge and reuse it from time to time

77
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:25,910
because of that problem either flirt

78
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,640
signatures are rarely available and form

79
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,400
the Linux moves case nothing was

80
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,760
available additionally you don't only

81
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,799
have the new lipsy which is used in

82
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,079
embedded system malware you have you see

83
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,940
lipsy which is the case of linux moose

84
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,209
you have EG lipsy gypsy and muscle so a

85
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,220
lot of c libraries available to the cat

86
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,040
and to try to identify before you can

87
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,100
start looking at the maori code the

88
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,570
first failed attempt when trying to

89
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,299
analyze moose was to map syscalls with

90
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:59,420
an either script that would document the

91
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,970
function that was doing the cisco but

92
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,950
even then as you saw in the printf case

93
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,440
it's still too much code to analyze with

94
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,260
this strategy the lipsy is just too big

95
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,739
and it's too much work so what we've

96
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:14,720
been able to do is instead and this is

97
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,978
the advice part of the elf challenge we

98
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:20,358
reproduce the exact environment

99
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:23,860
architecture lipsy compiler versions

100
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,210
luckily we had the

101
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,539
Zack open wrt revision that was used to

102
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:32,180
compile Linux moves in the strings so we

103
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,220
were able to check out the exact version

104
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,800
and the exact build environment with

105
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,599
this we built libraries with symbol

106
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:40,699
under the same conditions and then you

107
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:43,849
spin this to map the library function so

108
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:46,160
we were able to then focus only on the

109
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,300
malware code as an example this is what

110
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,639
we were able to do with with this

111
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,310
strategy so all of the unknown code on

112
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,690
the left hand side and then all the

113
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,460
names and the symbols loaded on the

114
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,620
right hand side you select all of these

115
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,320
lines with the confidence that you are

116
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,630
ready to work with and then you import

117
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,120
all the symbols into your ID be and so

118
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,400
from there you can then focus on the

119
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,530
unknown functions and I try to identify

120
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,810
what they are calling and then move on

121
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,710
from there in the linux moose case we

122
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,979
were able to map this way 225 functions

123
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:24,590
out of the 500 so this is really helping

124
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,780
there's a lot of rapper functions also

125
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,699
so it eliminates another bunch of

126
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:32,380
functions because of the simple wrapping

127
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,320
moving out to Moose DNA since we've

128
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,449
given all of this information already in

129
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:40,070
a report and i guess some of you might

130
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,190
have read it i will go really quickly

131
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,740
through the this the analysis and try to

132
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,440
focus on the later part of the talk but

133
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,229
still so that everyone understand what

134
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:53,780
we're talking about will also describe

135
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,570
it so the next moose was named after a

136
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,479
string ella present and a malware

137
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,880
executable right here Ellen do in Ottawa

138
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,440
which was the file that was the download

139
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,690
them our was downloaded as before being

140
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,449
executed so ella is being a

141
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:14,150
french-canadian speaking for me was

142
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,680
familiar with a moose french canadian

143
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,659
moose if you want or not french but

144
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:23,120
anyway can add a moose but after the

145
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,039
release of the white pepper thanks to

146
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,380
internet crowdsourcing we got other

147
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,599
reason for the names so maybe they were

148
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:31,490
into cars after all and they were

149
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,729
nostalgic of the great load Susilo or

150
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,639
maybe they're from around here and they

151
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,210
it's based on earth

152
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,979
back rock band from the nineteen

153
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,500
sixty-nine that is still alive called

154
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,160
Ella so thanks Robert lapufsky for this

155
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,319
tip I didn't know about that band

156
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,990
unfortunately so moving on to the

157
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,810
Moose's network capabilities what it

158
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,910
does that was really interesting for us

159
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,979
was it was able to pivot through

160
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,370
firewalls via infected routers so which

161
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,770
means that it can scan internal network

162
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,590
and is aware of its position is if its

163
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,900
internet reachable or not and will

164
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,110
address this behavior it carries home

165
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,690
main net reversal code also has a

166
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,120
custom-made proxy service the proxy

167
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,400
service interestingly is listening on a

168
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,050
specific port and understand report

169
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:29,190
10,000 and 73 this proxy service can

170
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,889
only be activated by a specific white

171
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:35,310
list of IP addresses that are sent in

172
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,520
the cincy configuration and the initial

173
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,139
fetch of the configuration and then

174
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:45,090
after every hour of the malware this the

175
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,009
reason I insist on this mechanism is

176
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,630
that I will get back to it because it

177
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,400
prevented us to do some prevalence

178
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,280
important programs information it also

179
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,080
has a remotely configured generic

180
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,659
network sniffer so it can it sniffed a

181
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:00,690
simple loop on on the raw socket to get

182
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,310
all the packets and do some pattern

183
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,740
matching and has DNS hijacking

184
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,009
capabilities that are targeting specific

185
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:12,389
device tp-link sitel stuff like that it

186
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:14,699
has worm-like behavior so it tries to

187
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,830
replicate via aggressive scanning using

188
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,520
up to 36 threads son on the lam some on

189
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,889
the one someone close eye peas some on

190
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:25,650
further I piece it will dedicate more

191
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,590
threads to try to find a public IPS that

192
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,229
are closed by its own IP which is an

193
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:32,760
interesting behavior knowing how

194
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,380
firewall rules are complex and how

195
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,779
mistakes happen in firewalls which makes

196
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,559
sense for them unfortunately not for us

197
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,020
we'll scan online I said it it will not

198
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,000
reinfect an infected device it can

199
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,430
replicate across architectures so a mips

200
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,949
router can infect an armed router you'll

201
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:52,560
see why later and this CNC is made

202
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,350
aware of new compromises so just quickly

203
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,220
again this is each line is like possible

204
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,990
threads that are launched on all of

205
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,360
these interfaces the compromised

206
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,000
protocol involves the CNC which is

207
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,920
active during compromise so the

208
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,690
advantages of this approach is that it

209
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,870
can get gather a specific binary for

210
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,210
each architecture and we will not expose

211
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,910
the other binaries to the to the Maori

212
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,950
analyst it's not all downloaded at the

213
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,350
same time it's fetched on purpose on

214
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,710
infection it can gather additional data

215
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,630
when it's trying to infect and send to

216
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,390
the CNC so the CNC can be aware of maybe

217
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,870
potentially new architectures and or

218
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,310
environments where it could target and

219
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,430
you a new binary new malware the

220
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,500
disadvantage is that if the CNC is down

221
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,260
no further compromises happen it is

222
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,360
absolutely needs to be involved in the

223
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,020
infection process a prey it spreads by

224
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,060
finding routers with weak or default

225
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,710
credentials something that is very

226
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,220
common in the IOT space and only the

227
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,820
italianate protocol no ssh you it

228
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,640
carries some anti analysis so the

229
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,520
statically linked is part that I

230
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,230
mentioned earlier while not being an

231
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,030
active measure of anti analysis it's

232
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,940
still making the reverse engineering job

233
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,080
really tedious so a lot more work is

234
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,970
required then if the symbols we will be

235
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,250
there which is something we see for most

236
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,230
nutmouse but a lot of other embedded

237
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,600
threats the environment is hard to

238
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,589
reproduce because you need to be

239
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:27,480
reachable from the internet in order to

240
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,190
get interesting payloads in your honey

241
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,860
pot if you are netted you will get

242
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,750
payloads eventually but it will take a

243
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,720
long time before doing so and they are

244
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,300
misleading strings also in the the

245
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,089
binary the one of them get cool was

246
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:46,260
actually taken down by a researcher who

247
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,030
thought it was related to the campaign

248
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,190
but didn't totally reverse-engineer the

249
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,080
code so he asked for the domain to be

250
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,420
taken down but the domain had nothing to

251
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,190
do with the malware operation it was

252
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,430
just a host header put there to confuse

253
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,470
people so you need to be careful

254
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,890
sometimes so in a nutshell this is all

255
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,390
of the things I've just described

256
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,100
put it a nice diagram with a kind of

257
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,630
Ashima of when things are important but

258
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,750
let's move move right away so the

259
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,790
operation now so what we have is a

260
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,100
malware which can have a remotely

261
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,560
configure sniffer so broad espionage and

262
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,360
infiltration capability can traverse

263
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,180
firewall what did they use it for well

264
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,940
unfortunately it was stealing cookies

265
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,270
that are already protected by HTTPS most

266
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,830
of the time so social network cookies so

267
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,300
the effectiveness is definitely

268
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,180
debatable when we did analyze the proxy

269
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,820
usage in honey pot for over a month we

270
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,530
determine the natural traffic the

271
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,240
protocol and the targeted social

272
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,450
networks and here are the numbers so in

273
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,850
blue you have the so this is like the

274
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,320
nature of the traffic so when do you

275
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,330
have social network traffic which is

276
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,610
most of the of websites used and in

277
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,560
yellow you have the button meta traffic

278
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,170
it's using it to try to find what it is

279
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,320
own public IP address so most of it was

280
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,650
for social network not even private VPN

281
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,040
or practicing for the malware operator

282
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,010
if we look down at the protocols used in

283
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,960
the in that traffic we find out that

284
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,720
more than 75 percent is HTTPS which

285
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,510
means that for us the peak apps are more

286
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,600
or less useless for at least https

287
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,780
whereas CPS is concerned but HTTPS has a

288
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,090
great property you have a common name in

289
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,160
the certificate which is exchanged

290
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,170
during the handshake SSL handshake so

291
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,970
we're able to identify with high

292
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,510
precision who was targeted because even

293
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:49,170
if the IP was hosted on Amazon ec2 we

294
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,810
had the certificate going through so we

295
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,910
knew okay it's also the ec2 but it is

296
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,700
and stir Instagram so let's look at

297
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,270
these numbers most of the targeting was

298
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,090
on Twitter vine a lot of Instagram

299
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,240
traffic and some others in the other

300
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,990
section you have YouTube Yandex yahoo

301
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,420
and Amazon Cloud and also soundcloud was

302
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,760
in there so most of these sites if you

303
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,040
google you can find that you can buy

304
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,200
views likes

305
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:26,190
listens or followers on internet so we

306
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,680
think because it's a GPS we are not a

307
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,630
hundred percent confident but we think

308
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,790
that this button was used to do so and

309
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,550
was leveraging the good IP reputation of

310
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,240
all the dsl home routers to leverage

311
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,460
this good IP reputation to do this type

312
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,910
of fraud so it was more than 75

313
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,360
percentage gps but in some cases like

314
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,280
this case here the first connection is

315
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,760
an HTTP and then upgraded to https so in

316
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,970
number one you see the socks proxy

317
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,800
requests and hack which is a very simple

318
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,230
protocol then the data is going through

319
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,500
the infected machine and in number two

320
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,350
you see so they get at the top is an

321
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,880
HTTP but right away the HTTP header that

322
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,010
is sent back is a location redirect

323
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,250
header to upgrading to https so what we

324
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,290
did with the HTTP is we decided to look

325
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,890
at what was the user doing look at their

326
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,440
profile so we saw some user starts with

327
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,130
little following little accounts close

328
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,580
to zero and we saw them upgrade or

329
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,760
increase through time mostly within a

330
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,000
day to let's say maximum 50 followers so

331
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,030
in this case 36 after a few hours then

332
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,650
we started looking okay who are they

333
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,860
following most of it is internal

334
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,990
following so following each other to

335
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,150
make kind of a network graph of all the

336
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,170
fake accounts but then in a few of them

337
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,420
you can spot other things like in this

338
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,090
case here singing which means which is a

339
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,790
business so we looked at the account and

340
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,580
if it seems legit or not and we realized

341
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,850
that it was following a few people and

342
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,400
had really few posts to be credible a

343
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,370
credible account of 3,000 followers

344
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,770
considering that it had no Google

345
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,920
presence at all so it's not a web

346
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,850
present business so we look at that

347
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,100
number we were probably late already in

348
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,370
the purchase and we

349
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,490
a week after and it went up to 11 k

350
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,730
followers so after a week so we think

351
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,190
that by doing this little you know

352
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:40,240
looking around the data that this makes

353
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,460
a case for the the use of the but

354
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,100
Annette related to a social network

355
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:51,130
fraud then the operation also had were

356
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,779
doing things that were preventing us to

357
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:55,660
do proper tracking the whitelist meant

358
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,360
the white list of IP address meant that

359
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,520
we couldn't fingerprint the proxy

360
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,500
service from any IP on the internet

361
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,779
otherwise we would have scanned the

362
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:07,150
whole internet using the rapid seven

363
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,089
guys and they heard the annales

364
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:11,920
collaboration and service and try to do

365
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,690
the proper handshake for the proxy and

366
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,900
then list all of the public IPS which

367
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,640
would have responded properly to the

368
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,560
proxy handshake which would have given

369
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,740
us exact prevalence number of internet

370
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,500
reachable infected hosts but of course

371
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,630
the whitelist true that all the way we

372
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,270
couldn't do that so we were blind

373
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,610
because of HTTPS and forced on social

374
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,190
network and lack of collaboration with

375
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,830
the major social network sites we sent p

376
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:43,660
caps we asked for some tips some help on

377
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,339
their side but they were not interested

378
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:49,510
and the DNS hijacking that I mentioned

379
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,550
earlier the rogue DNS server are never

380
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,700
really revealed again because the CNC is

381
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,620
involved in the infection so we're not

382
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,350
able to get the dns IP address if we'd

383
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,800
have been able to get them we could have

384
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,929
fingerprinted wet phishing site or wet

385
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:06,550
domains were they after where they were

386
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,400
interested in by comparing results on

387
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,260
DNS query on these servers with normal

388
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,470
DNS servers so in a nutshell what we

389
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,720
have in this operation again the

390
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,339
individual malware always trying to

391
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:22,119
spread and do this do its bidding steaua

392
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,400
stealing cookies social network fraud

393
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,760
and then focus also on reproduction so

394
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,450
why do I say it's a strange animal so

395
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,490
it's not in the Dida's or Bitcoin mining

396
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,280
business for an embedded threat which is

397
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,330
rarity in itself there is no x86 variant

398
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,840
found so we found MIPS arm two flavors

399
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,700
of arm and big and the end little engine

400
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,410
of all the architectures that supports

401
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,200
it and it seems controlled by a single

402
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,060
group of actors because it's all hard

403
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:56,110
coded IP is one server so not something

404
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,280
that what the source code is available

405
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,040
and everyone would compile each in their

406
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,070
own site some missing features that are

407
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,710
really strange no persistent mechanism

408
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,190
at all no shell access for the operator

409
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,930
so this is again something that we're

410
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,730
not used to see but since they had

411
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,250
access to the router already through

412
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,350
week or default credentials they can

413
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,330
still anyway investigate if it's

414
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,820
publicly accessible so it's not a big

415
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,870
deal i guess so we're thinking that this

416
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,180
thing thought big but realized little so

417
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,060
the the network sniffer is mostly

418
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,490
irrelevant in the context of every sites

419
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,130
using HTTPS right now and but it could

420
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,590
have been used for you know maybe more

421
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,070
espionage type activities also the DNS

422
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,020
hijacking is possible but only used for

423
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,940
very few devices and we were never able

424
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,040
to trigger it to see it in action again

425
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,140
it could have done with a good IP

426
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,870
reputation of the victims it could have

427
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,480
done add fraud spam Dida's or just

428
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,330
generic VPN services but it didn't do

429
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,540
any of that if we look at the latest

430
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,060
developments of the move since the paper

431
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,370
of the release so after the publication

432
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,180
the CNC servers went dark we were in

433
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,780
that time frame actively contacting the

434
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,900
hosts and trying to have you know get

435
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,210
hold of the IP addresses or get them to

436
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,220
react they were saying it was

437
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,140
compromised server so we wanted to help

438
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,730
with the compromise over to have the

439
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,860
server side parts server side binaries

440
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:32,730
if any and so that all that discussion

441
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,820
finished unanswered after a reboot like

442
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,950
I said earlier not nothing would be

443
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,570
infected anymore because of the lack of

444
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,910
a persistent mechanism which means that

445
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,040
you know when your water starts to

446
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,029
misbehave you just rebooted and oh I my

447
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:50,279
internet was not working well before I

448
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:52,499
reboot now everything's fine you still

449
00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:54,210
have a binary with malware on your

450
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,969
router's file system but you never have

451
00:19:56,969 --> 00:19:58,619
a shell on your own router so you don't

452
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:01,019
and you can't investigate yourself most

453
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:03,840
of the time victims were compromised we

454
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,279
have we credentials so they can always

455
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:07,320
reinfect from another C&C server from

456
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,599
anywhere else and then bootstrap another

457
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,619
but net so we started looking at sans

458
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:15,899
internet probe data to see if we did

459
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:18,659
have an impact and this is the port ten

460
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:20,219
thousand and seventy-three activity and

461
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,960
the red arrow represents when we

462
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,710
released our paper so again being

463
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,330
non-scientific I have to admit you know

464
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,799
this is just a data like like this we

465
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,349
have what we can have and that's it but

466
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:38,429
still there is the things vanishes you

467
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:40,889
know and it's around where the CNC

468
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:43,109
servers stopped existing and then one

469
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,149
reboot and no more scanning of the

470
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:47,820
internet by your router so it seems like

471
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:53,399
we had an impact so because of this the

472
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:55,200
fact that the button had disappeared we

473
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,820
started being on the lookout for the

474
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,799
next version of moose so I looked at

475
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,169
over during the summer over 150 new

476
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:02,789
samples targeting embedded Linux

477
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:06,330
platforms as they were as FS we're

478
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,309
describing yesterday I went through a

479
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,429
lot of agri the flu dns amp gasps get

480
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:14,999
tsunami and whatever are naming you know

481
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:18,089
when even in our own it's all like

482
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:20,489
source code leaked and modifications and

483
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:23,729
so it's really a mess dynamic the

484
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:25,499
nomenclature in this space right now

485
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:28,169
still no moves update so we popped up

486
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:29,999
the champagne and started to celebrate

487
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:33,239
but of course anything can happen to

488
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:37,529
mess with your talk so saturday mousse

489
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,499
level up our beloved peter kushina found

490
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,950
some a pneumo sample and update gun

491
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,469
knows where he found it but it was moose

492
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:50,669
and so started digging into it a new

493
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:53,369
proxy service port so this is why the

494
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:56,700
data from the 10,000 seventh report was

495
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,639
not relevant anymore you see NC

496
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:01,100
selection algorithm

497
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,840
and it's tricky we were not able to

498
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,150
still find it so they knew that this was

499
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,580
a weak point in their previous malware

500
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,919
and they probably adapted it and a lot

501
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,110
of differences so been the thing with my

502
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:15,770
previous my best idb if you want is

503
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,650
really yielding bad results because it's

504
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,660
compiled with different compilers will

505
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,510
have to go through this whole static

506
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,760
analysis again and we're still looking

507
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,950
at it and we are careful we don't want

508
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,020
to rely on strings with hostname and ask

509
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,270
take down on these domains so we take

510
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:35,000
our time on this one so let's look at

511
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,039
this 20 and 0 12 port activity aha so we

512
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:41,720
have something that was dead and then

513
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,030
something taking off let's compare when

514
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,510
the paper was it was released oh so it

515
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,370
looks like it's just to mess up with my

516
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,710
visit my vb talk that they released a

517
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,780
new update or something like that anyway

518
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,429
so we think we have in our hands a new

519
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:00,320
version we can't wait to find the new

520
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,030
C&C server and hope that the hosting

521
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,830
providers will collaborate so we can

522
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,240
gather more information on the server

523
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,840
side components and and maybe kill this

524
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,770
thread again in conclusion embedded

525
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,470
malware is a different beast in my

526
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,950
opinion it's not yet complex so there's

527
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,820
no packer or it's only upx it's not as

528
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,070
advanced as the windows a counterpart

529
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,250
but the tools and the visibility the

530
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,850
telemetry and the processes that we have

531
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,470
will need to be improved because it's

532
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,179
taking a while and still a lot of work

533
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:38,059
especially on prevalence information we

534
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:42,080
have a lot of things to try right now

535
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,210
it's a low-hanging fruit not the malware

536
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,610
but the routers and the IOT industry I'm

537
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,830
not talking about how we're being the

538
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,380
low-hanging fruit so them our operators

539
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,210
is normal that they go after the least

540
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,159
effort the path of least resistance and

541
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:59,390
this is why they are all up on embedded

542
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:02,059
devices where we don't run AV and where

543
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:04,190
we have no visibility and we don't even

544
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,559
realize is infected in the case of linux

545
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,870
moose I mean that network impact is

546
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,600
minimal so what you can do is lose some

547
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,640
IP reputation but the ISPs I don't

548
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,540
really care

549
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,280
targeted social networks don't really

550
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,550
care so I mean you don't even realize

551
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,300
you're infected and prevention is simple

552
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,180
so in this case prevention is as simple

553
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,890
as changing your default username and

554
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,040
passwords which is like pretty easy just

555
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,930
for a strong one not for password with a

556
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,950
zero of course but this is again until

557
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,080
there's a new shell shock which goes out

558
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,660
and targets all the routers which would

559
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,360
then be able to affect all of the

560
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,730
ecosystem again and these guys will

561
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,940
adapt and half done not the most

562
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,680
specifically but the other embedded but

563
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,630
Annette they do adapt to vulnerabilities

564
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,300
and as the last piece of advice I would

565
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,550
say friends don't let friends run

566
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,680
routers with default credentials so

567
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,230
before all our antivirus product have

568
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,070
built in a weak password detection as we

569
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,200
saw this morning is coming up for quite

570
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,080
nicely for avast i would say when you

571
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,110
get to a friend's house just hit the 19

572
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,680
200 6811 try n min if it's working then

573
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,710
tell them or change it for them and if

574
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,410
we have all of us if we have enough

575
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,990
friends then maybe we'll fix this

576
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:30,470
problem a little so i think i have some

577
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,090
time for questions thank you for your

578
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,629
attention

579
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,410
and this we definitely can take a couple

580
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:51,540
of questions everyone quiet okay Nick

581
00:25:54,390 --> 00:26:04,260
can you hear me Oh to get affected the

582
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,580
vulnerable machines have Devlin

583
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,610
administration poor open on the way

584
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,790
inside right why why for this great

585
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:16,030
machines manufacturers still even making

586
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:19,809
it a frigging option I think like so

587
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:23,590
what we saw was mostly affected were ISP

588
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,020
provision device and i think that the

589
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:30,100
isp enables the one access to managed

590
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,830
remotely so in one case i have in mind

591
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,429
it was dsl but not like a router with

592
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:40,630
antennas but just the dsl modem and so

593
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,760
for management purposes they were using

594
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,250
telnet from the one side to manage the

595
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,500
routers of course they changed firewall

596
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,140
configuration heavily to seal this from

597
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,230
the internet but as soon as one was

598
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,360
infected because of the of the nature of

599
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,220
the scan which favored local IP

600
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,440
addresses it was not crossing the

601
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,510
firewalls boundary and so reinfection

602
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,669
would would be happening all the time

603
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:06,429
until we told them how it was operating

604
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:08,110
and any other they understood why it had

605
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,559
so much problem getting rid of this

606
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,750
thanks but yeah of course management

607
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,600
anything open from the one side is

608
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,970
definitely a bad idea and i guess most

609
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:23,650
of the most of the the vendors are our

610
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,630
understanding at least that but

611
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,950
something is it that they could do is

612
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,350
they already generate random passwords

613
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,929
for the wpa key they could just add the

614
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:33,790
admin password at the same time put it

615
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,799
on a sticker on the box and then you

616
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,480
would get rid of ninety-nine percent of

617
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,770
the problem if there is any d-link or

618
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,059
linksys got here

619
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:47,700
this the dip free some prints doing that

620
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,110
yeah some brands do now yeah most likely

621
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:53,440
and I know also d-link now they do the

622
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,720
intercept you're browsing HTTP browsing

623
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,789
they redirect you so they force you to

624
00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:00,070
configure the device but this is recent

625
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,440
devices and again this stuff works you

626
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,389
don't touch it in all upgrade unless

627
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:08,200
you're like us who wants 80 to that 11ac

628
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,450
and your network even if you don't need

629
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,120
it but that's not we're not getting

630
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:21,178
infected by this stuff anyone else

631
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:29,619
hi did you report anything to device

632
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:32,730
manufacturers and what was the response

633
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,700
so in this case know all of them the

634
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,669
specific cases were handled through the

635
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:42,879
isp in question for one the manufacturer

636
00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:45,129
so they were already dealing with them

637
00:28:45,129 --> 00:28:47,379
and for the others what we found was

638
00:28:47,379 --> 00:28:51,249
only the DNS attack which was using a

639
00:28:51,249 --> 00:28:54,909
standard channel no exploits no nothing

640
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:57,999
so we well I guess our approach has been

641
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:00,909
more awareness and public speaking and

642
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:08,859
then vendor contacts thanks alright

643
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:11,820
thank you very much everyone

644
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:16,359
[Applause]
