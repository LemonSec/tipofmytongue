1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,470
okay for are ready to start our next

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,320
talk please we have Clint Gibbler who is

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,349
a software security engineer from ncc

4
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,750
group he's been with them for just over

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,670
one year and he's going to talk to us

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,060
about examining vulnerability trends

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,820
over cross-industry please testing

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,510
testing all right I thank you everyone

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,640
very much for coming and thank you virus

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,739
Bolton for having me my name is Clint

11
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,059
Gibbler and today I'm going to be

12
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,550
talking about a quantitative examination

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,230
of the current state of corporate

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,840
security practices I tried to make the

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,719
talk name as boring and generic as

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,579
possible so that the people who came

17
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,210
were definitely interested so thanks at

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,289
a high level this talk is about

19
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,360
examining a vulnerability trends across

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,250
many companies and a number of

21
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,890
industries but first some quick

22
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,530
motivation so as security professionals

23
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,690
we tend to know what types of security

24
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,760
issues our company faces and we're

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,710
constantly hearing about various

26
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,020
breaches in the media but we're numbers

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,510
people right we want hard stats not

28
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,299
anecdotes unfortunately most companies

29
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,009
don't want to talk about what types of

30
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,509
security issues they face due to

31
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,759
negative PR reasons so that makes it

32
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,710
hard as security professionals to know

33
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,530
what should we work on to maximize the

34
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,259
impact of our work if you don't know

35
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:31,229
what the problem prominent categories of

36
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,590
problems are fortunately my company NCC

37
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,470
group has the results of running several

38
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,079
commercial security scanners on a large

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,820
number of companies across a reasonably

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,649
large amount of time and that's what

41
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,399
this talk is going to be about so

42
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,350
quickly just some goals of this work I

43
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,149
hope to give you all some insight into

44
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,649
the vulnerabilities faced by real

45
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:54,750
companies today I'm going to talk about

46
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,189
how quickly vulnerabilities are

47
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:58,530
addressed in terms of does it matter

48
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,390
based on the industry based on the type

49
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,340
of vulnerability or the severity and

50
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,500
things like that and finally I will

51
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,060
highlight some important areas for

52
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,318
further security research so first I'm

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,670
going to go into a little bit more

54
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,170
detail about the data set itself and

55
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,010
what we did with it

56
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,860
I'm going to show a number of figures

57
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,120
about some of the analysis results and

58
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,860
then finally I'm going to give an

59
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,860
interactive demo that allows you to

60
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,110
programmatically explore the data

61
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,280
without doing any additional programming

62
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,620
just sort of live ask questions of the

63
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,769
data so just quickly i'm a software

64
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:33,450
security engineer at ncc group domain

65
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,760
services before this I received a PhD

66
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,290
from the University of California Davis

67
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,250
where I focused in mobile security and

68
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,959
using a some of the projects i did

69
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,549
involved using static analysis to find

70
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:47,790
privacy leaks and android apps detecting

71
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,069
plagiarism between android apps emulator

72
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,720
detection things like that so feel free

73
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,730
to say hi to me later to talk about

74
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,909
those also I wanted to give a shout-out

75
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:59,849
to Carl Vamshi of managed services he

76
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:01,349
was the one who provided the data that

77
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,090
this work is based on and without him

78
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,650
this absolutely would not have been

79
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,159
possible ok so digging into the data

80
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,650
it's for 100 different companies across

81
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,230
10 different industries the scan period

82
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,540
ranged from february2014 through may

83
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,629
2015 comprising about 1,700 scans and

84
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:21,180
over 900,000 different individual

85
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,359
findings so every single finding was

86
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:25,889
manually vetted by a security engineer

87
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:27,720
to be either a true positive or false

88
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,199
positive and one challenge that all

89
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,750
discuss more later as well is that there

90
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,250
are a different number of scans and

91
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,930
different scan frequency between

92
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,699
companies so that can make it difficult

93
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:41,099
to compare companies or industries

94
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,340
directly because the data is different

95
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,849
but we'll see more why in a moment so

96
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,379
these are the specific industry is

97
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,500
involved each one has approximately 10

98
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,720
companies in it though some have a few

99
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,239
fewer some have a few more the hard

100
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,000
numbers are in the paper the average

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,980
scans per company actually has a pretty

102
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,019
broad range so you can see the health

103
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,129
industry is only about two and a half

104
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:09,629
but it actually gets up to a bit over 30

105
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:13,979
with a transport industry so if we look

106
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:17,190
at the number of findings per company as

107
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,738
some sort of metric you know how well is

108
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,560
an industry doing you can cluster it

109
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,810
into three groups there are several that

110
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,570
have under 5,000 findings

111
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,550
per company some they're sort of in the

112
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,000
middle and then some that are doing the

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,890
poorest have between ten and twenty five

114
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,150
thousand findings per company in that

115
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,940
industry one thing that's interesting to

116
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,150
look at is colloquially I think we all

117
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,310
believe that tools automatic scanning

118
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,780
tools tend to have a high false-positive

119
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,840
rate and this is definitely true in our

120
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,110
data set so we find that the industry

121
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,590
with the fewest false positives had only

122
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,510
51 percent true positives and it gets

123
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,790
down to as bad as only eleven percent

124
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,600
true positive findings so for a security

125
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,610
team at a company that's a huge amount

126
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,010
of work you need to do to vet through

127
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,230
all the different findings to see the

128
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:19,020
actual actionable information so i just

129
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,100
talked a little bit about the average

130
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,130
number of scans per company but that

131
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,960
doesn't necessarily convey the scan

132
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,510
frequency so that's what this attempts

133
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,630
to do so each individual little block in

134
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,790
this figure represents a company and its

135
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,130
color-coded by industry so what I did is

136
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,490
for all the scans for a given company I

137
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,620
calculated the time in between those and

138
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,260
then averaged that to form one number so

139
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,450
you can see for example that the

140
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,910
financial services industry is sort of

141
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,280
this yellowish color and you can see a

142
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,910
number of financial services companies

143
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,960
had scans on average between like zero

144
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,250
and five weeks and then a few more

145
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,620
between five and ten weeks and then one

146
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,160
about that so specifically sixty-three

147
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,080
percent of the companies had a scam

148
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,850
frequency of less than or equal to five

149
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,030
weeks and eighty-seven percent were

150
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:17,460
within ten weeks on average so two main

151
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,510
things regarding the methodology so as

152
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,350
there are over 9,000 different types of

153
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,580
vulnerabilities in the data set you

154
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,280
can't graph them all so I group them

155
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,260
into three high level categories and

156
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,700
then a couple of subcategories that

157
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,130
you'll see in a second but basically I

158
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,930
group them into do they relate to a host

159
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,390
system that is related to an operating

160
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,550
system version database versions

161
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,830
thing like that running on a host server

162
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,050
others are related to network issues and

163
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,700
then finally some our web app related so

164
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,420
I'm just going to give you a couple

165
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,470
examples to give you the intuition

166
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,660
behind how I calculated time to fix so

167
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:03,810
each s 1 s 2 etc represents one scan so

168
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,480
let's say we see a given vulnerability

169
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,940
there at the first game s 1 and then we

170
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,210
don't see it at s2 so the time to fix is

171
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,430
basically from when we didn't see it

172
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,230
back to the first time we saw it so in

173
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,830
this case s2 minus s1 so let's say we

174
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,470
scan at s1 and s2 and then don't see it

175
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,200
at s3 so then the time to fix is s 3

176
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,370
minus s1 so if we see something and then

177
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,810
it goes away and then it comes back we

178
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,920
treat that as two separate time to fixes

179
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:40,700
so an s3 minus s2 and then s 6 minus s 4

180
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,620
findings aren't necessarily fixed after

181
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,940
the last scan we have for that company

182
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,610
within the data set so in that case we

183
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,060
represented as what you would think sort

184
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,060
of s2 minus s1 to connote that's it was

185
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,980
open at least this long and then we

186
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,810
annotated with a plus to say you know we

187
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,490
don't really know how long it could have

188
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,180
been much longer finally a handful of

189
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,770
companies only had one scan in the data

190
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,810
set and because there was no opportunity

191
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,000
for those to be fixed we just don't

192
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,760
consider those at all so just keep this

193
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,590
in mind for some of the figures in a

194
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,970
moment so some caveats the precision of

195
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,890
our calculation is inherently limited by

196
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,930
the skin frequency because that's sort

197
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,260
of our data point so best case a company

198
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,530
fixes a finding right before we scan so

199
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,300
the time to fix is almost exactly what

200
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,299
we calculate a worst case they fix it

201
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,400
right after a scan and that company we

202
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,080
scanned very infrequently say every six

203
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,630
months so then we could be off you know

204
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,150
a huge amount and again different

205
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,890
companies in different industries have a

206
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,150
different number and a different

207
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,980
frequency at scans so it can be

208
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,400
difficult to make comparisons directly

209
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,390
but we do what we can okay so i'm going

210
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,470
to show you figures for

211
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,140
primary things first what issues do we

212
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,110
see in real companies today and second

213
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,510
how effectively are these findings

214
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,260
remediated and by that I mean two things

215
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,460
regarding the time to fix and the

216
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,250
overall rate of fixing and do either of

217
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,130
those vary by the type of vulnerability

218
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,030
the industry the severity or the

219
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,490
remediation solution which is what steps

220
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,200
do you take to fix it so I'm going to

221
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,240
show you some figures for the types of

222
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,550
findings across all companies and then

223
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,990
by specific industries okay so this is

224
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,990
all true positive findings across every

225
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,460
single company in the data set and so

226
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,350
the three high-level categories i

227
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,480
mentioned before the host related things

228
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,160
network related things and web

229
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,170
application related things are

230
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,400
represented here along with the

231
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,580
subcategories so we can see that the

232
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,920
most prevalent type of issues across all

233
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,560
companies are those related to the web

234
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,960
application server what's running it

235
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,710
such as Apache I is or the language used

236
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,100
such as PHP closely behind that we see

237
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,380
network related issues such as those

238
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,680
related to pki SSH and SSL are the next

239
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,470
most prevalent and then third web

240
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,240
application best practice related things

241
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,570
such as not including the secure flag on

242
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,700
cookies things like that and then

243
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,870
finally a general network related issues

244
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,670
so if we were to look at the financial

245
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,220
services industry in particular the

246
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,780
breakdown is slightly different but the

247
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,430
top four issues is actually the same

248
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,860
just in a different ordering in the

249
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,600
paper there's a figure for each

250
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,610
different industry just due to time I

251
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,460
can't show them all but something that's

252
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,230
interesting to look at is the transport

253
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,910
industry which is actually the most

254
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,700
skewed than in any industry at least in

255
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,590
our data set and what's interesting is

256
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,480
nearly all of the issues are related to

257
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,030
the web app server and language and very

258
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,060
little anywhere else so that's kind of

259
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,440
interesting so regarding the time to fix

260
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,350
I'm going to show you some figures for

261
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,000
the cat relating to the category of the

262
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,240
the severity as approximated by CBS s

263
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,250
score and finally the remediation

264
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,050
solution that is you know how are they

265
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,030
fixed okay so this is an empirical

266
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,860
cumulative distribution function graph

267
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,110
which sounds very intimidating but it's

268
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:30,390
not so here's how to read it so on the x

269
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,790
axis we have the time to fix in weeks

270
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,910
and in the y axis we have the fraction

271
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,370
of findings resolved so let's look at an

272
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,170
example of what that means so if we go

273
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,930
to x equals about 20 and then y equals

274
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,460
about 0.3 what that means is for this

275
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,370
figure which is all host related

276
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,400
findings and that line represents the IT

277
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,630
industry so within 20 weeks the IT

278
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,120
industry fixes approximately thirty

279
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,750
percent 0.3 of all hosts related issues

280
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:09,200
so essentially each of these lines is a

281
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,880
monotonically increasing that is as the

282
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,589
number of weeks increases the number of

283
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:16,770
things increases and essentially a line

284
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,950
is good if it gets to a higher y point

285
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,870
with a lower X because that means you

286
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,839
fix more things faster so some of the

287
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,470
lines go very much up close to 1 point 0

288
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,760
which means you fixed everything in that

289
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,700
category some of them stop much below

290
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,710
that which means during the whole course

291
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,210
of our data set those things were not

292
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,380
fixed so we see a number of industries

293
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,260
and I apologize if the color is hard to

294
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,450
make out in the audience all of the

295
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,400
figures are in the paper so you can see

296
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,589
them there but a number of industries

297
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:52,460
resolve pretty much all of the findings

298
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,940
host related things very quickly some

299
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,690
end up let's see I believe that's the

300
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,640
energy and utilities only ends of fixing

301
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,589
about forty percent in the big cliffs

302
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:11,339
you see mean large group of findings

303
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,430
were resolved all at once and you can

304
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,870
imagine patches being rolled out or

305
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,010
something like that so this is also time

306
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,200
to fix by category and each line

307
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,950
represents an in

308
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,780
tree and this is a web application

309
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,390
related issues so note that there tend

310
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,460
to be fewer sort of large cliffs here

311
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,080
things tend to be solved more gradually

312
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,080
over time so the host related things

313
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,460
notice how a lot of things are fixed all

314
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,100
at once while here things for web

315
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,570
application issues things tend to be

316
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,580
fixed more gradually and also add

317
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,730
overall a lower rate interestingly the

318
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,400
transport industry solves almost all of

319
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,980
them very quickly and overall does a

320
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:55,110
pretty great job okay so let's look at

321
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,690
the time to fix by CBS s score which

322
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,860
means basically severity and I grouped

323
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,850
CBS s scores between 1 & 2 3 & 4 etc so

324
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,320
one thing that's interesting to note is

325
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,050
that if you look between x equals like

326
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,200
zero to 10 so sort of at the beginning

327
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,480
within the first ten weeks findings are

328
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,210
not necessarily resolved faster just

329
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,980
because they have a higher severity in

330
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,780
fact we see some of the lower severity

331
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,420
things such as 3 to 4 and 5 to 6 being

332
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,480
resolved more rapidly one potential

333
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,280
reason for that is that the lower

334
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,040
severity findings tend to be simpler to

335
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,770
resolve so they're just fixed sooner but

336
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,930
we can see as time goes on towards the

337
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,270
end the most severe findings that is

338
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,130
those with CBS s and nine to 10 are

339
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,180
resolved at a higher rate eventually but

340
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,460
in in the beginning the higher CBS s

341
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,920
scores the most of your things are

342
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,270
actually not necessarily fixed in those

343
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:55,050
quickly which is interesting okay so

344
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,750
looking at time to fix by remediation

345
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,940
solution that is what do you have to do

346
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,630
to fix it this figure is mostly showing

347
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,940
things that involve updating packages or

348
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,070
software things like that we can see

349
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,750
these types of issues tend to be

350
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,000
resolved very quickly and in sort of

351
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,100
batches but environment specific things

352
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,350
such as updating the configuration the

353
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,860
blue line is resolved both more slowly

354
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,260
and at a lower rate so the takeaway from

355
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,440
this figure is that just applying

356
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,560
patches or applying updates tends to be

357
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,600
done at overall a high rate and

358
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,790
relatively quickly while environment

359
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,160
specific solutions

360
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,779
take a bit more time and tend to be less

361
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:45,149
likely to be resolved and then this is

362
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:47,220
also a time to fix by what you have to

363
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,730
do to resolve it solution group and we

364
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,730
see here that unlike updating a package

365
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,730
which tend to be done in batches and has

366
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,300
a high rate of being solved crypto

367
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,189
related things and web app things tend

368
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:04,589
to be resolved more slowly and at a

369
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,959
lower overall rate with web app related

370
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,269
findings being solved at a bit higher

371
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,279
rate and crypto things being a little

372
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,829
bit slower and a less overall rate so

373
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:15,470
one potential reason for this is that

374
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,610
Krypto related things tend to require

375
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,619
domain knowledge and maybe a little more

376
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:21,389
involved to fix and that is potentially

377
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:26,550
why it takes a longer time ok so I'm

378
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,399
going to show you a quick demo and it

379
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:30,839
was very useful for me and exploring the

380
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,040
data initially and trying to figure out

381
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,929
what sort of questions to ask of the

382
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:36,629
data and I think it's useful way to look

383
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,569
at examining security findings

384
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:40,920
unfortunately I can't open source this

385
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,110
as it uses a lot of customer specific

386
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,759
data but I'd be happy to talk about

387
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,559
implementation details later if you're

388
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:49,100
interested

389
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,920
alright let's hope this works alright it

390
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:08,180
kind of works ok so the layout looks

391
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,470
much better when it's on my other screen

392
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,869
my apologies ok so essentially all of

393
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,579
the findings have been loaded into this

394
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:20,089
one visualization and you can actively

395
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:24,170
filter by the vulnerability type the

396
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,940
whether it's a true positive or false

397
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:31,550
positive the CBS s score and industry

398
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:37,160
and what solution I should have

399
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,170
practiced on this resolution because it

400
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,420
looks much nicer on the other screen ok

401
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,390
so let's say we want to look at issues

402
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,330
in the financial services industry

403
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,970
specifically so you can see everything

404
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,980
is updating and let's say we want to

405
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,950
look at just true positive issues so now

406
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,160
for that specific industry we can see

407
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,980
that these are the types of true

408
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,340
positive issues so if instead we wanted

409
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:09,770
to say something like show me all of the

410
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,240
I don't know the most severe findings

411
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,620
let's say of CBS s score nine and ten

412
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,070
and i don't know maybe true positive as

413
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:27,920
well so we can see a let's see I think I

414
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,440
may have yeah they're kind of small um

415
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,300
so here's across all industry is the

416
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,300
most severe types of findings and if you

417
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,490
wanted to say look at specific

418
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,520
industries you could do that as well so

419
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,280
you can imagine adding to this also a

420
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,790
filter for what tool and what mode of

421
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,410
what tool was used to find these results

422
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,110
so that you could say you know which

423
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,300
tool is giving me the most value which

424
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,620
one is finding all the true positives

425
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,680
which one has a high false positive rate

426
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,330
and things like that if you wanted to

427
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,230
focus your efforts on

428
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,580
and resolving the most serious findings

429
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,929
as soon as possible you could look at

430
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:12,150
you know which recommended solution is

431
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,820
fixing the largest number of things from

432
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,690
my specific company and feel free to ask

433
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,429
me questions about this I'll click on

434
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:24,929
things for you if you want later and so

435
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:27,600
I'm just going to quickly reiterate some

436
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,299
key takeaways so across all companies

437
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:34,530
the most prevalent findings are those

438
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,179
related to the web app server or

439
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,040
language that is what's running the web

440
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,590
app or the language it's written in a

441
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,669
crypto related network issues such as

442
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:45,210
pki SSH or SSL web app best practices or

443
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,480
just general network related issues

444
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,020
there were some things we expected to be

445
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,460
true but they're actually confirmed by

446
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,340
the data the first is that managed

447
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,950
services that is companies that review

448
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,720
findings for you and give the actionable

449
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,370
results back to the company are quite

450
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,530
valuable in practice as the false

451
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,690
positive rate by industry tends to be

452
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,790
between 50 and ninety percent which is a

453
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,450
huge amount to sort through yourself

454
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,710
regarding the solution groups that is

455
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,530
the steps to take to fix things issues

456
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,179
that require updating a language or

457
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:20,070
package tend to be resolved both quickly

458
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,710
and at a high rate while environment

459
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,540
specific solutions such as updating

460
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,730
configuration tends to be slower to be

461
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,770
resolved and more likely to be left

462
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,400
unresolved and crypto related things are

463
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,780
the lowest likelihood of being resolved

464
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,580
at the end of the day between seventy

465
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,419
and eighty percent and next there was

466
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:41,790
some takeaways that surprised us a

467
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,880
little bit so as you would expect a

468
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,590
large percentage of findings is

469
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,210
addressed in the first 10 to 20 weeks

470
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,610
and as you would expect it tapers after

471
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,340
30 weeks but we actually saw a number of

472
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,880
findings reserved after 50 weeks which I

473
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,710
thought as a company you would just sort

474
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,270
of stopped caring after a certain amount

475
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,850
of time of not fixing some something but

476
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,590
things actually were resolved after

477
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,799
quite some time and at least within the

478
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,600
first 10 weeks there does not appear to

479
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,880
be a strong correlation between the CBS

480
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,700
s core and the time to fix but overall

481
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,470
at the end of the day hire CBS s

482
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,980
findings tend to be resolved at

483
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,710
higher rate and there's actually a

484
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,720
pretty big disparity twenty to forty

485
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,540
percent between industries of the

486
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,330
percent fixed for both web app and

487
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:32,110
network related findings so thank you

488
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,850
all very much for your time you can

489
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,100
email me there read other papers I've

490
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,169
written there or follow me on Twitter

491
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:40,630
I've tweeted like four times but maybe I

492
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,730
will more if you follow me but no

493
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:50,890
promises thank you do we have any

494
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:59,679
questions right here yeah one question

495
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,990
about the special cases that were

496
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:05,380
resolved was there a correlation between

497
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,860
the vulnerability being thread to the

498
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,169
company or being thread to a customer

499
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:14,049
for example crypto exposes the

500
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:16,660
communication of a customer but it's not

501
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,970
necessary and wouldn't a very serious

502
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,220
danger for the company itself especially

503
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,730
if they're negligent one okay let me

504
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,799
rephrase the question to make sure that

505
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,710
I'm answering it did I notice a

506
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,429
difference between issues that would

507
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:35,559
just affect customers versus potentially

508
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,570
affect the company itself such as a

509
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,860
sequel injection could affect the

510
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,559
company directly while not using

511
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,299
up-to-date ssl cipher Suites would

512
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:45,070
affect customers and not then directly

513
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,490
is that okay I think that that's very

514
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,520
interesting um I don't have an answer

515
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,440
for you at this time I haven't looked

516
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,080
into that exactly but it's something

517
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,950
that I should so I thank you but I don't

518
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,190
have an answer right now it's coming

519
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,460
tonight

520
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,909
great presentation thanks i love this

521
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:14,549
kind of data some of its startling I'm

522
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:16,590
curious what you're doing about it to

523
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,789
work with these customers or if anything

524
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:22,320
are you taking the data are you helping

525
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,090
them what's next yes so what's next um

526
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:31,770
let's see um I guess I have I happen to

527
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,690
have a backup slide for potential next

528
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:36,150
steps if I a time so one thing they

529
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,590
would be very useful is comparing the

530
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,570
efficacy of different scanners maybe one

531
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,390
tends to be overall better than another

532
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,700
and then you know what internal

533
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,280
practices lead to good performing

534
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,260
security programs reducing time to fix

535
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,500
stuff like that but specifically why you

536
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,210
asked one thing that we plan to do is

537
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,220
for either companies or industries that

538
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,900
we know tend to have specific problems

539
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,169
to work on either developer training or

540
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:07,169
providing specific focus and help to

541
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:09,539
them that sort of like targeted help

542
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:10,890
rather than giving the same help to

543
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:13,080
everyone sort of saying hey historically

544
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,970
we see have these types of issues let's

545
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,320
help you make sure that you don't do

546
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,980
that as much in the future so thank you

547
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:26,630
hi great presentation a question the

548
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,980
false positive rate you said was

549
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,450
anything between fifty and ninety

550
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,929
percent do you want to elaborate why

551
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:40,230
that that's like that yes let's say so I

552
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,210
guess there are certain fundamental

553
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,620
limitations in terms of building an

554
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,600
automatic tool in that you don't

555
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,460
necessarily have the context the human

556
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,650
would know when you're detecting

557
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:54,390
something let's see that's sort of a

558
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,890
generic answer in terms of the specific

559
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:05,700
issues we see see I guess I don't have

560
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,800
an answer that I can

561
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,570
definitely back up with data so i will

562
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,250
defer to talking with you informally

563
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:22,320
later about it but thank you i have a

564
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,120
question for you did you find any

565
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,420
correlation between the false positive

566
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,360
rate and the rate of fixing it so if an

567
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,830
industry is having a high false positive

568
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,960
rate are they less likely to go fix

569
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,520
something the ones that are experiencing

570
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,180
a better FP right oh that's a good

571
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:45,870
question so because of the services my

572
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,390
company offers the findings that the

573
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,070
customer receives are only true

574
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,660
positives so they would actually never

575
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,650
even see any of the false positives so I

576
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:56,460
don't believe there would be a

577
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,890
difference in any of our customers in

578
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,860
terms of their behavior but I know

579
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,400
informally in practice just being

580
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,280
friends with various tool building

581
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,470
company people that win you get

582
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,090
bombarded by lots of information that

583
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,070
isn't useful and actionable it does tend

584
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,870
to lower the amount that people actually

585
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,280
fix because you spend so much time

586
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,560
looking through things that the time you

587
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,909
spend on actually fixing them is less

588
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:31,360
any other questions ok well let's thank

589
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,699
[Applause]
