1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,069
I think we're about ready to get started

2
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,049
here if everybody would take your seats

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,849
thank you thank you for coming today I

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,849
think you'll we're going to have our

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,730
next presenter principal security

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,250
researcher for kaspersky lab's Kurt

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,220
Baumgartner he made sure that I got his

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,070
title correct I thought that but I've

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,050
heard Curt on many occasions speak and

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,029
I'm sure you're going to enjoy what he

11
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,000
has to say he's a gifted speaker as well

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,750
as a pretty pretty good principal

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,790
researcher I prefer to call him my

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,370
friend so if you would Kurt go for it

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,710
all right Thank You Larry hi there

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,360
welcome my name is Kurt Baumgartner

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,399
principal security researcher with the

18
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,590
global research analysis team at

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,559
Kaspersky Lab today I'm going to talk

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,949
turley we recently this month exposed

21
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,000
some of the infrastructures interesting

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,339
and exquisite appropriation of set

23
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,280
satellite communications for command and

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,710
control purposes so I will be talking

25
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,909
about that today so first off we'll be

26
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,200
talking about the turlet apt the

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,360
interesting thing about their name ultra

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,430
three dot sis was one of the first

29
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,380
drivers that brought this group

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,140
attention and when you scramble up ultra

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,229
you come up with Tula so that's one

32
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,170
reason it's called the turlet apt other

33
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,030
names they fall under is a venomous bear

34
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,100
there are all sorts of other names that

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,689
the incident response industry has given

36
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,189
this group but I'm going to stick with

37
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,040
the turlet apt and when I'm talking

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,079
about apt i'm talking about a who not a

39
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,450
what but we'll be talking about their

40
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,439
activity both the components that that

41
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,960
communicate over these satellite

42
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,259
communications and in the actual

43
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,619
technique of appropriating legitimate

44
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,420
satellite communications that they've

45
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,110
been using so again we've we released a

46
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,780
some research we called apt command

47
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,540
control in the sky this group is also

48
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,610
known for a lot of other activity their

49
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,580
water hauling campaigns at least one of

50
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,530
these campaigns we call the epic

51
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,319
Schurrle and that was very interesting

52
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,000
in that it highlighted how selective

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,730
this group can be when targeting a set

54
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,830
of victims so when their water hauling

55
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,590
and spraying a large number of people

56
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,410
stopping by a very interesting set of

57
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,400
websites they only deliver the real

58
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,019
carbon platform or their real package to

59
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,390
a select group of victims they're also

60
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,459
known for the penguin Herla or their

61
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,650
linux component interesting thing about

62
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,870
that component is that it was stolen

63
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,660
code from the phenyl it group years ago

64
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,860
and it also communicated over

65
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,040
appropriated satellite links agent btz

66
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,290
is when they really took the limelight

67
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,390
in 2008 it became widely known as a worm

68
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,060
that spread across Pentagon networks but

69
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,739
they're also known for chinch and other

70
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,780
follow-up variants and back doors that

71
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,840
are a part of their tool set their most

72
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,360
well known for their technical

73
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,430
capabilities as demonstrated by their

74
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,700
snake colonel component rootkit it has

75
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,019
it also has a ton of names uroboros

76
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:35,760
snake but we call it the carbon platform

77
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,160
and it truly is a platform its robust

78
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,650
and modular and then finally they're

79
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,230
also known for leaving debug strings

80
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,130
inadvertently in their code and the

81
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,620
group itself is suspected or their

82
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,600
artifacts in their code that indicates

83
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,299
some of these vlad gilg and uric

84
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:58,609
developers are quite possibly

85
00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:03,660
russian-speaking so before I talk about

86
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,400
the satellite communications themselves

87
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,959
I want to take a look at some of the

88
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,239
components of their tool set and some

89
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,850
interesting things come up whenever I'm

90
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,220
received researching this group so like

91
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,160
I said in 2008 they they made headline

92
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,289
news because agent btz was a worm that

93
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:22,800
got all over sensitive networks and as

94
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,300
matter of fact we found tens of

95
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,810
thousands of infections agent BTC

96
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,699
infections all over the world including

97
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:35,610
in Russia for years so up to 60,000

98
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:40,430
infections in 2011 and these worms were

99
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,020
initially distributed around 2007-2008

100
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,879
so interesting thing about all of the

101
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:50,310
publications to that point thread

102
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,690
experts blog post which in 2008 was

103
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,819
fantastic write-up F secures right up

104
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,610
and the the later gdata publications all

105
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,360
we're missing what the agent BTC

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,900
component downloaded from World News ath

107
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:12,120
CX and so I started looking through all

108
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,580
of the data we have we know that it's

109
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,490
downloaded to dollar sign 1f DLL and

110
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,500
this is injected into internet explorer

111
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,629
and I found I found the component so the

112
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:26,819
interesting thing about this component

113
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:29,279
is that it's simply it was described as

114
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,919
an encrypted blob but it's simply x

115
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,740
sword with 55 hex 55 it's when the ones

116
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,479
that I was able to find and they're only

117
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:43,349
a handful of these files were simply

118
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:48,990
updates to to agent btz itself so in

119
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,789
some instances they include a little

120
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:53,310
more functionality but for the most part

121
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,759
they're simply updated versions that we

122
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,569
have seen elsewhere the interesting

123
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,580
thing about the updated component is

124
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,710
that it was communicating with euronews

125
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:10,110
ath CX and that of course was another at

126
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,870
the time resolving to another IP address

127
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,789
that was a Sat comm link interesting

128
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:20,639
thing there are two other executables

129
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,639
that are identified in the agent btz

130
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:29,159
logs tapi 32 d dot exe and type CLI exe

131
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:31,770
and those are also mystery components in

132
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,210
the sense that nobody's ever documented

133
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,979
what those are they've always been

134
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,070
missing

135
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,990
but they well we can strongly suspect

136
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,320
that they are the agent de components

137
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,780
which also communicate over satellite

138
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,660
link legitimate satellite links at the

139
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,990
time hard-coded addresses satellite

140
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,920
addresses in Germany Russia China and

141
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:03,810
then Togo a sub Saharan state in Africa

142
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,370
alright so like I said the downloaded

143
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,800
component find is very rare and this

144
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,950
demonstrates turles high level of

145
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,110
sensitivity and selectivity when

146
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,360
actually delivering a payload to a

147
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,620
target or a victim system we found again

148
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,900
we found tens of thousands of agent vtz

149
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,490
infections in Russia but the handful of

150
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,600
downloads that I was able to identify

151
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,320
are really in the caucasus region

152
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,590
kazakhstan and eastern Russia again this

153
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,870
is very interesting stuff because nobody

154
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,420
has been able to identify even what was

155
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,260
being downloaded and all of those

156
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,400
components downloaded and well their

157
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,730
command-and-control servers were bisnis

158
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,240
ath CX this whole list right here which

159
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,030
at the time resolved to IP addresses

160
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,990
provision by satellite links satellite

161
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,870
comm owners so this is my colleague

162
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,900
stefan tanas he's not here today but he

163
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,910
spearheaded the effort in collecting

164
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,930
data and identifying this satellite

165
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,170
communication appropriation by the group

166
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:24,160
thank you Stefan so let's talk about the

167
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,320
communications themselves because this

168
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,320
is highly unusual that it wasn't noticed

169
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,700
until now but the the actual technology

170
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,270
for these satellite solutions were used

171
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,179
around 20 years ago and really they're

172
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:44,980
used in areas where there isn't

173
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,550
broadband access so where they don't

174
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,209
have

175
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:52,839
um network bandwidth they can use

176
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,420
satellite links for download for data

177
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,579
downloads and then they have this funny

178
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,589
way of connecting over a cable or

179
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:01,749
something else low speed a load

180
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,389
bandwidth solution for uploading data so

181
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:06,790
whether it's a 28 8 baud modem or

182
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,399
whatever else I haven't heard that

183
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:12,429
squelch for a while myself but the the

184
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:15,369
upload link goes through one of these

185
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:18,399
solutions interesting thing about that

186
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,670
upload link is that it also requires IP

187
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:26,230
forwarding but by the ISP and this is

188
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,300
also interesting because the phenyl it

189
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,709
tool set from early 2000s includes a GRE

190
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:35,079
tunneling protocol tool which is

191
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:37,149
something you would use in order to

192
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:41,860
tunnel this sort of response to TCP

193
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,889
connection over a satellite link so

194
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:48,399
that's that's an interesting tool set

195
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,740
the phenyl it tool set when it comes to

196
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,029
researching turlet activity so what was

197
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,189
Turlough really doing well they would

198
00:09:57,189 --> 00:10:00,129
sniff active ip's the data comes from

199
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:03,699
satellite communications usually they're

200
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:06,699
talking with an unused port on an on an

201
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:10,809
IP address or the active the legitimate

202
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:12,879
user of an IP address may have their

203
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,970
system down the system doesn't send back

204
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,720
a reset so the Torah operator listening

205
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,689
or the situ that's listening spoofs that

206
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,470
IP address and simply does a response

207
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,129
over their own cable spoofing the

208
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,540
legitimate IP address and magic you have

209
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,629
a hijacked link and the interesting

210
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:39,279
thing about it is of course this is

211
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,119
totally delocalized so your command and

212
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:45,819
control server cannot be seized because

213
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:48,399
and in a second we'll look at the spread

214
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,699
of the satellite communication but this

215
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:53,529
is thousands of kilometers satellites

216
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,199
will talk over the continent of Africa

217
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:58,749
so identifying that command and control

218
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:00,970
server and seizing it would be very

219
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,660
difficult so that's one thing that

220
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,490
you completely avoid you also gain or

221
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:12,310
the attacker games an anonymity because

222
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,740
really you're assuming the identity of a

223
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,240
legitimate satellite subscriber and and

224
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,459
providing yourself with another layer to

225
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:26,319
hide behind now there is the issue of

226
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,209
returning a communication over through

227
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:32,110
an ISP but again this is a region-wide

228
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:37,850
or a continent-wide data feed so it's

229
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,220
very difficult to identify and to seize

230
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,800
these command and control servers it's

231
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,500
an effective technique for maintaining a

232
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,639
long-term infrastructure so we put

233
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:52,399
together a nice jiff and unfortunately

234
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,370
this this is a PDF I had to go with a

235
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,899
PDF and unsecured list if you visit our

236
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:01,970
website you can see the full animation

237
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,300
but basically basically an infected

238
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,230
system will talk through a sad or talk

239
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:13,850
out to the Internet it will be directed

240
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,170
to an IP that that's resolved to a

241
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,630
satellite link provider the satellite

242
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,110
will spray the continent with the

243
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,120
communication from the infected system

244
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,329
and the the legitimate server if it's up

245
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:34,250
simply drops the packets that's what's

246
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,290
done on these vulnerable networks they

247
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:40,790
don't send a reset so so the connection

248
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,769
doesn't get killed that's a part of

249
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:45,889
what's going on here the Torah c2 in

250
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:51,189
turn can hear the hear the transmission

251
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:55,009
and then in turn hijack identify the TCP

252
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:57,759
sequence ID all that and send out

253
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,939
spoofed IP address over its connection

254
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:05,240
and respond to the infected victim

255
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,379
system so again finding that command and

256
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:12,949
control server and seizing it is next to

257
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:14,779
impossible it's not going to happen so

258
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:16,190
this is a very effective

259
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,100
nique unfortunately we have seen

260
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,710
multiple other groups using it including

261
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:26,750
hacking team so this is something that

262
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,940
unfortunately is going to be with us for

263
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,340
a while there are copycat groups for

264
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,940
things turl adieu and unfortunately this

265
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,550
may be another technique that gets

266
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:41,990
spread to other groups yeah so this will

267
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,650
probably stymie some investigations into

268
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:52,220
illegitimate traffic going on so how can

269
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,460
you snip some of the traffic coming

270
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,320
across these lines it's really pretty

271
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,170
inexpensive it's very inexpensive for

272
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,780
the turtle apt to carry on these sorts

273
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,890
of to communicate with this sort of

274
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,630
infrastructure so basically you need a

275
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,490
satellite dish you need some adapters

276
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,580
you need a Linux box and a connection

277
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,820
and really the bottom line is it's about

278
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,100
a thousand bucks to put together a

279
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,730
system like this in Europe in the Middle

280
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,260
East it's really pretty easy to find

281
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,080
somebody to install this the satellite

282
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,920
dish for you so even positioning the

283
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,560
satellite dish is something that could

284
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,390
be done for you and again that can all

285
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,210
be done under a thousand dollars it's

286
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,470
not difficult so I mentioned a little

287
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,120
bit that it's completely delocalized

288
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,960
this is one of the one of the very

289
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,260
desirable benefits of hijacking these

290
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,570
connections the see two servers simply

291
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:57,500
are not going to be acquired it also

292
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,810
increases your level of am nemidi

293
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,000
although it is not I would not call it

294
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,040
perfect because you do have to

295
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,320
communicate on an outbound line to

296
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,120
hijack the transmission but again the

297
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,220
satellite itself will spread its

298
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,230
communications sometimes over thousands

299
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,370
of kilometers what we've been seeing

300
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,690
most recently from the turlet apt and

301
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,130
what seems to be the majority of their

302
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,120
traffic is global abuse but mostly in

303
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,230
the middle east and africa

304
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,580
and that may be because these ISPs are

305
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,070
ones that simply have not been upgrading

306
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,110
their satellites and that elsewhere in

307
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,640
the world we see upgraded hardware

308
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,220
encrypted links and other techniques

309
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:48,200
that make that stymie this hijack

310
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,200
technique not to say that there aren't

311
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,630
vole neural satellites elsewhere but

312
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,370
this seems to be a favorite of theirs

313
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,440
another interesting reason may be

314
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,030
because simply there aren't a whole lot

315
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,750
of researchers in Togo that I know of at

316
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,760
least that would be interested in

317
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,040
sniffing the skies and capturing

318
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,470
Turlough related traffic in the first

319
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:14,210
place ok so the components that we've

320
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:17,920
seen over the past almost ten years now

321
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,150
communicating over the satellite links

322
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,690
include agent btz I think with a high

323
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,150
level of confidence we can say agent btz

324
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,060
was a part of the turlet a pt's activity

325
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,340
in the past that was questionable there

326
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,140
is an xor key that they have

327
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,000
consistently used for almost a decade

328
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,640
now in multiple components of their tool

329
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,300
set including carbon and some other

330
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,690
components but it well and the logging

331
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,270
facilities and filenames have been

332
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,130
pretty consistent for a very long time

333
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:53,120
which is unusual so knowing that these

334
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,670
guys are appropriating and using this

335
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,230
technique for communicating over

336
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,780
hijacked satellite links in all

337
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,080
likelihood well it increases the

338
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,240
confidence that agent btz was directly

339
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,670
related to turlet apt activity agent D&E

340
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,770
this is a component that really is not

341
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:17,900
publicly documented we have an md5 for

342
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,420
that downloader in our secure lyst post

343
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,160
if you want to research that yourself

344
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,280
it's a very interesting component and it

345
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,619
appears to be a precursor to the carbon

346
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:32,270
platform itself so it maintains complete

347
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,730
and while an interesting set of

348
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,310
dissimilarities with agent btz that

349
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,770
carbon the carbon platform does as well

350
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,860
including the lack of an xor key that's

351
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,140
been

352
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:48,150
used across components the use the use

353
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,370
of logging facilities and file names

354
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,590
that showed up an agent btz and other

355
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,360
components but just do not show up an

356
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,930
agent DNE or the carbon platform there

357
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,090
are lots of other dissimilarities that

358
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:04,730
DNA that indicate DNA is most likely an

359
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,700
introduction or a starting project for

360
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,690
what was to become the carbon platform

361
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,500
so these satellite links are all being

362
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,550
resolved using either these dynamic

363
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,020
domains or like with agent D&E all the

364
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,710
IP addresses are hard-coded which is not

365
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,740
frequent for this group but they do

366
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,670
maintain it in a number of their

367
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:38,220
components so most of the Turles abused

368
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,890
satellites are in Africa Middle East and

369
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,870
Europe so if you want to set up your own

370
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,700
satellite dishes that may be a good

371
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,240
location and please if you do share p

372
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,550
caps that would always be interesting we

373
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,730
know of almost one dozen ISPs that have

374
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,810
been heaven well maintained vulnerable

375
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,670
satellite technology and have been

376
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:03,810
abused by the traila apt the list at

377
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,730
least a good portion of it is right here

378
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,540
and they have been doing this since at

379
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,460
least two thousand seven in all

380
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,690
likelihood I may not have visibility

381
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,820
into previous components some of the

382
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:23,270
minute T components date back to 2004 so

383
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,560
quite possibly they were doing it

384
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,090
earlier than two thousand seven but

385
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,330
that's that's sort of where the trail

386
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:35,180
ends for now for us for our research

387
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,760
okay so I have some bonus slides that I

388
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,980
just kind of stumbled across because

389
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,460
well I did just I was looking at some of

390
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,770
these IP addresses this one in

391
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,750
particular this 83 dot 2 35 19 125 it

392
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,809
was being used in july and august of two

393
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:00,470
10 and at the time a greek isp who was a

394
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,860
satellite operator owned in provision

395
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,639
that that entire range in this IP

396
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,159
address is one that was used by the

397
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,909
updated sort of mystery component that

398
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:16,070
was undocumented as being downloaded by

399
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:23,389
the agent btz so this was definitively a

400
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:28,399
Turles e2 and a hijacked IP address so

401
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:32,029
what does this grease or this Greek IP

402
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:34,820
range have to do with old Cossack movies

403
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,450
and well as I was stumbling around I

404
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,639
found if you look in this corner you'll

405
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:44,710
see Victoria was communicating in 2007

406
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:52,009
from 83 dad 125 and the Russian here

407
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:56,210
basically shows her talking about well

408
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,820
the fact that she's 17 and she's just

409
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,830
reviewed a movie so she's very young

410
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,559
she's watching an old soviet era Cossack

411
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,149
movie and she's saying you know this

412
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:07,340
isn't really what life is I'm not sure I

413
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,039
really think much of this movie and

414
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:15,169
previously when a year previous to that

415
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:17,990
Victoria was on another forum and she

416
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,139
was talking about living in Russia and

417
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:25,159
wanting to study in Greece and this is a

418
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,460
very strange coincidence it's it's odd

419
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,749
that you have Russian students who are

420
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,399
moving to Greece and then a year later

421
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:36,619
the same IP address is being co-opted

422
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:39,740
for Turlough situ and I don't totally

423
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,720
understand that connection and this is

424
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,720
last minute research but quite possibly

425
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,340
if we look through some more old Cossack

426
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,679
movie reviews will uncover a little more

427
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:53,869
corolla apt infrastructure yeah so with

428
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:55,960
that I'm going to close up I'm going to

429
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,570
finish up here and if you have any

430
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,950
questions about Turlough let's let's go

431
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,720
yeah

432
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:15,390
per Mikan so question is if someone will

433
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,120
set up this satellite dish and you

434
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,640
listen is traffic can he decrypt it yeah

435
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,250
so question is can you decrypt the

436
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,270
traffic if you're collecting it the

437
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,919
turlock not all of the turlock

438
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:36,010
components necessarily communicated with

439
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,940
encrypted traffic so the answer is in

440
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:53,860
some cases yes yeah another question is

441
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,020
there any actual use for the satellite

442
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,299
communications except for off course

443
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:00,159
people who are between behind those

444
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,830
links so i would guess that simply

445
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,650
filtering out every single satellite

446
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,350
based communication from your company

447
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,299
network would would be a pretty good

448
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:13,840
idea and i don't think that would draw

449
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,820
the baby out of baby with the bathwater

450
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:19,780
so that i don't think that would hamper

451
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,260
your typical company operations at all

452
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:26,909
so the question is would filtering these

453
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:30,490
satellite provision IP ranges be an

454
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,890
effective way to defend against terlalu

455
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:40,419
a PT attacks and you know so so first

456
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,250
the in there there are problems with

457
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,309
that so first if you're a company that

458
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:48,610
you're interested into selling into the

459
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:52,630
Middle East Africa or Europe that would

460
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,640
be a real issue you won't have visitors

461
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,789
from these entire ranges and quite often

462
00:23:57,789 --> 00:23:59,950
well most often these are client

463
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:04,690
machines anyways so I guess outbound

464
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,970
connections to those ranges would be

465
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:11,260
something that could be interesting the

466
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,600
other the other issue is that you're

467
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,100
talking about the turtle apt and if

468
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,130
you have an IP range that is being

469
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,710
blocked they will just move on to the

470
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:28,169
next one so they will find a way to

471
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,770
enhance their components to work around

472
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:36,820
your IP filtering that it it would be a

473
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,070
simple way to start but I don't think it

474
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,570
would be effective against this group in

475
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,689
particular

476
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,070
and you have questions all right well

477
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,840
Thank You Curt all right
