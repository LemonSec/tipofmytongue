1
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,130
okay thanks for joining us during the

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,270
second session of this track on stage we

3
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,970
have Alexandra Buddhist from gdata who

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,980
has some samples to show us of

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,769
smartphones which has installed malware

6
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:28,289
and that's the presentation he is going

7
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,359
to give us so please welcome Alexander

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,010
thank you very much I'm the team lead of

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,020
the mobile naval research team at the

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,090
data and I'm going to speak a bit about

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,910
some of the preinstalled mobile devices

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,480
we encountered in the last year's so but

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,090
first let me start with a bit of

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,320
self-promoting because the data is found

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,899
was founded in 85 and I want to thank

16
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,210
Martin if he's here for holding the

17
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,789
keynote of security summit last week

18
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,769
because we actually turned 30 last week

19
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,100
and especially I wanted to thank him for

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,450
the whole mutational some slides because

21
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,720
we had some problems at our side there

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,530
so we turn 30 and think we're one of the

23
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,119
oldest companies and probably one of the

24
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,860
biggest because we have sixty thousand

25
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,250
five hundred please worldwide but said

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,189
Lisa's North they are beasts which

27
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,770
produce the honey you get last night of

28
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,920
the receptionist honey pots so we have

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,640
five hundred humans doing the work and

30
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,170
we are all based on mostly based in

31
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,610
bochum so let's start with the talk the

32
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,829
agenda for today is a bit of background

33
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,070
story the star 9500 device we

34
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,470
encountered starting of 2014 I'll go

35
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,479
then and into detail into some more

36
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,090
malware and do some more samples and

37
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,009
devices we gather and so on the last

38
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,310
year's I'll talk a bit about how to

39
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,680
generate the money or where we sink

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,049
money is coming from and then going to

41
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,389
talk about ways out of this dilemma we

42
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,539
have

43
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,610
so the star n9500 this was the device

44
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:21,970
that got things rolling for us so we are

45
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,800
actually in the Android store with our

46
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,580
mobile solutions since the beginning of

47
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,879
2011 and encountered air a lot of

48
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,830
malware from an out of the store we saw

49
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,480
a lot of things happening with a lot of

50
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,370
different devices we had to deal with

51
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,160
and we have a very good communication

52
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,660
with customers we have a lot of waste

53
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,430
they can contact us and rule of

54
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,090
telephone support also and when in the

55
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,640
first quarter 2014 customer came to us

56
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,200
and said I can't delete this malware

57
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,459
what's wrong can you help me we stay

58
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:56,379
true sim and cetera okay please give us

59
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:58,360
some information we talked with them we

60
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,400
wrote several emails he was very false

61
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,140
convenience information thankfully and

62
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,040
attitude out the Mafia was installed in

63
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,299
system apps so this meant for us we had

64
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:15,880
no access to it it was in the read-only

65
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,079
memory no right to do it first and then

66
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,720
we looked further and so there were many

67
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,280
the same devices with the same

68
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,019
application and that despite our

69
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:29,290
interest and so we asked him please give

70
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,540
us more information where'd you buy this

71
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,459
device until he said well actually a

72
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,340
bottle uh not zone and he sent dusted

73
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:46,720
the link the star on n9500 4 stars 165

74
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,060
euros so maybe something like hundred

75
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,590
fifty dollars specs look nice at the

76
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,030
time and it was ready to be shipped in

77
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,370
two or three days so we actually did

78
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,060
directly buyer and hadn't thought really

79
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,639
much about it because is the device

80
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,769
device arrived three weeks later it was

81
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:15,669
shipped from hong kong and we had

82
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:17,500
actually to pay more money to jump

83
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,970
customs because they didn't like the

84
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,010
device as a third and we actually have

85
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,450
the same malware on the device

86
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:30,430
customer so on it was you you pay it was

87
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,030
hidden as the google play store service

88
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,650
it wasn't the place of service it wasn't

89
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,390
separate Apple just used the same name

90
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,640
there was warning all the time had

91
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,930
extensive permissions to install

92
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,240
applications applications research

93
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,380
applications and so on started on boot

94
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,440
and had read write and send SMS rights

95
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,630
to play with SMS so read some reviews

96
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,490
and talk about the customers and they

97
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,970
all said well after three weeks the

98
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,920
device started acting strange sorting

99
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,840
stuff and so on and so we waited a bit

100
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,170
but nothing happened on our devices but

101
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,830
thankfully the code was clear enough so

102
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,410
the device uploads some data like the

103
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,970
device ID email Maxim info device heart

104
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,710
information and so on to a server and

105
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,750
response cats and time mod code when to

106
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,640
call back to the server and the list of

107
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,740
ID's from apks to install from a

108
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,500
hard-coated store so of course we looked

109
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,970
at the hard-coded store and actually in

110
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,010
the third quarter last year we

111
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:41,080
downloaded 6001 have and twenty percent

112
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,280
turned out to not be clean so for the

113
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,320
conference we downloaded the sample some

114
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,630
samples again the top list this time

115
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,750
only 4400 but don't ask why the numbers

116
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,920
is just random and we thirty percent

117
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,140
nearly turned out to not be clean so a

118
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:04,530
lot of dangerous stuff in the store well

119
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:10,000
so we dig deeper and probably not you

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,220
are now asking yourself it's October the

121
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,380
first 2015 and he's talking about it

122
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,260
device with 2013 why should I care why

123
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,960
should we care and actually if you go to

124
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,300
amazon right now he finds the device

125
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,450
still there i'm at home cleaned up the

126
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:30,180
store in 2014 but it's again there and

127
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,880
actually this isn't the phone i showed

128
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,610
you before this is the n8000 so same

129
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,760
developer manufacturer

130
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,850
and it's a phone we also recommended by

131
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,590
security researcher when we published

132
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,770
our findings in 2014 at the same APK

133
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,460
installed but then you can say well

134
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,550
price okay also good reviews should be

135
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,670
okay we didn't buy the phone but we

136
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,930
looked at the reviews and there was very

137
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,330
nice review in German sorry but I put

138
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,510
out the important part in English here 4

139
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:07,710
stars what seems to seemed odd to me so

140
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,420
if the fact that the device appears to

141
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,190
be rooted that at least is information

142
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,750
that i saw on display when i try to

143
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,150
install an online banking app so for

144
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,980
security concerns I decided against

145
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,930
installing the online application online

146
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,360
banking app but still you have mental

147
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,960
device so reviews are kind of

148
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,240
interesting somehow and sometimes well

149
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,840
but now let's skip the background story

150
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,490
and go to a bit nero time so we promised

151
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,140
you more devices and more marvel and

152
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:46,110
here we go um well actually sorry back

153
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,490
to the n9000 up on that for a moment

154
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,490
because this was one device and we had

155
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,390
one signature detecting the sample and

156
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,490
our signature was for the Dex file in

157
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,090
the APK is a compiled code and this one

158
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,910
signature we had to look at and then

159
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,280
they found that we already saw this one

160
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,000
signature on over 100 different devices

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,410
and i see some guy's nose squirting the

162
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,870
eyes to read this and it's hard to

163
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,060
readers and i did on purpose because i

164
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,000
had a lot of bad time getting through

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,650
this data and i think we should do the

166
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,570
same it was not fun and actually it's

167
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,490
horrible because most of the data we got

168
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,720
here is random garbled string so

169
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,900
something like Sweeney maybe can be a

170
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,960
device but this actually is not usable

171
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,049
it's some version code so the data we

172
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,960
got two distinct the devices it's mostly

173
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,300
not usable and doesn't lead to anything

174
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,780
for us so

175
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,940
of course we dig further and using the

176
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,040
informations we had on the manufacturers

177
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,779
and the package names the epilayer the

178
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:01,110
server to connect to and so on we found

179
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,449
even more devices and more devices when

180
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:06,240
we reach 250 we stopped because for us

181
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,670
we had enough information to go on and

182
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,190
we just wanted to do this first before

183
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,899
getting even more samples and devices

184
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:18,389
out there so we took a moment to take a

185
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:21,360
breath and think about how this goes on

186
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,370
and we are still trying to dig through

187
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,180
all others but actually next thing next

188
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,259
thing happened because in early 2015 the

189
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:32,790
biggest German computer magazine

190
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,250
computer build what is to do a very of

191
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,959
the sea on me and the whoever I device

192
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,959
to compare them and when doing this they

193
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,060
found and very interesting church

194
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,709
application where the package name was

195
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,769
spelled with one T and said a lot of

196
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:49,380
scary permissions and they asked us for

197
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,319
help and we talked to the application

198
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:55,649
had a look at it and it turned out to be

199
00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:00,449
a malware so this one we was called and

200
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:04,040
app we found it in several a B case

201
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,019
mostly piggybacked Facebook or Twitter

202
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,550
occasions so they took the original

203
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,740
application and edit a malicious part to

204
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,250
it it also has extensive permission so

205
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,519
it was able to install the leech we

206
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,740
start packages receive on Boozer present

207
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,800
and so on and we saw this on XE army

208
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,170
device and 4 and 3 1 plus study Ruby

209
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,860
occido x 111 and so on so many different

210
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,100
devices but actually funny thing is we

211
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,350
facebook or twitter part wasn't touched

212
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,189
so they didn't put something in there to

213
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:40,639
get the Twitter or Facebook account

214
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,019
seemed like they don't want message

215
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:47,130
facebook but so edit maybe function to

216
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:51,839
the APK so succeeded x 100 also very

217
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,069
nice device where the sample was on also

218
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:59,939
on amazon also with nice reviews

219
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:02,490
one-star reviews this time

220
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,620
after a few days it started to download

221
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,390
by itself some battery apps menu and

222
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,089
memory apps and it's now three times as

223
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:16,550
slow yeah nice next device next malware

224
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,450
android trojan downloader the device

225
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,570
from 2014 called icebox it's a very

226
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,130
steady outdoor phone and you can

227
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,870
actually total nail the war with it and

228
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,230
[Music]

229
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,250
where was the application called

230
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,220
settings provider also some extensive

231
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,700
missions and the education that came up

232
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:56,630
and thought was right yeah and

233
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,190
prosperity the south from the czech

234
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:11,240
particle co-operators so it seemed like

235
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:47,850
30 people so actually to say how old are

236
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:53,310
the device XP just swallow carry the

237
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,149
device factory directly to the user care

238
00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:02,120
enough to a beautiful no matter

239
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,970
it's a bit more about it relax Jane many

240
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,450
people are involved start people handing

241
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,670
the revised one another and maybe that's

242
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,190
a relaxing factor to go and he is

243
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,670
advised to each other but then it is

244
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,900
something mounted it's actually some

245
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,240
kind of matter many people involved many

246
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,720
companies make places to advisors and

247
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,190
someone machine that can be some one of

248
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,790
the black hat actually when you tell the

249
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,220
King yesterday by ross anderson he

250
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,770
talked about the warehouse in Dubai

251
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,680
where nice to people got into took apart

252
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,150
some point of sale terminals an

253
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,310
adversarial to them to see critical

254
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,730
information if they could with the

255
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,760
soldering and this device it why

256
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,590
shouldn't they be able to open

257
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,310
smartphones and thanks to them and well

258
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,410
it would make sense to go into warehouse

259
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,630
full of devices with judo bunch of

260
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,050
laptops and narrating stop they need to

261
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,190
be special our efforts and actually

262
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,810
secure list found something on the

263
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,290
Chinese division in Sweden 14 and this

264
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,420
simply a special purpose device to boots

265
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,930
to install software and Martin's a

266
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:29,710
pretty rare but this is true I think

267
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,340
busted out I put our report out on the

268
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,340
star and another report although the

269
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,370
other devices two mins ago we also money

270
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,170
tall directional public and there was

271
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,050
one publicly impact form an entry from

272
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,420
someone I think you can visit so I

273
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,970
zoomed in a bit he wrote whenever

274
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,560
tomorrow we had a relationship with a

275
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,480
few people who charge money to companies

276
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,400
like ours to have our apps pre-installed

277
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,500
you could pay extra to have the app

278
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,750
baked into a custom rom to make it non

279
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,430
removable and someone replied why not

280
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,580
offer a one time payment to a manager at

281
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,320
the factory why do you pay every time

282
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,290
for each app and yet reply to us that's

283
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,190
the kind of suggesting

284
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,050
that would you get ahead quickly the

285
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,230
company like that so if you trust random

286
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,440
a ver right at a random public forum

287
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:29,050
this is 100 plan proof we have so to be

288
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,250
honest as an other side we have to look

289
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,670
at because it's not only the Maori All

290
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,060
Souls this is a big business model we

291
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,370
have here the password you need to know

292
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,110
is pre and post loading there are

293
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,210
companies out there trying to help you

294
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,040
to decouple the hardware and the

295
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,370
software process so you are able to

296
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,110
still ship your hardware when it's ready

297
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,540
even software's not ready and be able to

298
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,140
just hopefully get the software done and

299
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,450
roll it out before the device which the

300
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:02,950
hand of the customer so what the game

301
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,930
community is called downloadable content

302
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,840
with the LCS and get paid extra for can

303
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,390
do here as well and this company also

304
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,700
provides services like epic

305
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,550
illuminations so you can give the use of

306
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,320
the best device experience as possible

307
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,120
by helping him to give him the best apps

308
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,510
and one company had an example saying

309
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,600
that the movie company HBO paid them one

310
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,960
euro 22 a verified app install that

311
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,490
isn't much money for HBO probably

312
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,990
because the subscribe description is

313
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,660
much more but you think in kind of a

314
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,510
mayra also who owns one year 20 per

315
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,850
install and is able to run sense house

316
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,850
of installed it was one mostly this

317
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,660
makes sense and this is also a new era

318
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,360
of bloatware coming so see what this

319
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:56,500
brings so what could be done against us

320
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,930
what could the manufacturers do so it's

321
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,580
the first thing is easy if you have a

322
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,490
device you need to be sure that this is

323
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,630
a device you really wanted to buy

324
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,609
because what I didn't mention before

325
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,520
when we had the device how could we be

326
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,109
sure that this device is really what we

327
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:14,859
wanted to be it is it's really a samsung

328
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:18,010
XE army what is it so for example see

329
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,630
army provides an online page where you

330
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,420
can verify the code of the device so to

331
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,119
be sure is a hundred percent real advice

332
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,369
from them

333
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,500
and actually there are some couple of

334
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,380
cases in Germany some months ago but

335
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,840
people bought their phones at night at a

336
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,420
pub because of those bargain they were

337
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,690
offered iphones for 150 euros and then

338
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,820
the next day I doubt it be some rip off

339
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,130
device with android on it that's looking

340
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,350
to be like an iPhone so lesson learned

341
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,270
don't buy your device drunk and night at

342
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:55,000
the pub next thing they could do of

343
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,250
course manufacturers here are seeding

344
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,920
the device so the 10 packaging support a

345
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,290
seat on it and if you device gets

346
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,059
shipped to you and see the problem you

347
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:06,100
should should really think what to do

348
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,400
next return it ask why it's open was it

349
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,809
open ship to or someone before or be

350
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:17,710
more careful on the other side if you

351
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,960
use on your ball to the phone like I

352
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,450
said buy from a trusted source you

353
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,120
should check the reviews there are many

354
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,460
reviews for phones out there and some

355
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,800
are good some are bad but some will tell

356
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,650
you there's a problem is the phone have

357
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,440
a look for those of course check the

358
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,559
device for tempering check the origin of

359
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,880
the Vice this is really advise you

360
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,840
wonder and if possible replace the firm

361
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,570
lobster device with a stock rom I think

362
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,840
15 years ago everyone told their friend

363
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,030
here their friends if you buy a new

364
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,520
computer vibe it should make a fresh

365
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,350
windows installed just Broadway or not

366
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,480
and it seems we have the same now on

367
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,290
android and of course install mobile

368
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:09,610
security solution for trusted source so

369
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,950
we have some time left and one small

370
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,340
thing i have because all the devices

371
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,920
showed you our android for devices or

372
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,490
earlier and actually a fear and android

373
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,820
5 device it's a renewal case read node

374
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,179
from 2015 and it's a very nice device

375
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:30,130
great feature set for a really great

376
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,670
price you can get it in europe we are an

377
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,130
online shop for something around 150

378
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:40,060
hundred 60 maybe 30 euros more if you

379
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,630
have to pay

380
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:44,680
and I bought this device in an online

381
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,920
shop like I said and derive three weeks

382
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,040
later in this package and actually now I

383
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,840
think my neighbors are totally clear

384
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,000
that I'm something of a drug lord and at

385
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,890
least for them it explains all the

386
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,570
hoodies I own and the smartphone's i

387
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:02,230
have about well it was a very sturdy

388
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,880
package that's four that's four for sure

389
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:09,430
in it was the case also looked very nice

390
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,940
and the problem was it has a sealed the

391
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:17,860
sea was broken but well maybe there's a

392
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,780
reason and of course there is a valid

393
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,610
reason in this case because there was a

394
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,040
quality control checklist and i'm a nerd

395
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,220
I like checklist a lot and there's a

396
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,950
phone option it's why it has a charger

397
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:34,240
and let me zoom into there's the rude

398
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,390
checkbox firmware update will disable

399
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,830
super user or what it is not checked but

400
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,150
it's good they didn't touch the for

401
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:46,000
nursing and actually you could order a

402
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,440
rooted phone for four euros extra I saw

403
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,310
later on so we took the device into our

404
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,650
lap did the first analysis on all the

405
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,990
installed applications 500 of

406
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,260
pre-installed apps and seven the flag

407
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,560
dial systems for further analysis and

408
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,390
two per turn out to be a potentially on

409
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,190
model program for where clean

410
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,530
applications just treating our Arista

411
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,220
conversed look edit and one was a very

412
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,320
special Google Search application which

413
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,060
when you search something opened here

414
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,950
who seriously from so we took it apart

415
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,110
and there are several ad networks in it

416
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,240
which upload a lot of data to the

417
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,760
command control server and to the earth

418
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,850
networks it was able to install various

419
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,560
application from different online sites

420
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,040
so you was really a lot of features it

421
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,800
could do in this way and it was able to

422
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,800
show up walls and we're still working on

423
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,300
just because it has a lot more to offer

424
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,110
for us and to dig into and the something

425
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,890
with beepers going for next

426
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:58,660
weeds I think so actually if you google

427
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,180
for the device you quickly find more

428
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,000
informations and you will find on the

429
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,490
first hits articles about the device for

430
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,380
example aggies china which say are

431
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,600
saying it's a great advice perfect but

432
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,420
please some shops pre-installed some

433
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,490
custom vibe you roms which include

434
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,230
multi-language and Google Play services

435
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,240
while that might seem like a handy thing

436
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,450
to have it isn't in fact since those top

437
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,880
brahms do not support otra air update

438
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,220
comes a lot of blow dryer and run much

439
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,050
slower than the original lenovo stock

440
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,360
rom and often include viruses adware and

441
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,810
spyware yeah so actually is known that

442
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,000
these protons has a problem we are

443
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,410
supposed to clean them and we did it we

444
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,660
took the phone we will solve the lenovo

445
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,740
roam across looks perfect sense so the

446
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,740
conclusion there at the moment many many

447
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,540
many dirty phones out there if you want

448
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,700
to have your own just by some random

449
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,160
phones and I'm not sold on eBay which

450
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,510
are pretty cheap and have a nice feature

451
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,190
set the chances are great you find some

452
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,500
applications to play with on the other

453
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,170
side what I didn't tell you before and

454
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,540
most phones there was not only one

455
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,580
application it was never the case where

456
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,230
we are interesting to have a look at so

457
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,600
one phone often leads to many other

458
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,520
phones you can do do real work with so

459
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,720
that's it for my part if you have

460
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,630
questions should think your licks on the

461
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,820
so please wait for the microphone raise

462
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:37,150
your hand anyone hi we're all of the pre

463
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,090
installed malware applications apple or

464
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,370
app install type malware or were there

465
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:47,350
other types the the gross like ninety

466
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:51,400
percent are these app installation email

467
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,780
records for everything they earn the

468
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:58,210
money by paper app install so we had

469
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,070
some other may have a pre-installed on

470
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,140
some devices which just seemed like

471
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,320
information gathering or tests various

472
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:05,970
tests are

473
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,970
for further campaigns but we didn't have

474
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,680
ransomware pre-installed you didn't

475
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,560
found as an SD does pre-installed which

476
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,910
was the single purpose so it's like a

477
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,650
complete remote access tool kit every

478
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,470
time just at our apps are mostly pretty

479
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,060
extreme at what they can do when the

480
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,700
functions they have but they seem to be

481
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,980
restricted mostly installing apps and

482
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,050
given helpful a pro commendations to

483
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:35,340
users and just a second follow on for

484
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,820
the app install malware did they all

485
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,040
require user interaction to actually

486
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,690
install the app or were there any that

487
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,310
are just downloading installing the

488
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,000
background without any user interaction

489
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,950
most provide both ways actually they

490
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:54,660
have often the way a way to say via the

491
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,190
command and control server its

492
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,260
application to be installed is supposed

493
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,540
to be insulting the background also be

494
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,950
suppose in the foreground whose user

495
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:06,150
interaction and some even go so far that

496
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,060
they have code included and just check

497
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,860
on a daily routine for a script from a

498
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,140
server the download and execute was rude

499
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,850
so some some malware had a method which

500
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,280
every time for an update download the

501
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,430
script which then remount complete file

502
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,950
system is right permissions installed

503
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,870
everything everywhere and then unknowns

504
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,170
it again so those cases but mostly in

505
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:36,050
the background another question

506
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,970
I had the question did you report these

507
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,190
instances to Amazon because it seems

508
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,950
like most smartphones would be trapped

509
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,350
funds come from there and if you did

510
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,020
what was their response i'm also not

511
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,390
really interested in so when we did this

512
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,840
thing in 2014 they had a lot of cleanup

513
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,980
they removed to some devices and

514
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,230
actually refunded several of the buyers

515
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,880
the money when they couldn't get in

516
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,940
contact was a solder touché answered so

517
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,590
they were interested because it's puts a

518
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,270
bad light on them and they're active and

519
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:13,710
doing stuff there do you know how

520
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,299
distribution of used smartphones or

521
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:17,919
would be trapped smartphones compares

522
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,790
between amazon and say ebay doing bad

523
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,980
players prefer amazon because it's more

524
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,990
mass market and in maps I've can only

525
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,299
answer was a gut feeling I have not not

526
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:34,030
real data and this is that we saw most

527
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,809
anonymous on than somewhere else because

528
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:40,299
for many people that are not at a she at

529
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:43,870
the most guys here it's hard to tell if

530
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,120
you're buying from amazon or if you're

531
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,070
buying from someone else on amazon they

532
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,410
don't meet you make the distinction so

533
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,919
they just see it click buy now and

534
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:54,940
they're done wizard they may be

535
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,559
wondering what advice takes three weeks

536
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,490
to ship but that's it and that's

537
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,990
something you can find at the rebbe use

538
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:05,049
of this device devices that many people

539
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:08,049
bought the device and after several

540
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:11,290
weeks had a normal technical difficulty

541
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,690
with the device and then the Rev you

542
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:16,600
start to drop badly because people say I

543
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,460
can't get in contact with the seller

544
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,070
heat teak takes weeks to ship the device

545
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,410
ID to pay extra custom fees for shipping

546
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:27,010
the devices so I think most people don't

547
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,809
realize whether by the device for them

548
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:31,320
is a mod-soul another seller on amazon

549
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:37,150
thank you any more questions if not then

550
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,140
let's say thank you to alexander

551
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:46,179
[Applause]
