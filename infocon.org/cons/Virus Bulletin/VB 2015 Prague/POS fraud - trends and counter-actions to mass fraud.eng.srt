1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,510
okay our last speaker for this session

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,090
is chem Dunham who's going to tell us

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,280
about mass fraud I assume that something

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,839
the Pope does but I think we'll be

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,199
finding out about that we have sound

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,980
thank you thank you John Doe but I den

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,029
well I hope you've had a good time here

8
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:29,070
in Prague i've enjoyed it myself have

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,570
been here since saturday it's been great

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,030
I'd like to know though how many people

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,280
here in the last 18 months have known

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,579
someone in their personal lives that

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,469
have suffered credit card fraud of some

14
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,719
type raise your hands someone that you

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,430
know in your personal life that has

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,940
that's it for credit card fraud really

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,440
okay now how many people here have

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,660
personally suffered credit card fraud

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,300
and had to have their cards changed okay

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,239
now of those how many people have

21
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,859
actually had fraud because they went to

22
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,750
a gentleman's club in the last 24 hours

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,080
and they don't want to admit it put your

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,610
hand down yeah all right well I've been

25
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,860
doing this since does anybody know what

26
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,659
year I started an antivirus research

27
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,990
1989 so that's why I have a lot of

28
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,990
letters behind my name because I'm old

29
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,210
but i will say that things have changed

30
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,450
quite a bit since the day of flat file

31
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,430
and floppy and factors and simple

32
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,380
viruses and so that's what we're going

33
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,030
to talk about today the focus is on

34
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,820
point of sale malware trends and I'm

35
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,579
going to be talking about the greater

36
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,200
adversarial contextualization of what we

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,640
have going on in the market place

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,000
globally it's going to focus less on

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,290
hardware and things like what our

40
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,909
keynote discussed and more on

41
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,460
understanding the governance and the

42
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,840
marketplace and what we're dealing with

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,360
in terms of threat assessment so that's

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,430
what I'm going to focus on but first I

45
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,570
just want to let you know that I've been

46
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,640
here since saturday and i've been

47
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,409
traveling quite a bit i've had a really

48
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:08,818
good time and i have lowered my risk by

49
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,619
spending all my money before i lost my

50
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,840
wallet of course i'm a bill murray fan

51
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,380
cuz i'm going to

52
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,320
old guy right got to love it but I want

53
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,690
you to think ahead here at the end of

54
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,250
the talk we're going to have a little

55
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,810
bit of a discussion about how you lower

56
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,350
your total risk exposure right and the

57
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,540
impact of potential point of sale fraud

58
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,340
risk and other types of fraud that might

59
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,230
come in the future with the way that we

60
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,900
do our transactions I want you to think

61
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,480
preventive Lee and from a point of

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,240
mitigation in this case here Bill Murray

63
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,430
it's it's going for him that he already

64
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,810
spent all of his money so when he lost

65
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,060
his wallet he really doesn't care what

66
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,820
is going for you when it comes to

67
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,300
point-of-sale malware is there anything

68
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,250
going for you and the way you're running

69
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,750
your business or the way that our

70
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,520
merchants are handling the transactions

71
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,890
the way that the card members and the

72
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,030
various protocols that are being

73
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,010
implemented is there anything in that

74
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,220
picture that's going for us think about

75
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:12,060
that well this is a website that after I

76
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,400
lost my wallet i went to just to see if

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,890
my credit card had been compromised in

78
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,230
fact you can go there now because you

79
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,790
can hook up to Congress I know it goes

80
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,200
back and forth to in Congress and

81
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,330
Clarion down here but you can hook up on

82
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,650
your mobile device right now actually

83
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,900
and go to this website and and I'd like

84
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,340
you to fill that out with your credit

85
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,840
card and your expiration date and then

86
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,460
raise your hand if you've checked it and

87
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,660
it actually shows that you've been

88
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,520
defrauded okay yeah you've done that I

89
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,340
see you smiling yeah alright well I made

90
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,900
sure the domain was not actually

91
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,880
existent when I actually did the

92
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,270
presentation okay but there are actually

93
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,580
in the underground phishing pages and

94
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,230
things that look just like this it looks

95
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:58,110
really legit right but it isn't I sure

96
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,760
hope somebody doesn't create that domain

97
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,380
name now I'd feel bad about that a

98
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,970
little bit all right well a decade ago

99
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,140
when i was doing underground

100
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,150
counterintelligence i was able to scrape

101
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,150
over million credit cards a day that

102
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,240
were new live and valid and i had track

103
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,100
one details and it was trivial to

104
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,810
perform those cards were still good they

105
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,450
had not been monetized they had not been

106
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,370
used in any way and in some cases they

107
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,100
would stay on the

108
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,530
market or be exposed in various public

109
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,370
fashions for weeks or months do you

110
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,330
think that's the case today not at all

111
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,260
because back then getting all the data

112
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,980
big data in a big crime world was a big

113
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,500
deal but they didn't have monetization

114
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,090
strategies in place they didn't have

115
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,610
money mules they didn't have the ability

116
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,320
to do the laundering and the movement in

117
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,210
and out of various banking institutions

118
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,670
in various countries and across you know

119
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,830
transcontinental it's a problem on how

120
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,600
you actually monetize that asset so

121
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,030
things have changed quite a bit for the

122
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,950
bad guys I want you to put on your head

123
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,360
thinking about the bad guys with that in

124
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,160
mind we've had quite an evolution of

125
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,040
threats back in the day we had simple

126
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,820
Trojans viruses just little knock off

127
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,650
threats that really were very newsworthy

128
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,300
and they were interesting but literally

129
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,550
they were just trying to get a picture

130
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,560
of a girl on her cam or something it was

131
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,920
stupid child's play but we also had some

132
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,180
people that have been going after the

133
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,310
gold for some time and we have had this

134
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,400
natural transition towards a crime

135
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,710
espionage and major assets that are now

136
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,920
enter dependent upon our technology and

137
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,240
so with that we've seen a major

138
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,190
transition and I got to tell you from a

139
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,100
bad guy perspective what is perhaps one

140
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,750
of the worst things that's happened in

141
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,200
the underground for us as good guys in

142
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,210
the last 10 years if you just thought

143
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,280
about it what is it the Russians the

144
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,800
Chinese the Romanians pick your country

145
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,990
right because everybody's in on it now

146
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,050
even if they don't admit it is that the

147
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,400
worst case scenario that we have

148
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,100
nation-state and other things well I

149
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,110
would say that it has more to do with

150
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,840
capabilities and that source code

151
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,760
releases was a really big deal when it

152
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,880
comes to e-crime think about it back in

153
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,850
the day anybody remember a gavotte he

154
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,710
didn't live too far from here remember

155
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,890
yeah and a gavotte was like the bot back

156
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,320
in the day we'd all the security

157
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,550
researchers have been going here for

158
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,229
10-plus years we all know who he was

159
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,569
right well agra bot then

160
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:40,429
was developed into something known as

161
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:43,490
fat butt and then the source code was

162
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,169
released and this was Bar None the

163
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:47,599
number one bot in the world and it was

164
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:49,939
really amazing comparable to anything

165
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:53,059
else in the wild at that time and the

166
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:55,580
source code was released for that what

167
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,259
happened after the source code for fat

168
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:01,369
pot was released we had the year of the

169
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:04,490
bot right with thousands of bots and

170
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,429
knock off BOTS why because now we have

171
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:09,889
heavily commented code readily available

172
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:12,319
very easy to work through and we have

173
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,149
now empowered and enabled through

174
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:17,089
training access and assets the ability

175
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:20,379
for the bad guys to do bad things and

176
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:23,509
over this year over this decade rather

177
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,749
we have also had a significant number of

178
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:29,629
highly skilled people being trained

179
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:31,490
specifically for counterintelligence and

180
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,979
adversarial capabilities people that

181
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:35,419
have been working on this from a knee

182
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:38,029
crime perspective so you've got highly

183
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:40,459
skilled actors with the best code in the

184
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:43,819
world remember Craig's he called it my

185
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:45,619
doom he's Craig in the room I don't see

186
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:48,259
Craig here but my gym was the number one

187
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,629
email threat back in the day at that

188
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:52,399
very moment until the next big one came

189
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,800
along right and what happened with my

190
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,740
doom there was a my doom A and a B some

191
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,149
people might remember this right then a

192
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:01,039
quote unquote see or do you call it

193
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,479
something a little different but boom

194
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,430
what happened within a two-week period

195
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,529
was a massive infestation and then the

196
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,180
source code was dropped on every single

197
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,019
computer that had it possibly as a way

198
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:13,789
to avoid plot you know to have

199
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:15,649
plausibility deniability in case they

200
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:17,479
got arrested they're not the only guy in

201
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:18,860
the world with the source code for the

202
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,159
worm so we've had a lot of things making

203
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:26,749
it easy for the bad guys now we've also

204
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:28,639
had a change in the way that things are

205
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,199
done as well because we've had

206
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,929
maturation moving from singular like

207
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,669
with trojans and viruses that were

208
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:37,039
knockoffs right to automation and

209
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,169
full-scale capabilities I remember meta

210
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,139
Fisher back in what was it 2006 where it

211
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:44,600
moved to a web-based C&C model and we're

212
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,069
like wow that is going to be totally the

213
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:48,139
future because that is a great way to

214
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:50,209
have a lot of computers and you can do

215
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:51,120
all kinds of domain

216
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,900
and IP games and now we have fast flux

217
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,000
we have bunny flux whatever you want to

218
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,820
call it flexing we have a DGA all kinds

219
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,410
of fancy little acronyms to say that

220
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,250
there's a moving target out there so

221
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,630
let's look at the vectors of attack

222
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,450
focusing in on point-of-sale malware and

223
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,850
oh by the way if you didn't know I'm an

224
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,430
incident responder by trade so pretty

225
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,170
much every single major event that's

226
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,880
happened this entry I've been on it or

227
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,130
I've been lead ok so I'm talking with

228
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,890
the experience here what do we often see

229
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,650
is the number one kind of issue its

230
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,200
people right it's the old chain the

231
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,990
keyboard or what is it keyboard to

232
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,200
computer error right yeah the human and

233
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,240
that's what we're seeing there a lot of

234
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,100
times with point-of-sale fraud you're

235
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,300
dealing with people that are disgruntled

236
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,400
or they're financially desperate they're

237
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,839
into drugs or having problems in their

238
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,490
personal life or there's some kind of a

239
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,990
motivation for them to hurt your company

240
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,420
but bottom line is that's kind of the

241
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,730
insider threat but the one that actually

242
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,760
happens more frequently in point-of-sale

243
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,740
fraud from what i have seen anecdotally

244
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,800
is not the disgruntled insider but who

245
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,100
the one i have not yet mentioned the one

246
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,570
there's kind of an insider but not

247
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,730
really the one that's trusted inside of

248
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:16,410
your network is who yeah huh maintenance

249
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,930
guy yeah exactly it's your trusted

250
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,270
contractors right it's going to be your

251
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,279
janitor it's going to be the guy that

252
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,890
has HVAC system capabilities it's going

253
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,140
to be you're the guy that comes in and

254
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,940
dispatching on some third-party whatever

255
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,070
and he's got access to it and you don't

256
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,020
have governance and control over his

257
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,240
system do you you don't have governance

258
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,410
and control over his behavior

259
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,990
necessarily and whatever he does inside

260
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,279
of your network you may not be watching

261
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,160
that very closely either so with all

262
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,240
that in mind third party and or people

263
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,980
that have elevated rights that should

264
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,080
not have it or really more the issue and

265
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,640
a lot of times it's do some kind of a

266
00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:00,020
VPN connection we also have skimmers and

267
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,850
those can be used to collect your credit

268
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,020
card details this isn't really

269
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,370
point-of-sale proper

270
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,650
like what we think about when we think a

271
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,060
point of some malware right like

272
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,400
actually on the terminal but this is a

273
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,860
point of compromise it you should be

274
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,260
aware of people can put these inside of

275
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,640
their clothing and they can do a double

276
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,920
swipe they head over to the register you

277
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,790
don't know what they're doing to your

278
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,830
credit card right and they can easily

279
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,080
swipe it in their clothing and you

280
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,660
wouldn't even know and then we've got

281
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,279
point-of-sale terminals which is what

282
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,690
most people think about when you have

283
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,970
come to a talk like this you think it oh

284
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,070
yeah that was actually compromised okay

285
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,080
well that's true those have had

286
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,820
compromises on them and some of those

287
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,290
have access to the Internet where you

288
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,760
can do direct thick filtration of the

289
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,640
data in real time and some do not in

290
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,680
fact some are segregated so that they're

291
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,690
only on an internal land but that

292
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,550
internal land has to get out somewhere

293
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,250
in order to do authentication to make

294
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,589
sure your credit card works and we have

295
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,620
the funds and is authorized right now if

296
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,029
I'm looking at when I say that it's

297
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:04,170
nothing personal okay and then we have

298
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,480
the database the back end don't forget

299
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,220
about this architectural if you're a bad

300
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,529
guy and you have access to the database

301
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,240
in the back end even if it's encrypted

302
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,370
you're going to try to get at that right

303
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,200
and there are point-of-sale malware

304
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,390
attacks that have taken place on the

305
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,970
back end believe it or not and they are

306
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,920
very sophisticated they know what

307
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,089
they're doing and what about the future

308
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:28,440
the use of square and other similar

309
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,890
mobile devices or the bill to just take

310
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:35,279
your Apple pay phone just magically

311
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,839
happens right isn't that awesome I have

312
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,540
a phone like that I think is cool well

313
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,550
it's totally convenient people love it

314
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,620
but there's a reality of the fact that

315
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,540
as we adopt these new technologies and

316
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,790
solutions and we make it easy right

317
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,130
convenience that of course naturally as

318
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,720
we all know anybody's been in security

319
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,070
longer than two minutes knows that

320
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,250
you're going to pay a price on your

321
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:00,930
security right okay so we're dealing

322
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,870
with an issue now or counterintelligence

323
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,540
with the bad guys in point of sale in

324
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,150
particular point of sale this is perhaps

325
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,250
the most important component here the

326
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,430
red line that they are actually doing

327
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,260
Counter Intelligence against your entire

328
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,050
net

329
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,850
work they don't want to just have access

330
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,620
to the one terminal they want to have

331
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,050
accessed the entire chain of stores they

332
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,850
don't have access to one computer they

333
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,160
want to map out the whole network they

334
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,930
don't want to just get in there and get

335
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,700
out they want to own it for a long

336
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,980
period of time and in most cases most

337
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,720
breaches or how long before people know

338
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,760
about them 200 plus days accorded in

339
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,279
many studies and even after you see

340
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,740
fraud losses on the cards and you're

341
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,899
told as a company that you may have a

342
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:48,339
problem with your department store in

343
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:50,230
your point of sale how long do you think

344
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,760
it takes for you to find it if you

345
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,050
didn't even know it was there and you

346
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,110
only see the losses how many people

347
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,600
think one week you could find it if you

348
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,040
were told you're having losses that are

349
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,810
directly attributable to your customers

350
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,670
you probably have a point of sale

351
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,839
malware how many people think they could

352
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:07,390
find it in a week on their network two

353
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:11,740
weeks three no hands for weeks takes a

354
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,839
month to find it how about two months

355
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,880
three months yeah it's a troubling

356
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,310
reality and we all know there are some

357
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,959
networks that are better architected and

358
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,180
governed in others right and in most

359
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,339
cases they don't know and they can't

360
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:28,839
find it and given the skill of our

361
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,220
adversaries and the counterintelligence

362
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,110
they put in there for two thirds of a

363
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,870
year before they start to do mass fraud

364
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,020
during the holiday season or something

365
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:41,160
they prepared for your counter response

366
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,140
they want survivability this is not

367
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,510
about surviving a reboot this is about

368
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,180
longevity on your network for maximum

369
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,950
fraud you're not going to shut your

370
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,110
business down we're not going to do some

371
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,899
kind of denial service threat to try to

372
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:57,459
say well shut you down right before the

373
00:14:57,459 --> 00:14:58,959
horse races like they used to do in the

374
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,279
UK back around the turn of the century

375
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:03,610
right we're talking about owning you you

376
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,680
know your own and we continue to own you

377
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,199
while you continue to do business ouch

378
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:15,670
so let's look at the wins and losses for

379
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,500
the good guys and the bad guys in blue

380
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,610
and in red on the left we have the

381
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,279
merchants the point-of-sale providers

382
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:27,070
people like that consumers we're losing

383
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,260
and on the right we have the adversaries

384
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,520
who are winning

385
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,350
in every category and these are just

386
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,840
anecdotal by the way as we take a look

387
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,200
at this we see that reputational risk

388
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,630
and the magnitude of loss is significant

389
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,640
millions of dollars for these various

390
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,140
companies that have had breaches they've

391
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,640
had to tell people don't shop at their

392
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,800
stores they get rid of their carbs they

393
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,550
don't go there anymore ever again and

394
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,930
then do you think it matters after we've

395
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,730
had so many disclosures so many

396
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,320
companies have been compromised your

397
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,080
point of self fraud I mean can you go to

398
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,380
any store and assume that you're safe

399
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:06,580
does anybody do that I don't think so so

400
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,100
with that we have a high impact and it's

401
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,930
very personal to you once it happens to

402
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,750
you and I wonder how many merchants are

403
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,220
out there wondering when it's going to

404
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,430
happen them not if but when right we

405
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,350
know in the antivirus world that people

406
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,690
moved away from the concept slowly but

407
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,130
surely some still haven't gotten there

408
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,720
but most have they realize they're going

409
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,490
to have virus infections it's an

410
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,920
accepted risk but they have controls in

411
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,860
place like antivirus firewall etc so

412
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,140
that they can minimize the magnitude and

413
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,300
the impact of those and if they do have

414
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,730
a risk they have got procedures in place

415
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,880
like a guy like me they're going to do

416
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,040
incident response and stop the bleeding

417
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,350
and minimize the damage and the impact

418
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,270
so we've been able to do that in the

419
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,400
world of antivirus but do you think the

420
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,070
point of sale and merchants out there

421
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,990
have that capability are they used to

422
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,250
even dealing with these kinds of threats

423
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,020
and having those kinds of controls and

424
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,630
countermeasures and response plans not

425
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,300
at all i can tell you I've been shopping

426
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,280
here in the Czech Republic they've been

427
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,619
here for very long time and they do not

428
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,540
have these controls in place they are

429
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,390
owned if it comes to that and they have

430
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:17,890
that kind of fraud trivial number two we

431
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,290
have supported legacy issues even in the

432
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,030
United States for the rolling chip and

433
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,459
something or other it's not truly just a

434
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:26,859
dedicated Chip and PIN our keynote did

435
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,370
an outstanding job talking about the

436
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,170
actual movement of hardware and the

437
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,210
vulnerabilities of hardware components

438
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,070
right but I want you to think about this

439
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,830
from a rollout perspective especially in

440
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,240
the united states where it's low-hanging

441
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,820
fruit because we know in europe it

442
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,750
largely is what kind

443
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,430
the cards something smart EMV right but

444
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,080
if we look at United States

445
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,780
comparatively on a global basis the

446
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,550
United States where most of the POS

447
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,440
based fraud disclosures have taken place

448
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,170
in the last 18 months we see that they

449
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,060
are only using the mag stripes and

450
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,540
that's where it's easier to monetize and

451
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,310
even if we move over to some kind of

452
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,190
smart solution like I've got a card

453
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:14,560
right here and this is an example of a

454
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,730
us-based card that now has a chip okay

455
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,710
but it also has a magnetic stripe on the

456
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,440
back so it's not dedicated to just that

457
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,780
chip technology they have to have the

458
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,370
magnetic stripe because there's too many

459
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,890
vendors that only do the old solutions

460
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,990
and legacy solutions and it truly is

461
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,970
about a liability shift that is a big

462
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,470
deal and I believe that we're going to

463
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,360
see major changes in that landscape over

464
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,250
the next five years because of the

465
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,930
massive amount of fraud that's looming

466
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:44,350
we're headed for a cyber Gomorrah okay I

467
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,420
believe we're headed for a cyber

468
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,030
Gomorrah in such an infestation in a

469
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,100
maturation of the wickedness in the e

470
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,860
crime world that with our inter

471
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,320
dependence on technology and the rapid

472
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,700
pace of how we're doing things it's

473
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,520
going to be very evil and we're going to

474
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,300
lose first before we start to have wins

475
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,700
so we have legacy issues and adoption

476
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,830
issues liability issues with the various

477
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,170
merchants with poor governance they

478
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,370
don't even know how to roll it out or

479
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,590
manage the security let alone figure out

480
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,180
the taxes and go in there and I'm not

481
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,950
trying to say people are stupid these

482
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,540
are complex systems they've got other

483
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,790
problems to solve and especially small

484
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,320
businesses they don't need to be worried

485
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,850
about that kind of thing and yet they

486
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,650
have these point-of-sale terminals very

487
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,470
vulnerable imagine being a small liquor

488
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:33,910
store and having a contractor who is

489
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,490
servicing your computers or your point

490
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,740
of sale or something else and then next

491
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,350
thing you know you have an infection on

492
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,360
your machine and that then leads to

493
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,330
pointed some our well now your entire

494
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,480
system and your bank accounts and all of

495
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,430
your clients are all at risk all of

496
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:54,580
those assets not just one everything is

497
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,670
at risk

498
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,000
or Los and we've got little to no

499
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,190
incident response capabilities like we

500
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,900
said before it can take days weeks

501
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,480
months for you to mitigate it or even

502
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,730
identify the stupid thing because it can

503
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,680
be very difficult to find some of these

504
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,630
codes they're not just like an

505
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,490
executable sitting right there they

506
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,340
might be filus or they may be something

507
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,770
we haven't seen before and it may be

508
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,930
very difficult to identify and track it

509
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,480
down and the ways that they go about the

510
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,130
capturing can be very dynamic and

511
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:28,220
diverse so on the Left we have a high

512
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,890
risk and low reward and on the right we

513
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,410
have low risk and high reward and that

514
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,140
means that we're promoting with the way

515
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,560
we do things today ich rhyme and I like

516
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,020
one of the sessions of course we had a

517
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,410
discussion over monetization and costs

518
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,810
and other things and Apple devices were

519
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,000
considered to be a little bit less

520
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,010
targeted why because of the cost of the

521
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,680
developer and other things bottom line

522
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,790
is ROI went down for Apple based

523
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,450
products comparable to say Android okay

524
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,240
because of the model and the way that

525
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,070
we're impacting the bad guys when they

526
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,900
try to perform fraud and there's a lot

527
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,190
to be said for that we have to put a

528
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,530
dent in their ROI while increasing our

529
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,510
ROI and lowering our total fraud losses

530
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,620
it is a numerical issue like I said I

531
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,450
believe it's the Sodom Gomorrah it is

532
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,790
truly a tidal wave this is about how we

533
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:27,470
do business ok so our transactions are

534
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,000
changing how many people here have been

535
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,040
using credit cards while they've been

536
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,520
traveling yeah how many people have used

537
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,460
check you got to use check in some cases

538
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,960
anybody use actual cash yeah you've got

539
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,210
to get on the metro right something like

540
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,620
that and say you're going to maybe do

541
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,150
that a lot of small businesses that's

542
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,410
all they accept they want anything

543
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,450
except a card right so you're going to

544
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,800
hit you're going to do both of those and

545
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,120
I believe we're going to do more things

546
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,000
related to our mobile or our virtual

547
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,650
identity especially through our phones

548
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,020
our phones are becoming very quickly our

549
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,100
social security cards of tomorrow we

550
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,779
have

551
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:08,879
convenience and safety we even have

552
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:10,499
exchange rate issues I got to tell you

553
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:12,149
if I go down to the marketplace that

554
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:13,769
tried to charge me twenty percent down

555
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:15,690
the Old Town Square to do a freaking

556
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:18,869
exchange and I'm like nay I know enough

557
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:22,200
to say that in check and next thing you

558
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,049
know I got a seven percent rate well you

559
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:28,320
know that's that's nice I appreciate

560
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,710
that well if I go down to the ATM how

561
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,119
much of my pain on my card to cash out

562
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,019
two percent right and i'm putting my

563
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:41,820
debit card at risk potentially for a

564
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,940
skimmer but there are reasons why people

565
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,559
are using these cards and why we're

566
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,879
going to see more use of these and

567
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:50,099
adoption in fact we see that look in the

568
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:51,809
picture you'll notice that one of the

569
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:54,869
images that we have up here is Chinese

570
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:57,960
and China and Japan have gotten into

571
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,869
this culture of debt management and

572
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:03,059
spending and credit cards and we're

573
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,769
seeing a massive explosion of that in

574
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:07,559
Asia in particular so our culture has

575
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,769
changed globally now towards this at the

576
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:15,749
same time rapid adoption of mobile so

577
00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:20,429
point of sale continues to emerge while

578
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:23,609
the crime develops we have a lot of

579
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:26,489
victims and in some cases like the FBI

580
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,429
said over a thousand businesses infected

581
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:32,789
with back off but is that one actor one

582
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:36,509
group or that multiple people using the

583
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:41,190
same code anybody know it's interesting

584
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,409
but the scale of that is staggering

585
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:45,720
because prior to that nobody even knew

586
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,549
and it wasn't just well some people know

587
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:51,659
but it was not disclosed okay and what

588
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:53,279
about things like the Carter toshiya

589
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,220
campaign in Chewbacca I love that name

590
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,599
that's a great name I don't know who

591
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,450
came up with that but way to go I like

592
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,269
Star Wars to my dog's name is chewy so

593
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:04,859
that's pretty awesome name for a point

594
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:06,840
of malware but we have a lot of

595
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,489
different kinds of codes and more

596
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,019
importantly if you understand your

597
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:12,119
taxonomy and functionality capabilities

598
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,549
we take a look here look at this here

599
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:16,940
when we go across this

600
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,920
into things that are botnet related and

601
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,350
we're looking at marketplaces with USD

602
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,910
and Bitcoin we got 32 and 64-bit type

603
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,980
payloads that are deployed increased

604
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,540
sophistication we've got mail slot

605
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,430
exfiltration here so you can do

606
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,080
real-time stuff that you wouldn't expect

607
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,200
to see necessarily if you do have the

608
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,880
ability to do X filtration and that

609
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,460
means based upon the protocols and the

610
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,440
internet accessibility your LAN

611
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,430
architecture etc and then we have people

612
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,250
moving towards Near Field Communication

613
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,480
payments and that sort of thing so I

614
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,430
think we see a dramatic change in the

615
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,320
way we're adopting culturally and the

616
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,190
way we're going to be doing our

617
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,470
transactions meanwhile we haven't taken

618
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,760
care of business on the point-of-sale

619
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,760
front in terms of hardening and security

620
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,770
so really it is an access of futility

621
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,410
and that is the sad reality of where

622
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,690
we're at we always see this action

623
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,340
reaction and the world of security

624
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,690
you've been in at more than five years

625
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,390
and we saw that with bots and we saw

626
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,370
that with macro viruses it's interesting

627
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,890
now how we killed off macro viruses

628
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,180
around the turn of the century how we

629
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,790
see so many now coming back in right and

630
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,650
what I'm seeing businesses do

631
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,260
anecdotally are employing hips or other

632
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,560
kinds of controls to more accurately and

633
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,710
granularly stop actions like say opening

634
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,570
up a macro and then writing to a drive

635
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,400
or performing some kind of network

636
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,020
communications that would not normally

637
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,650
be expected in a business place but it

638
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,570
is an act of futility to some regard

639
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,670
small businesses are under-equipped

640
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,590
understaffed and they don't understand

641
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,240
and they don't want to and it's going to

642
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,980
cost them a lot of money to avoid the

643
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,750
liability so eventually they'll buy that

644
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,420
big expensive processor and they won't

645
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,770
like it they'll probably have to pay

646
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,630
increased transaction fees for every

647
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,120
card they process it'll hurt them and

648
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,510
that will be passed on to you as a

649
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:16,250
consumer do you remember in 2003 back in

650
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,350
the day where we had credit cards but no

651
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:21,410
monetization now that monetization is in

652
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,540
near real-time or real-time and you

653
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,920
might even get a call a couple minutes

654
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,690
later somebody asking for an OTP or

655
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,100
something else that they might need and

656
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,320
literally performing that triangle

657
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,299
action to take money out of your bank

658
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,799
account while they're freaking talking

659
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:36,919
to you on the phone okay very fast very

660
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:39,559
different than ten years ago this

661
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:41,899
represents maturity of the marketplace

662
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:45,049
for monetization and laundering and the

663
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:46,779
ability to move that money around

664
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:49,909
whereas before it was about big data for

665
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:52,610
them we're just now talking about dlp

666
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:57,679
and other things in our space so as we

667
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,720
start to talk about Chip and PIN and

668
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,669
will it really make a difference and I'm

669
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:03,110
finishing up here with the last slider

670
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,250
to I want to ask these questions within

671
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,509
the framework of what do we know about

672
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:11,120
these cards right as you look at the

673
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,679
anatomy of a credit card you have track

674
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:14,629
one track to data usually both tracks

675
00:27:14,629 --> 00:27:17,659
are red so that if one isn't read

676
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:19,519
properly or there's corruption the other

677
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:22,039
ones are redundant backup track 3 isn't

678
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:24,559
often used and of course there's a

679
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,169
method to the madness if it starts with

680
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:29,120
the four I know it's a visa if it starts

681
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,029
with like a 5-1 of 55 somewhere in that

682
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:33,590
range it's going to be a mastercard

683
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,259
that's just how it works okay and you

684
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:37,879
have been numbers and yes that's a legit

685
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:39,860
website where you can go look it up so

686
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,110
you can see the bank identification but

687
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,629
will chip cards and EMV actually change

688
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,730
anything and the answer is yes it'll

689
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,309
drive up our costs of card manufacturing

690
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:51,320
and management it'll drive up the cost

691
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,340
for the merchants as we take a look at

692
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,940
these new cards the bottom line is is

693
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,080
that there's a lot of ways to implement

694
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,519
it there's diversity within the

695
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,049
marketplace they all have their own ways

696
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:05,090
of doing it but they are making an

697
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,679
effort and it does help with the

698
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:10,639
security to some degree but it doesn't

699
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:15,590
stop a crime attacks and losses it

700
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,889
changes how they monetize but it doesn't

701
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:21,529
stop the collection of assets and card

702
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:24,230
numbers in pins or other things that may

703
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,659
come with that and the monetization is

704
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:28,940
still trivial in card-not-present type

705
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,980
transactions chip or no chip so future

706
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,110
considerations on my last slide here I

707
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,389
want you to think about does it really

708
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:40,340
matter and I think it does if you don't

709
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,139
have some of these devices in the next

710
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:43,149
few years and United

711
00:28:43,149 --> 00:28:44,379
states where they're moving away from

712
00:28:44,379 --> 00:28:46,989
the old mag stripe and torts more of

713
00:28:46,989 --> 00:28:49,359
what Europe has traditionally adopted I

714
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:51,580
think that the liability will shift

715
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,619
towards those small businesses and it

716
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:56,559
will put some businesses out of business

717
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,239
it'll take some people and they'll lose

718
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:00,219
their jobs as a result of it and I

719
00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:01,450
believe eventually we're going to have

720
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,580
to have a different distribution model

721
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,399
for the way liability is shifted for

722
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,409
consumers and there has to be

723
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:10,239
responsibility for everybody from the

724
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:11,830
consumer all the way up to the car the

725
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,119
trans actors and the people in the

726
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,700
background that are managing it it is a

727
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,259
governance issue overall and we're

728
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,210
moving more towards a virtual identity

729
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,070
to where I believe near field

730
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,779
communications and our phone or mobile

731
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:27,549
devices are going to completely change

732
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:29,679
the way that we do things if you can do

733
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,999
it with your device why would you even

734
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:33,820
carry a card or cash to some degree but

735
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,589
of course you go to old world areas

736
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:37,599
you're going to still need cash in some

737
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:41,799
cases I think we'll have to wrap it up

738
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:45,490
there that is it okay thanks very much

739
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:50,559
[Applause]
