1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,349
good morning everybody welcome to the

2
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,910
very first red team red track talk I'm

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,670
Jeanette and I'm your conference chair

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,330
for this session I'm really pleased to

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,420
introduce our first speaker professor

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,689
and dr. eager music from Intel security

7
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,170
a great company if I must say so he's a

8
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,219
he's going to talk about economic

9
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,980
sanctions on malware and before he

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,899
starts I wanted to give you just a fun

11
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,489
fact a fun vb fact about Igor Igor has

12
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,329
been attending vb for 17 years and his

13
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,449
first talk was in 1995 and it was on

14
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,809
macro viruses so anyway join me in

15
00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:02,370
welcoming Igor and take it away thank

16
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,640
you thanks for coming into the Red Room

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,729
it looks very pretty and if I might run

18
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,460
a poll who thinks that the green room is

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,180
better please please raise your hand I

20
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,130
don't see any hands so it is officially

21
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,659
very pretty and with that let's start

22
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,909
what I want to talk to you about today

23
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,520
is we are all technologists we work in

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,100
computer security we build complex

25
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,850
systems and when we do that we don't

26
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,110
realize often that what we do I can be

27
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,860
done in several different ways so we

28
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,320
don't only solve technological problems

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,649
with technology that's what I'm driving

30
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,110
at and that's what my presentation today

31
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,340
is going to be about so who knows what

32
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,280
that plane on the screen is that's right

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,509
it is Lockheed built sr-71 supersonic

34
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:09,209
reconnaissance plane extremely expensive

35
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,530
beast it was built for

36
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,810
a 34 years from 6498 the 32 of these

37
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,510
planes built and the only reason they

38
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,670
were created was to provide good

39
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,680
surveillance data over the enemy

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,110
territory over the territory of the

41
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,290
Soviet Union to find the launch sites

42
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,870
and all that deployment of troops and

43
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,069
everything extremely costly program 35

44
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:41,459
million each aircraft four hundred

45
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,980
millions per year to sustain the whole

46
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,330
park of these aircrafts and the

47
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:54,200
technology was built to withstand a

48
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,630
technological problem if a messiah if a

49
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,459
missile is fired upon a jet it has to

50
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:04,680
deal with it the way this plane dealt

51
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
with it is accelerated it could do three

52
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,350
marks it flies faster than a bullet and

53
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,500
it just out runs the missile from all

54
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,690
the built airplanes not the single one

55
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,350
was ever shot down by an enemy fire a

56
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,500
little malfunction cells so the cost of

57
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,480
the entire program it's not officially

58
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,180
posted but I made calculations for lot

59
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,190
of the duration of the project that

60
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,450
built costs it's in the ballpark of 78

61
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,989
billion u.s. dollars which is not very

62
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:42,570
far from the cost of the Apollo mission

63
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,019
to land on the moon very expensive

64
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:51,180
solves the problem but there are other

65
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,410
ways so when you have an enemy another

66
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,040
way of dealing with this situation is to

67
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,560
change the ecosystem so after the Second

68
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,410
World War what United States were doing

69
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,980
for all the countries involved in the

70
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,380
conflict is pumping extremely high level

71
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,320
of funds into these countries and

72
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,519
unofficially it's called the marshall

73
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,769
plan officially european recovery

74
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,710
program and all countries were invited

75
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,550
to benefit from it in total 13 billion

76
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,389
dollars where

77
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:31,379
into it in post-war prices so a little

78
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:34,490
bit higher than the cost of building

79
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:40,319
sr-71 and that really did change the

80
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,930
whole ecosystem it brought a lot of

81
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:48,319
countries into the sphere of common

82
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:53,310
economical cooperation and the European

83
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,729
economies synchronized with the US

84
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,569
economy's and it created an amicable and

85
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:04,050
dynamic relationship and Germany was a

86
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,550
troublesome country before that it

87
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,889
started the first World War because it

88
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:09,719
was humiliated studied the second

89
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:12,810
Baldwin Marshall Plan did change that so

90
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,629
by employing economical measures you can

91
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:17,610
change the environment in such a way

92
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,960
that it becomes safer and that is what I

93
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,379
am going to talk to you about today for

94
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:27,689
computer security when we have a problem

95
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:31,800
like malware you don't need to just look

96
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,960
for technological solution let's look at

97
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,509
some alternatives and build ecosystems

98
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:40,069
in a safe way so that the bad players

99
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:42,870
would be punished and they would feel

100
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,939
economic pressure so we'll take a look

101
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:47,399
at the Causton rewards in the kind of

102
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,680
cyber crime area we'll look at the

103
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,460
technologies that can exert more

104
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,439
economic pressure and less economic

105
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,960
pressure and specifically look at four

106
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,529
different technologies one old digital

107
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,930
signatures also known as authentic Odin

108
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,279
windows another one which is new it's a

109
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,889
digital signing of software in mobile

110
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:14,849
ecosystems one which is emerging it's

111
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:18,000
pretty fresh but live I Triple E tagging

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,580
system for packed software and the final

113
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,189
one which is just the drawing board

114
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:27,360
stage is clean software alliance and if

115
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,310
you mind me saying before virus bulletin

116
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,580
there were two days of GSA meetings

117
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,669
right here in Prague to formalize how

118
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:37,409
the clean software alliance would work

119
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:41,350
and it is a record system where we

120
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,970
hoping to punish bad behaviors so the

121
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,760
problem that we are trying to solve is

122
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,980
technological internet it unbalanced

123
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,930
security the cost of intrusion is very

124
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,880
low you can do it across the borders you

125
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,930
can do it remotely to somebody's

126
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,510
machines and the rewards are high if you

127
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,660
happen to steal some sensitive data some

128
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,410
very costly secrets it's a lot of money

129
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:13,630
so the cost and reward balance is just

130
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,200
wrong we need to solve that and the way

131
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,060
to solve it is not just by pumping new

132
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,220
technology into our products into our

133
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,570
solutions we can do it in a different

134
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,020
way so if you have a problem the

135
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,630
simplest solution is to blacklist by

136
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:36,880
hash very cheap for anti-malware

137
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,840
companies probably even cheap of all the

138
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,680
bad guys to defeat you can do various

139
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,040
finger printing methods so it's a bit

140
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,570
harder for the bad guys to circumvent

141
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:54,160
but again not that difficult so to put a

142
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,690
little bit more pressure on that we can

143
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,450
look at behaviors of the software we can

144
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,460
look at distribution methods we can

145
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,540
block the mains URLs we can recognize

146
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,010
spam campaigns that carry malware it's a

147
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,350
bit more expensive for the bad guys to

148
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,500
change their domains because they have

149
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,230
to pay a little money for creating a new

150
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,440
domain they may have to hire a new

151
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,290
botnet to use the difference pump

152
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,480
campaign it is a little bit harder for

153
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,140
them but still not too much we can block

154
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,880
exploits that allow them penetrate

155
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,700
computers it is a little bit higher for

156
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:40,200
them to find new exploit but ultimately

157
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,490
what was found to be very effective

158
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:47,070
method is the reputation of developers

159
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,230
the software sources' software houses so

160
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,930
when we know that software came from

161
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,329
Microsoft if it's digitally signed

162
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:57,970
most of it antimalware companies would

163
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,610
implicitly trusted and they don't even

164
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,929
look further similar methods can be

165
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:07,989
applied to the identity of individual

166
00:09:07,989 --> 00:09:10,499
developers not just companies and

167
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:12,759
reputation can be built of individual

168
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,860
developers which can be done very

169
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:19,949
effectively in mobile ecosystems so

170
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:22,629
authentic code in Windows works very

171
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:25,089
well banking malware companies using it

172
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:30,279
a lot and the way to access it is to

173
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,199
right-click on any binary in Windows

174
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:35,589
then go into digital signatures and you

175
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:38,049
see something like that which is a

176
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:40,059
screenshot of an executable which tells

177
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:43,179
you the source the time when it was

178
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:46,480
created the signing time and the whole

179
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,160
chain of trust and you can drill into

180
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,379
the exact certificate and all that so

181
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:52,839
you have the origin of the program and

182
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,379
if that origin is not good which is not

183
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:59,709
the case for this particular binary you

184
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:02,649
can blacklist it that system became very

185
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:04,989
popular and key malware systems are

186
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:07,989
trusting digital signatures so naturally

187
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:10,509
the bad guys want to find the way around

188
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,790
it and it's not easy because they have

189
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,919
to steal credentials for signing

190
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:19,600
binaries nevertheless the numbers of

191
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,850
signed malware and other way are growing

192
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,860
and they actually pretty high that graph

193
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,790
shows how rapidly that problem was

194
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,319
accelerating once the bad guys

195
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:32,339
recognized the digital signing is

196
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,869
valuable property of executable they

197
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:38,199
started attacking it and current numbers

198
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:39,999
are exceeding 50 million of signed by

199
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,699
Nerys it's malware and also unwanted

200
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:46,749
software here the cost of such

201
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:51,069
certificate is 75 dollars per year and

202
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:55,119
don't mix it up with ssl certificates

203
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:57,040
which are twenty-five dollars per year

204
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,759
they actually the same but the

205
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,169
properties on the certificate are

206
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:06,329
slightly different so

207
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,800
this graph I borrowed from my colleagues

208
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,660
at bitdefender it was shown on a year

209
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,790
ago at virus bulletin and Seattle it's

210
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,380
showing the statistics of how often

211
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,130
malware is stealing certificates and

212
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,740
that's the way the bad guys attack the

213
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,930
problem if they are after certificates

214
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,500
they instructed them all way to steal

215
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,330
them delivered to them and then they can

216
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,460
use them for digital sign and quite a

217
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,890
lot of popular certificates were

218
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,620
compromised and compromise this way so

219
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,170
that's the response of malware guys we

220
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,150
can see that it's not easy for them and

221
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,770
there is no guarantee that they will

222
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,270
actually steal any particular

223
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,580
certificate that they are after it's

224
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,290
creating costs for them it's creating

225
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,330
delays for them so it puts some pressure

226
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,260
on them and it's a good thing so another

227
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,080
key system that I want to describe to

228
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,060
you is the mobile ecosystem and

229
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,210
developers in mobile ecosystems and

230
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,720
there are I would like to say three

231
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,450
different mobile ecosystem you normally

232
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:19,050
think about Apple's iOS and Google's

233
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,960
Android but in really the Android is

234
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,200
split one part of Android ecosystem is

235
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,610
google play which is tightly controlled

236
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,890
by google and another part of the

237
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,810
ecosystem in third-party markets which

238
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,790
is completely uncontrolled by google so

239
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,830
you can't say android as one ecosystem

240
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,960
there are actually two so in total we

241
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,470
have three obvious android and

242
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:43,770
uncontrolled android if you will in

243
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,320
Android ecosystem developers sign their

244
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,380
binaries submit to for example Google

245
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,530
Play and this is a self-signed but

246
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,260
because they are weighted by google it

247
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,930
essentially works as count to signature

248
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:02,940
by the root certificate the problem with

249
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,700
Android ecosystem is that because

250
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,130
software is free developers tend to

251
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,470
embed other libraries which generates a

252
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,840
little bit of money for them so the code

253
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,990
that the ship and sign contains often

254
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,579
some alien code which may be misbehaving

255
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:22,420
and often if developer is particularly

256
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,329
greedy they could bundle five or six of

257
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:29,100
these advertisement libraries which is

258
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,970
obviously not a good idea so the cost of

259
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,850
misbehavior in these three ecosystem in

260
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,350
iOS and Android and outside of Google

261
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,129
Play for Android is shown on this slide

262
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:48,489
and we see an interesting correlation in

263
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:51,309
areas the cost of misbehave is high it's

264
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:53,019
ninety-nine dollars that's how much a

265
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:55,499
developer pace to join the development

266
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:59,559
program for Apple and the malware

267
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:01,779
problem day is negligible there are some

268
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:04,389
attacks but they don't happen very often

269
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:07,749
in Google Play Developer pays

270
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:10,269
twenty-five dollars and the malware

271
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:13,569
problem there exists but it's under

272
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:17,980
control it's relatively low and in

273
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,290
third-party markets outside of control

274
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,179
van developers don't have to pay

275
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:25,209
anything the problem is very serious

276
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:28,329
there are infested marketplaces in fact

277
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:31,299
our own crawlers know that some

278
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:34,869
third-party markets are predominantly

279
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:39,220
used to host malware so that's a big

280
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,989
problem there and as you can see there

281
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:42,850
is reverse correlation between the cost

282
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,040
of misbehavior and the scale of malware

283
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,350
problem in these areas and what's nice

284
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,829
for malware developers in android is

285
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:52,809
that they can start outside of Google

286
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,679
Play and then when they feel confident

287
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:59,139
then they can upgrade themselves to

288
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:03,790
google play a little bit more but have a

289
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:09,549
much wider distribution so now let's

290
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:11,499
look at the puck malware problem and the

291
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:15,220
tagging system we know that malware is

292
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,410
comprised of at least sixty percent of

293
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,699
packed executables obfuscated it and

294
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:24,249
some packets are very difficult to look

295
00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:26,470
inside and to recognize something

296
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,889
generically to put more pressure on the

297
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:32,200
bad guys one needs to

298
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,740
do it quickly and effectively and it's

299
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,450
not possible to look inside these

300
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,720
obfuscating programs very quickly so

301
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,590
what we started is the tagging problem

302
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,270
many of you have heard about tagging but

303
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,620
for those who don't here is the

304
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,540
explanation from the wikipedia what the

305
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,700
tag antes it's a chemical mark often put

306
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,890
in explosives to track it to the factory

307
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,410
which helps infrared forensic forensic

308
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,740
investigation of for example terrorist

309
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:04,030
attacks when something blew up so the

310
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,370
tag and now we call it tagging to be one

311
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,510
was first conceived in nine in 2009-2010

312
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,240
by a group of security companies in I

313
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,500
Tripoli I CSG which stands for industry

314
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,410
connections security group it's a

315
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,710
digital signature blob attached to be

316
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,200
your dll it's all documented in previous

317
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,710
vb conferences so you can look it up in

318
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,050
more detail it carries information about

319
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,810
who packed the file what the packer is

320
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,090
what version and settings were used and

321
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,800
when the file was packed and it's a

322
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,640
trusted signature and it uses

323
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,350
cryptographically strong hash and

324
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:49,030
timestamp pki shirts are routed into I

325
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:52,570
Tripoli the system works like a typical

326
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,930
pki here rocky with I Tripoli root or

327
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,340
top on top so you have to put it upside

328
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,880
down to view it as a tree then there is

329
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,640
a shared CA which is issues certificates

330
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,800
to all the back row companies and these

331
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,839
are individual installations of Packers

332
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:14,619
when one of them is behaves or gets

333
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:18,130
compromised or touches to the stolen

334
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,880
credit card it gets blacklisted and

335
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,849
security companies can block it the

336
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:27,099
benefit for security companies is that

337
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:29,320
once they know of one particular case of

338
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,250
abuse then they can block everything

339
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,380
which comes from that source and the bad

340
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,930
guys will have to purchase another copy

341
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,820
or still another copy which puts some

342
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,580
pressure on them that's the idea about

343
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,100
the tagging system and how to change the

344
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,030
teco system

345
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,750
the system is live on that statistics

346
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,710
are coming from the sample database that

347
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,800
we keep at int'l security then covers

348
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,260
almost one year first numbers were very

349
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,720
low from the early takers and now it's

350
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,510
reaching about 10,000 per month which is

351
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,940
not a huge amount yet but it's growing

352
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,160
and the main sources are these four

353
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:15,490
packets with the help of guys from

354
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,980
virustotal we deployed recognition of

355
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,560
tagged nuns into virustotal so if you

356
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,960
have a file with the target if you

357
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,780
follow a file information tab you can

358
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,900
find the package details there and it

359
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,850
tells you whether the target block is

360
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,760
valid well the full file hash is valid

361
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,630
the peak eh in the type of packer when

362
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,280
it was time stamping whether it's

363
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,020
trusted the validity of the signature

364
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,000
for a particular user so the

365
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,980
installation specific installation of a

366
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,480
packer and they are all unique and they

367
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,400
all carry individual certificates and

368
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,400
the packet vendor which in this case is

369
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,320
enigma so you can use it and it's live

370
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,780
at virustotal for a couple of months now

371
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,450
the economics of tagging version one

372
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:08,110
system is that it hits the malware

373
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,860
industry economically they cannot use

374
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,720
evaluation versions anymore which are

375
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,490
free because we agreed with the packet

376
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,410
companies that these would be pre

377
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,480
blacklisted before they release a new

378
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,520
evaluation version they give us a

379
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,000
certificate using it be blacklisted so

380
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,830
software companies that want to use a

381
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,340
packer can run all the testing

382
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,660
compatibility testing but for production

383
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,610
use their supposed to purchase a proper

384
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,410
copy not the evaluation one because a

385
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:39,400
variation one to block that malware by

386
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,500
design otherwise there would be no

387
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,620
pressure on the bad guys and reputation

388
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,360
in this system can be built which also

389
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,060
helps put additional pressure on the bad

390
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,680
guys because then they would be also

391
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,740
interested in stealing credentials for

392
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,030
more reputable developers and their

393
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,160
installation of Packers which is harder

394
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,280
more expensive the system allows fine

395
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,910
grained control x files like we did in

396
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:10,000
the past by sources and you know when

397
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,770
that sauce produced a file through a

398
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,310
trusted timestamp and by types and pack

399
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:19,390
of versions the cool research of that

400
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,550
echo system was done by Professor Alan

401
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,160
aaron the ho ta in University of

402
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,870
Louisiana and here is the link if you

403
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,730
are interested also it in the paper in

404
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,780
the proceedings and now the fourth echo

405
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,390
system that will look at is the one

406
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,340
which is currently on the drawing board

407
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,020
it's software magnetization and

408
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,560
advertising also known as clean software

409
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,320
Alliance there is a lot of money in

410
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,320
software that rising and that's how much

411
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,450
money but software magnetization

412
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,410
ecosystem is smaller of course because

413
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,420
previous slide all included just digital

414
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,550
advertisements as well software do

415
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,860
adjustments a little bit less than that

416
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,930
but there are lots of smaller companies

417
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,590
that offer you free software and offer

418
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:12,430
you bundles and there are sometimes very

419
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,800
aggressive they want to install a tool

420
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,990
by and control your internet searches

421
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,960
and block the competitors and they do it

422
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,980
to various extent and that should be

423
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,790
regulated the problem with this space is

424
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,240
that the most aggressive players are not

425
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,390
getting punished and those who want to

426
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,090
abide by the rules have to compete with

427
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:42,060
them so the csa's goal was to create it

428
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:47,410
set of rules and establish them in this

429
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,750
ecosystem so that bad behaviour would be

430
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,040
punished the guidelines were created and

431
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,640
the technological support for checking

432
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,070
whether the guidelines are followed will

433
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,640
come from the new version of the tagging

434
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,110
system so called tag and v2 there are

435
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,880
lots of software types in this ecosystem

436
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,520
there are final installations that are

437
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,990
download

438
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,770
that includes several software packages

439
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,980
there are static ad advertisement

440
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,780
modules and also dynamic advertisement

441
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,050
modules including scripts and HTML lots

442
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:30,190
and lots of different things the problem

443
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,190
is that when you have a binary on the

444
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:36,309
end point at the end of all that chain

445
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:39,370
it's almost impossible to track it back

446
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,400
to the source and what we try to do with

447
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,460
the target version with two is to cover

448
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,710
all the use cases in this ecosystem and

449
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,470
even have some additional leeway for the

450
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:54,010
future to expand it on to other use

451
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:57,400
cases which I'll mention so the features

452
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,480
of the taggant v2 system is that it's an

453
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,720
extension of Yvonne it has a mechanism

454
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,720
to track the chain of custody over a

455
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,700
binary from a developer to a bundler to

456
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,820
download provider and whoever else is in

457
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,610
that chain you can put the first target

458
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,679
on the first step the second target on

459
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:22,990
the second step and like a stack of

460
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,750
pancakes they'll adapt because they just

461
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,960
append it at the end and it all works

462
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,510
and even works in conjunction with tar

463
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,840
going to be one another important thing

464
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,630
is that in each target you can include

465
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,150
the contributor list so if a developer

466
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:43,090
is creating a program and uses some

467
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,580
external libraries they can list which

468
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,910
particular software modules are used and

469
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,250
that would be contained within a target

470
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,650
and you can build reputations bait on

471
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,770
not just the whole binary but on its

472
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,980
elements and if it's properly described

473
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,290
in the target then you have ability to

474
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,820
fine-tune your reputation and trust

475
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,640
levels to the binary based on its

476
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,740
components the CSA bundle often comes

477
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,809
from many places so that's very

478
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:21,910
important for these kind of views also

479
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:25,330
GSA bundles contain scripts and often

480
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,490
these scripts come from the internet a

481
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:27,800
name

482
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:34,340
Nikoli and the new tag and v2 has an

483
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,960
ability to handle not just binary

484
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,090
objects but also textual objects script

485
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:42,550
objects htmls and things like even flash

486
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:46,970
pictures and additionally the

487
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,460
flexibility should allow us in near

488
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,520
future to expand and cover it cover the

489
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,460
apks for android installation packages

490
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,010
and cover the problem in android where

491
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,580
the developers code is mixed with the

492
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:06,890
advertisement library once that target

493
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,190
v2 is slapped onto a file and the idea

494
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:14,780
for csa is to have a central vetting

495
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,840
Authority which would put that full

496
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,360
taggant information onto the binary

497
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,800
resolve the metadata it would allow

498
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,950
attributing misbehavior the specific

499
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,060
person who misbehaved and that creates

500
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,130
economic pressure and significant

501
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,380
financial penalties for CSA members

502
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:41,980
should they choose to violate the rules

503
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,630
so in conclusion we looked at four

504
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,970
different ecosystems and there are many

505
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:50,750
more and obviously when you create in

506
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,500
you echo system you can put safeguards

507
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,420
which would make it very hard and very

508
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,850
expensive for the bad guys to break one

509
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,560
example is for example Microsoft Xbox

510
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,400
it's ridiculously difficult to break in

511
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,730
there were just the handful of proofs of

512
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,000
concept how to violate the security of

513
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,640
an Xbox and that's all the chief digital

514
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,130
signing full chain of trust from booting

515
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:24,730
to the operating system and PKA methods

516
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,620
trust and reputation are the most useful

517
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,140
mechanisms for putting the pressure on

518
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:35,990
the bad guys it would throttle must

519
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,240
produced malware and unwanted software

520
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,320
and regulate markets like

521
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,290
csa wants to regulate but unfortunately

522
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:48,100
it wouldn't help with

523
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,510
government-sponsored and targeted

524
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,100
malware because these guys are slightly

525
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,620
after different things cost for them is

526
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,520
a different matter they might even get

527
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,380
government funding which is potentially

528
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,330
unlimited I mean if we take an example

529
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,670
again returning to my first slide of

530
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,250
sr-71 the cost of the program was in

531
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:13,490
billions and that's how much governments

532
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:17,870
are willing to pay for learning secrets

533
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:26,150
of others our ecosystem methods built on

534
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,300
pki digital signatures trust reputation

535
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,730
I would help and I urge you when you get

536
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:35,170
involved in building new ecosystems like

537
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:39,800
Internet of Things or embedded devices

538
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,130
or aircraft software to think how to

539
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,350
build a system in such a way that the

540
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,960
cost of breaking it would be as high as

541
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,640
possible and that's all I had to say so

542
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,890
if you have any questions I guess over

543
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:00,530
to Jeanette yeah Thank You Igor are

544
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,660
there any questions for you Gor ok

545
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,620
please wait for the microphone

546
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,179
hello I would like to ask you a question

547
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:17,299
about the cost of misbehavior in case of

548
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:20,900
tag and because currently a buying

549
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,960
authentic of certifcate cost as few

550
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,150
shows somewhere around 2025 dollars and

551
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,320
that's another interesting thing that

552
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,320
many of this but certificates came from

553
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:38,360
one source and it's Komodo and I'm not a

554
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,510
question is what is the punishment for

555
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:45,860
that certificate authority which does

556
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:51,440
not follow some rules like checking the

557
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,120
ID of of the signer they want to issue

558
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,370
the SEC ticket ok in the tagging system

559
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:05,450
the question was how we make sure that

560
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,549
in the tagging system the cost is

561
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:14,240
effective so to speak currently it's

562
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,280
free for the bad guys to repack and

563
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,520
executable we put a non zero cost on it

564
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,950
so once they abuse a particular

565
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,660
installation they have to purchase

566
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,669
another one currently they just rerun

567
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:28,760
that Packer again so that's introducing

568
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,460
non zero cost and introduces a manual

569
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,590
action you have to go and purchase a

570
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:37,010
steal or move stolen certificate or

571
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,740
stolen credit cards into the new system

572
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,230
to purchase a new installation so that

573
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,290
introduces on non zero cost if a

574
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:48,230
particular pecker vendor is abusing the

575
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,820
system very often they will be of course

576
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,919
kicked out of the system and there is a

577
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,750
possibility technologically to block

578
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,179
blacklist everything that comes from

579
00:29:56,179 --> 00:30:00,020
that source not just user installations

580
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:04,030
but also the high level pack a provider

581
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:10,850
but we did not regulate how much the

582
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,030
pack event does have to charge their

583
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,250
users for the packing that might come

584
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,740
later if we see how the system operates

585
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:22,130
in real life were the cheaper Packers in

586
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,110
the tagging system are less effective

587
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,440
and

588
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,240
all attacked then the others it's gone

589
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,790
see you Christian thank you okay we're

590
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,160
at a time now so um will you join me in

591
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,910
thinking you go first
