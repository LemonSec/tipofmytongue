1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,720
okay good morning everyone I hope your

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,060
head you had a good time yesterday with

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,519
the choice of ROM and cheese and

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,639
everything and fully recovered today so

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,139
thanks for coming you are in a green

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,010
room we have a splendid session laid out

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,949
for you this morning and the first one

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,100
is the presentation from a very

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,900
interesting team which splits the

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,410
industry and academia and on the stage

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,969
we have one of the co-authors which is

12
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,750
stefan from fraunhofer University in

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,180
Germany but on the team also a couple of

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,879
my colleagues from mental security and

15
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,420
when I was reviewing this paper I

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,550
thought it was particularly interesting

17
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,710
so I was very pleased virus bulletin put

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,530
me as a moderator for this session so

19
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,309
without further ado Stefan over to you

20
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:02,100
and please welcome him ok hello welcome

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,040
for my talk as Igor said my name is

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,170
Stefan Hoover I'm from the front for

23
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,630
Institute for secure information

24
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,820
technology and today I want to speak

25
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,369
about some Android malware which is

26
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,820
abusing back end as a service for common

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,020
core for common communication command

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,350
and control communication over some

29
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,259
clouds I'm just the replacement speaker

30
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,750
for this project and therefore at first

31
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,299
want to introduce some person who do the

32
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,909
main work of the project so the lead and

33
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,909
the idea was from Siegfried rust over

34
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,820
he's a PhD student at the technical

35
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,509
university damn stat and tease his

36
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,820
research focus our static and dynamic

37
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,759
code analysis and he belongs to the

38
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,729
group of Professor button who is also

39
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,530
professor at the Technical University

40
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,159
and also the group leader for secure

41
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,990
software engineering at the fraunhofer

42
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,590
institute and as eager already said this

43
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,200
was a collaboration with Intel security

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,840
they're responsible analyst of the

45
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,150
application was Carlos Castillo

46
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:18,150
and he belongs to the group of Alex okay

47
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,849
how was this idea was born the idea was

48
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:24,760
born a few months ago when we discovered

49
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,819
a small implementation floor in a normal

50
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:30,670
Android application the application was

51
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,870
storing something traveling data in the

52
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,170
cloud or in the back analysis service

53
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,709
data storage and we were curious if

54
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:45,639
there are some other denying application

55
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:48,370
also containing the this implementation

56
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,970
floor and we decided to develop some

57
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,530
automatic analyze and try to find other

58
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,829
denying application so we analyzed

59
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:03,430
around 400,000 Android application it's

60
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,090
around one third of the current android

61
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,030
or google play store and there we this

62
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,120
due to this implementation flaw we could

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,819
access to around fifty six million

64
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,349
back-end data is considering of

65
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:22,780
different information more details about

66
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,169
this floor and attack you will be

67
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:28,480
published in a few months at the black

68
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,930
hat and the next step was on one side we

69
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,449
want to test how good our analyzes and

70
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:37,659
we thought also to put or analyze

71
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:40,329
smuggler applications because mother

72
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,819
application are a more higher challenge

73
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:44,799
for automatic analysis due to

74
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,620
application and so on this was the first

75
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,959
thing and the other thing was when we

76
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:52,030
can access the back end of the malware

77
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,269
which kind of data will be find at the

78
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:58,750
back end to can be find some SMS

79
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,120
information banking or the common in

80
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,269
control and so on as I already mentioned

81
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:06,879
I think back end as a service is nothing

82
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,169
new for you it's just infrastructure

83
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,060
provided by some companies like

84
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,620
databases or administration in our study

85
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,089
we considered currently three famous

86
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,830
back end provider the first one was

87
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,710
parse parsed now belongs to face

88
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,630
look the Amazon Web Services and cloud

89
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,139
mine some interesting services for the

90
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:38,380
app developer odd push notification they

91
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,440
also provide back-end like for data

92
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,860
storage databases or file system you

93
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,639
also can handle user administration or

94
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,949
build interfaces for social network

95
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:54,580
integration the first two features are

96
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,160
for our purpose the most interesting

97
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,860
because when the push notification you

98
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,560
can send messages directly to the

99
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,810
smartphone or to the application and the

100
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,150
data storage as the name says provides

101
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,050
the backend for storing the data okay

102
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,759
how can this back-end be used and where

103
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,150
is the implementation floor the most

104
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,710
authors or the most failure for use for

105
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,069
example this back-end you have only 33

106
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:29,430
comments at first you have to initialize

107
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,849
the API then you can create a new table

108
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:36,699
in this case it's called intercepted SMS

109
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:39,639
and then you can use the key value

110
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,719
system to store your information the big

111
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:44,680
misunderstanding or the problem is now

112
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,449
the application ID and the client ID are

113
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,280
hard-coded in the application for

114
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,070
communicating with the backend and this

115
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,430
this is not a real out indication so you

116
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,849
can imagine the author store their

117
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:02,289
authentication credentials hard-coded in

118
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:04,449
the application so if you can extract

119
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:06,759
this information you have full access to

120
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:09,210
the database in the back end because

121
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:14,169
they do not proper access control on the

122
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:17,320
server the one first problem is the the

123
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,479
provider of this back and provide these

124
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,570
features but if you read the instruction

125
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,210
tutorials you always have only three

126
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,400
steps these are the three steps you see

127
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,710
and nobody thinks about the consequence

128
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:35,620
or security so as I already mentioned we

129
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,710
developed some some analyzer to detect

130
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,650
this implementation floor and I first

131
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,779
give a short overview how this is

132
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:47,110
working at the input as you can see you

133
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,289
have the APK files we want to analyze at

134
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:51,820
first we do some some lightweight

135
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,310
library detection to filter out all

136
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,300
application which do not contain any API

137
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,570
calls or library to to communicate with

138
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,419
the backend then the second step is the

139
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:07,029
most important step is to try to extract

140
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:09,339
the keys automatically this extraction

141
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:11,560
phase is separated in a static and

142
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,260
dynamic face and the static face can be

143
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,740
also separated in two phases the first

144
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,159
step we just do some simple constant

145
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:24,969
propagation to the to the initialized

146
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:28,240
method to find if the keys are constant

147
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,089
defined if there are the keys define us

148
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,250
some constant the analyzing is done

149
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,740
because we have the key values but

150
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,630
they're also especially malware there's

151
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,789
some some kind of obfuscation or the

152
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:43,080
keys dynamically generated for example

153
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,729
encoded in a byte array or the different

154
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:48,190
characters are connected during run time

155
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,690
and at this problem normal static

156
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,180
analyzed fails so the second phase of

157
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,029
the static analyze is some some slicer

158
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:01,870
the slice of just extracts dependent

159
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,930
code for this API call and then the

160
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,229
extracted code will be injected in some

161
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:10,960
runtime environment the advantages now

162
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,270
we can reach code coverage because

163
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,800
normally if you want to dynamically

164
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,750
analyze something you always have to

165
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,089
consider external influence for example

166
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:20,889
is there a button do I have to click the

167
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:22,960
button one time to time is there some

168
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,620
combination is there some timer or some

169
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,320
special condition this this how can I

170
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,110
say code rubbish is all thrown away so

171
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,360
we just have the core responsible for

172
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,339
the past communication for example and

173
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:39,039
then the appliques code part is executed

174
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,529
and we can extract during the run time

175
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:45,370
the this features in the next step we

176
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,560
also with the same technique technic try

177
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,199
to extract the table name merge this and

178
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:50,980
some

179
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,010
recorded some exploit generator and then

180
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,339
we have some client or application which

181
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:00,490
can automatically try to connect to the

182
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,560
database so now I want to go a bit more

183
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,010
in detail to the malware aspect here we

184
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,110
found some malware using the face

185
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,639
Facebook sparse back-end infrastructure

186
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,120
we got around 300,000 malware apps from

187
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,230
from Intel security doing our analyzes

188
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:28,180
and we found around 80 apps which abuse

189
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,290
the push notification 16 application

190
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,420
using the data storage and five of this

191
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,440
are where the Android up fake malvar for

192
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,310
where android marry variants and we

193
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,459
extracted from the five up fake variants

194
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:51,699
five pars accounts with this accounts we

195
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:53,860
make further or more detailed analyzes

196
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,459
which will explain a bit later and for

197
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:59,980
this analyzes we extracted three common

198
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,500
tables and these three common tables are

199
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,260
the core point of the common in control

200
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,100
communication ok at first I would give a

201
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,959
coarse grain of a few how the

202
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,600
application or the malware internally is

203
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,819
working the app itself is just will be

204
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,579
executed and launches some some service

205
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,380
then it hides the icon and this was the

206
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,769
whole process then the application will

207
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:29,980
react on different external events like

208
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,920
if the phone is ringing or if the boot

209
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,089
process is completed and we'll save some

210
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:40,660
common in control URL and then execute

211
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,990
those ports and background tasks the

212
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,980
application has then subscribe or login

213
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,360
to the parsed back-end and sends some

214
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,190
push notification that the application

215
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,209
is let's say online with some

216
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:01,060
inflammation and then it saved some

217
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,220
additional install information and

218
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,600
also i canna say the applique and mother

219
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,939
uses to communication ladies it was a

220
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:12,550
Mexican action to start playing

221
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,620
commenting control server in this case

222
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,180
an approver this context we will

223
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,680
currently ignoring this talk okay and

224
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,980
then it reduces some together system

225
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,199
this is something like a scheduled task

226
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:32,980
which will be called every X minutes to

227
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:38,800
do to handle stunning okay as I said is

228
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,110
this system alert will be executed every

229
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,230
minute and if prescribe to establish the

230
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,740
communication to it as I said Jane

231
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,589
command control back and the other

232
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:54,699
option is now losing the part again that

233
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:58,149
we have first table stainless called new

234
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:01,620
tasks and this new task table works as a

235
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,529
kind of comment interface so and the

236
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:07,449
comment which should be sent to the

237
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:11,490
lower it's just restored in this table

238
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:16,600
so the processed of the plane back and

239
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,670
concealer love you I will not invite or

240
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,029
polished and this term interactionist

241
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:28,629
yes the subset of the other branches we

242
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:32,709
handle the post communication so the

243
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:36,040
first application drives to the other

244
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,100
device ID with the manacles the UI works

245
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,829
as the unique identifier or you can see

246
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:44,769
as the primary key in the comment again

247
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:48,129
so it looks ok looks for the email of

248
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:49,930
the device in the table and says okay

249
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,600
for this ID is a comment so okay I can

250
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,610
receive the corresponding component

251
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,180
executed so as I steadiest comment

252
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,129
matches there will be executed a new

253
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:03,550
task when the task will be executed the

254
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,730
the the execution of the task will be

255
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,220
saved in a new table this kids new table

256
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,800
is called task manager table you can see

257
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,829
this table as a kind of response so as I

258
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:16,400
said the new tasks

259
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,920
will be the comment stand and the task

260
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,140
manager will be the result or risk

261
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:26,060
response of the new task how can the

262
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,290
different task look like at first

263
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,120
there's some some interception function

264
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,070
if this interception function is turned

265
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,540
off and every SMS which is sent from the

266
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,060
device or received from the device can

267
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,850
be intercepted or it dropped and will be

268
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,400
also stored in the back end as an

269
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,320
additional table this is called as the

270
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,690
net received and in this parse back end

271
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:54,980
table the received SMS are stored we

272
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,080
also get accepted this table and later

273
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,180
but they'll get later in detail here you

274
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,130
see an overview of the different tasks

275
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,560
and functionality the mother can do as I

276
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,190
already said it can intercept SMS but it

277
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,620
also can send SMS for example for

278
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,050
providing or distributing the malware or

279
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,510
doing some smishing attacks you can send

280
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,050
us SD codes you can also provide some

281
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,600
fake us to the browser you also can

282
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,170
install new application we also observed

283
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,170
that the up fake will install a new

284
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,200
variant called the merry variant for the

285
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,050
install process are also two ways on the

286
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,050
first way would be just using the plane

287
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,000
Android installer the other way will be

288
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,330
check if the device is rooted and if

289
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,400
there are root privileges the app tries

290
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,630
to install it with the hidden install

291
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:55,280
process another important point is if an

292
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,830
task will be is executed or a comment

293
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,290
and written to the new task table it

294
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,690
will be deleted so this is like a

295
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,290
comment queue so else you would land in

296
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,930
a deadlock because the new command is

297
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,890
not removed from the common queue as i

298
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,420
already said there's also some

299
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,960
functionality for intercepting SMS

300
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,360
messages here you see that the back end

301
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,020
handling for the SMS as i said the

302
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,410
received messages are handling two ways

303
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,920
on the one side they are stored in our

304
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,370
in the back end in the SMS receiver

305
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,579
table and they also send it via possum

306
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:44,170
and push message yeah here and the next

307
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,139
step and I tried to explain that the

308
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:49,899
different database schemes or you also

309
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:54,130
can see or can can interpret us the

310
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,639
command command and control protocol so

311
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:00,699
for as I said the new task record just

312
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:03,490
is separated in the am I in a task

313
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,579
column the last three columns the object

314
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:08,470
ID created and updated our default

315
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,139
columns always created by by the pars

316
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:13,810
back end and the tasks as I already

317
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,089
mentioned can be separated in the SMS

318
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:19,240
task intercepting task providing new

319
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,639
server UL for common in control or

320
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:27,010
installing new applications here are now

321
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,560
a few statistics because as we because

322
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,529
we had access to this parts back end we

323
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:34,839
could download the table and table

324
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,660
structure is some very easy to analyze

325
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,540
and to evaluate the thin and let's say

326
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,350
axle and to get statistics be considered

327
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,100
the five accounts meant named a two E

328
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,430
and there you can see a number of

329
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,579
different task the interesting thing is

330
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:57,010
now in if you look at the count d there

331
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,640
is nearly no task this is because i'm as

332
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,860
i already said the new tasks is there

333
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,740
the comment comment q where the new

334
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,990
comments are provided and if the comment

335
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:12,030
would be executed its removed from the

336
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,829
from from this table and written in the

337
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,679
other table so you can see account a B

338
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,980
and C and E have a lot of comments in

339
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,179
the Q and a county already has processed

340
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:30,390
or the comments you are for example some

341
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,610
samples how such a comment can look for

342
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,640
example for for the SMS the the first

343
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,750
example is or says if if the device

344
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,990
receives an

345
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,110
SMS for example containing or the number

346
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,280
nine hundred with the content balance

347
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,020
intercept this SMS and store the copy

348
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,530
this is for this belongs to some Russian

349
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,370
bank which we where you can make your

350
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,800
bank account balance requests or they

351
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,220
also some commandos which will try to

352
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,350
steal credit cards they are implemented

353
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,150
with some regular expression this means

354
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,030
if there's an SMS sent from this number

355
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,610
containing a credit card number store

356
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,160
the credit card number or the intercept

357
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,309
command as I said just activate sir

358
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:22,720
enables or disables the interception

359
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,230
here is a command or two to provide new

360
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,520
command and control server or also to

361
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,850
[Music]

362
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,900
install new applications on the device

363
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,260
we also made a statistic about the

364
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,860
distribution over the time because as

365
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,380
you saw in the table scheme in the

366
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,790
previous table scheme there's always

367
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,040
stored the date when the entry is made

368
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,830
and there you can see the increasing

369
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,890
amount of the different distribution and

370
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,770
here is the scheme for the received SMS

371
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,540
you can see it the first the body the

372
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,020
body is just that the content of the SMS

373
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,260
which will be or which was intercepted

374
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,920
then from this is the origin the origin

375
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,270
then the entire classifieds if it was an

376
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,090
incoming or outgoing SMS the receiver

377
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,910
there's also an option especially for

378
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,980
for credit card if it's enabled it will

379
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,650
pass the message for credit card numbers

380
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,980
and there's also some type which

381
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,040
currently our are they Carlos the

382
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,770
analyst says it has two two different

383
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:43,220
types other and service here are a few

384
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,190
samples or numbers about the received

385
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,190
SMS we get got from the from the back

386
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:54,440
end yeah I think they're self explaining

387
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,200
here are some some credit card numbers

388
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,850
we found and here this is the other

389
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:06,200
table this is the the opposite of the

390
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,850
first table here you see now the task

391
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,399
manager or the executed comments and you

392
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:13,639
as you can see a county has executed all

393
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:20,210
its received comments these are for

394
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,570
example then the result of executed

395
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,490
comments so for example the beginning we

396
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,139
had the comment peace intercept the

397
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:29,570
number nine hundred here then you get

398
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,269
the result for the number nine hundred

399
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:35,659
here it's this Burbank or four for

400
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:38,720
unaccompanied megaphone or the results

401
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,960
of some smishing attacks the SMS sent to

402
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,029
someone containing some some UL for

403
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:52,250
distributing the malware here we found a

404
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,620
depending of the target phone numbers we

405
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,379
had a small statistic about targeted

406
00:20:57,379 --> 00:21:00,110
companies they said there's some bank

407
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,720
also you find some telephone providers

408
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,210
and some other banks and it also was

409
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,519
interesting because as I said the email

410
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,860
or the unique ID of the device works as

411
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,080
primary key in the common structure so

412
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,379
we just counted the this distinguished

413
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:20,720
or the unique IDs and get a number of

414
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,389
and can get very easy a number of other

415
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:27,350
infected devices adjusted mention the

416
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,029
most infected devices were in the

417
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:33,440
Russian area the last thing was now the

418
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,590
responsible disclosure colleague said I

419
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,929
should say something about it because it

420
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:41,360
was a bit of funny because as I said

421
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,789
parce belongs to Facebook so we try to

422
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:47,330
contact Facebook and to announce our

423
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,970
findings and that they should made any

424
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,429
countermeasures and the first reaction

425
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:53,960
just when we announced it the first

426
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,250
reaction was you don't get any money

427
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,470
from us this is not a bad party we just

428
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,450
said we don't want any any money we just

429
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,970
want to announce the problem after that

430
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,399
they asked for more details then the

431
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:07,030
responsible disclosure was AK the fun

432
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,740
thing is now we had first tried it by

433
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,990
email but you can do you cannot do this

434
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,610
with facebook if you want to announce

435
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,100
something to facebook you have to be you

436
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,810
need a Facebook account and send a

437
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,330
facebook message also the response of

438
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:23,470
the information and the whole

439
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,600
communication is only done by Facebook

440
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,870
messaging and if you now have some

441
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,300
critical information I don't know if you

442
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,910
can include any PHP or s monkeys and

443
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,090
Facebook message service but I think

444
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,640
this is not the best way to do

445
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,600
responsible disclosure processes

446
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,960
conclusion yeah this this Trojan was

447
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,780
especially targeted for Eastern Europe

448
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,820
banks the problem of security a problem

449
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,400
is not just considering denying apps

450
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,840
also mother or authors make or have

451
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,570
failures and the other problem is now

452
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,700
when the sensitive informations are

453
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,650
stored in the back end as i showed the

454
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,960
credentials are hard-coded so also this

455
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,470
stolen information are just public

456
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,680
available so you don't have need any

457
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,080
special hacking skills or something you

458
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,290
just can take out the credentials and

459
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:29,500
have access to two other informations

460
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:35,170
the cyber crimes still if there are some

461
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,050
further detailed questions and i have

462
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:42,280
also put the contact information for the

463
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:48,160
leader of the project so feel free if i

464
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,410
can answer their questions i also yeah

465
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,880
that's all thank you for a attention

466
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,170
thank you Stefan

467
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:02,489
we have a few minutes for questions so

468
00:24:02,489 --> 00:24:05,070
if you have any please far away raise

469
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:11,940
your hand actually I had one you looked

470
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,169
at these accounts in malware yeah

471
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:18,779
wouldn't it be interesting to also draw

472
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:21,359
all the benign applications and see if

473
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,539
developers exposed their access

474
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:26,940
credentials there and lick some privacy

475
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,669
data outside of malware yet field did

476
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:30,989
you have any plans like that is it

477
00:24:30,989 --> 00:24:33,239
really possible we already have done it

478
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:36,539
and this will be proposed by siegfrid at

479
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:39,989
the black hat there will be thinking

480
00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:41,759
next month or so will be black head

481
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:44,899
Europe and he will talk about this topic

482
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:47,639
on the black head because there it's

483
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:49,969
more critical as I said we found

484
00:24:49,969 --> 00:24:53,460
millions of public available sensitive

485
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,759
informations also don't know personal

486
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:00,599
data also had health information just

487
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,539
some traveling information credit card

488
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:09,149
numbers the pictures of people from how

489
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:13,440
they called partner services and yeah a

490
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,029
lot a lot of stuff okay there is a

491
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:21,119
question here in the middle please wait

492
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,509
for the microphone

493
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:28,009
thanks for your presentation enjoyed it

494
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:30,379
do you have any theories as to why

495
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:33,769
certain regions of banks were targeted

496
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:37,789
in your findings Eastern European why

497
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:40,819
there oh this is a good question why

498
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:44,659
there I think that are the main target

499
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:47,989
is always the SMS banking process I

500
00:25:47,989 --> 00:25:50,149
think there how can I say you're doing

501
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:52,989
your banking business doing by SMS

502
00:25:52,989 --> 00:25:55,849
checking your your account balance doing

503
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:57,969
credit card transfer is done there

504
00:25:57,969 --> 00:26:01,639
everything by SMS and so I think this is

505
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:05,479
a reliable target and we also made some

506
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:07,819
coarse grained language analyzes with

507
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:13,819
some script about the SMS text and so we

508
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:18,459
found out that the the main region was

509
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:22,249
the Russian area also the targeted banks

510
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,699
I don't know them but I assume or the

511
00:26:25,699 --> 00:26:28,189
analyst says they're more settled in in

512
00:26:28,189 --> 00:26:30,589
the Russian areas we found a few or

513
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,249
other SMS keeping in Chinese or also in

514
00:26:34,249 --> 00:26:37,129
English but this was just some hello how

515
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:39,259
are you are you do you have some time

516
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:45,079
today or something in like that any more

517
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:47,529
questions

518
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,520
okay if none then thanks again to Stefan

519
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,620
thank you
