1
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:08,309
okay so continuing our ubiquitous theme

2
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:09,510
this morning we're going to hear some

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,820
more about the Internet of Things from

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,929
Jasmine so so thank you good morning

5
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:17,630
everyone and welcome to our presentation

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,680
I'm going to be talking about malware

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,590
security and the Internet of Things so

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,390
we realized that by selecting to look at

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,650
this subject we're contributing to

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,750
already substantial buzz and hype that

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,949
surrounds anything to do with the

12
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,050
Internet of Things and this is a bit of

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,059
a problem it was a problem for us

14
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,440
because it was a lot of information out

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,969
there to sort through and it's being

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,370
generated continuously it's also a

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,719
problem because it's hard to tell fact

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,440
from fiction when it comes to the IOT

19
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,079
the overabundance of information on this

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,610
topic also encourages a level of fatigue

21
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,800
in the audience this is unfortunate

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,420
because we're speaking about a topic

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,600
where much of the hyperbole is warranted

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,379
however the security and privacy

25
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,210
concerns as serious as they arise from

26
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,100
both its intended functionality and its

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,710
implementation whether the future we

28
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,420
were looking at will look more like

29
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,430
orbitz city from the Jetsons or Gotham

30
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,750
City from the Dark Knight is yet to be

31
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:14,430
determined so just imagine the drive

32
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,830
home from work today was a breeze thanks

33
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,150
to smart sensors and traffic flow

34
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,920
optimization traffic jams have become a

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,780
thing of the past there was some

36
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,280
construction on Main Street but the car

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,439
took you on a different route the street

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,880
stroke you drive down more clean and

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,860
green the census the city uses to

40
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,960
monitor the state of the street seems to

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,420
be working really really well you arrive

42
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,640
home your gates open they'll let you

43
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,040
pass through the lights are run is step

44
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,750
inside if you're warm and you catch a

45
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,880
few bars of your favorite song you can

46
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,439
smell freshly baked bread coming from

47
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,659
the kitchen your watch reminds you to

48
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,070
start your workout before dinner and

49
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,750
automatically checks your heart rate and

50
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,420
your blood pressure you get changed you

51
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,040
want to either to the gym it's a little

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,420
bit cooler there and the music rises to

53
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,829
something more appropriate for a workout

54
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,649
as you start your program your monitor

55
00:01:58,649 --> 00:01:59,909
notes that the joint on your left knee

56
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,590
isn't working properly and that the

57
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,030
synthetic joint will need to be replaced

58
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,820
soon checking the monitor again it might

59
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,580
be time to look that in afterwards you

60
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,649
ready to eat dinner and relax you notice

61
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,150
earlier that your toothbrush was flat

62
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,980
in the bathroom it must be time for a

63
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,299
new one and you see that it's already

64
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:16,739
been added to the automatic shopping

65
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,870
list on your fridge you never seem to

66
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,610
run other things anymore and you always

67
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,769
seem to have exactly what you need your

68
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:25,200
foods fresh your plants are alive your

69
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,239
pets been fed and your car is safe and

70
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,459
have these energy efficient and it's a

71
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:37,439
sanctuary life's good but what is it

72
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,540
really essentially it's an increasing

73
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,159
virtualization of the objects that make

74
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:43,319
up our physical reality while the

75
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,329
concepts of ubiquitous computing have

76
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:47,579
long been around the phrase Internet of

77
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,170
Things was first coined over 15 years

78
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,720
ago the interest in the IOT has recently

79
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,209
reached critical point the utopian

80
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,700
promise of the IOT is that with accurate

81
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,980
detailed wide ranging data captured from

82
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,420
the physical world valuable it is

83
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,939
computing we can take a huge game in

84
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:04,859
efficiency and effectiveness and reduce

85
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:07,859
the wastage of scarce resources we can

86
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:09,720
make increasingly accurate predictions

87
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,060
and we can make life better of those who

88
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,079
can afford it anyway but what does that

89
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,720
mean the estimated number of objects

90
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,340
that will be connected by 2020 keeps

91
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,870
rising with the figure varying

92
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,459
considerably depending on the source

93
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,129
from 20 billion to 200 million the time

94
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:29,459
we wrote the paper possible applications

95
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,530
range from manufacturing to healthcare

96
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,299
from managing your house to managing

97
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:35,400
entire cities a convergence of

98
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,079
affordable enabling technologies in

99
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:39,120
computing sensing networking and storage

100
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,989
not to mention ipv6 means the sky's the

101
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,370
limit when it comes to possible

102
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,319
applications of the technology from the

103
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,409
Magnificent to the Monday the impact for

104
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:50,970
industry is involved are also

105
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,739
particularly significant and they're

106
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,209
expected to be a considerable driver

107
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,409
feck anomic activity and development but

108
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:01,199
there's a dark side to so again just

109
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,419
imagine you drive home from work was a

110
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:05,760
bit of a nightmare the traffic was okay

111
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,290
but the current system I'm taking you

112
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,760
home along streets lined with digital

113
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,859
advertising boards or flashing up with

114
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:12,329
ads for brands and companies that you

115
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:15,060
use just like the internet but worse

116
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,399
because it follows you around you really

117
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,159
hope your car doesn't have spyware the

118
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,169
ones for personal services the ads were

119
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:23,860
particularly embarrassing

120
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,030
you hope the cars behind you didn't

121
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,979
notice thank God the kids weren't in the

122
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:29,680
car you arrived home and while the

123
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,969
lights and heading have turned on to

124
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:32,770
welcome you the kids have left a huge

125
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,300
mess and a note something about

126
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,360
ransomware on the TV sometimes you

127
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,319
really wish the family didn't know

128
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,689
exactly where you where all the time

129
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:41,469
privacy just doesn't seem to exist

130
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:43,930
anymore you're hungry but the fridge

131
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,919
won't open until you've done your

132
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,289
exercise so into the gym for a quick run

133
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:49,689
as you start your program the monitor

134
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,189
notes that the joint on your left knee

135
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:53,889
isn't working properly you had a knee

136
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:55,449
reconstruction a few years ago and the

137
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,069
synthetic joint will need replacing soon

138
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:59,319
looking at the monitor you see a note

139
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,300
from your health insurer they've noticed

140
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,099
you need as well as I've increased your

141
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:08,680
premiums as a result Parker so what's

142
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,279
the problem as we already know the iits

143
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,289
and omnipresent mix of billions of IP

144
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:16,270
connected embedded objects smart devices

145
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,069
and sensors with website with web

146
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:20,800
services and software in between the key

147
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,430
features a complexity heterogeneity and

148
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,870
but note also that the objects in the

149
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,969
i.t are often both widely distributed

150
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:29,949
and highly constrained with regard to

151
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:33,849
energy memory and processing in the iot

152
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:35,800
objects only need enough resources and

153
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,389
functionality to complete their very

154
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:40,120
particular objectives for example data

155
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,139
collection transmission and processing

156
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,819
the security challenges of the IOT rise

157
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:47,889
out of these functional and conceptual

158
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,889
characteristics ning view and yang group

159
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:52,210
these obstacles of confidentiality

160
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,610
integrity and availability into three

161
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,729
main areas scope dinama City and

162
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:00,789
heterogeneity we've expanded on this

163
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:01,750
framework to explore these

164
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,279
characteristics in their intersection

165
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,710
with security and additional detail the

166
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,240
potential scope of the IOT is

167
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,150
mind-boggling as mentioned earlier the

168
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,099
closer we get to adoption and the more

169
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:16,839
applications we envision envisage for

170
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,789
the technology the more the projected

171
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:21,789
numbers of objects rise the scope is

172
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:23,080
beyond anything we've ever seen before

173
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,089
and it's certainly beyond the capacity

174
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:27,490
of mere humans to manage so the use of

175
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,469
automation will be necessary essential

176
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:32,740
even it also has the potential for

177
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,280
multiple points of failure and

178
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,380
that necessitates significant redundancy

179
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,170
fault awareness and tolerance it's not

180
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,300
inconceivable for proposed solutions to

181
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,010
need to scale to at least billions of

182
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,070
objects and of course it's not just the

183
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,720
number of objects but the amount of data

184
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,190
that would be collected and transmitted

185
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:58,250
the required diner masa d of the IOT

186
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,930
brings issues as well and is a

187
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,370
significant challenge on some of our

188
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,880
current concepts of ICT security objects

189
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,680
in the IOT need to be able to interact

190
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,720
with many different things at many

191
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,970
different times one of the beauties of

192
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,919
the proposed IOT comes with its ability

193
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:15,110
to gather data and react in real time to

194
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,780
changing conditions however when we

195
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,490
think of security communications on the

196
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,800
internet today we often think of secure

197
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,390
endpoints with secure point-to-point

198
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,330
communication in between so trust exists

199
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,100
while a secure client has a secure

200
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,470
connection to a secure server but it's

201
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,770
gone the minute that connections over

202
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,270
but the IOT is not a connection-oriented

203
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,340
system and many current security

204
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,020
protocols and our connection oriented

205
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,760
this brings into question their

206
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,940
applicability in this area even though

207
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,410
there are arguments for continuing to

208
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,330
use a centralized cloud centric approach

209
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,450
for IOT making management data

210
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,370
processing and physical security easier

211
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,560
a peer-to-peer approach is more in line

212
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,680
with the IOT conceptually the third

213
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,690
major obstacle is posed by the

214
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,490
heterogeneity of systems that comprise

215
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,590
the IOT while there have been some

216
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,940
efforts with regards to implementing

217
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,039
standards such as work done by the group

218
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:12,470
of companies in the open interconnect

219
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,450
consortium and the industrial internet

220
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,120
consortium the IOT essentially consists

221
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,260
of a lot of different technologies

222
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,120
cobbled together in ways that were not

223
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,340
necessarily intended that may introduce

224
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,210
gaps to produce leakage or worse the

225
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,590
rush to market and the pressure to keep

226
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,150
costs down is seeing different

227
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,100
technologies repurposed and being used

228
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,679
together in unexpected ways without

229
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,719
working standards the connections

230
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,559
between them are less than seamless even

231
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,179
actually determining what's in the stack

232
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:43,280
and what vulnerabilities are in play not

233
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,839
necessarily is not necessarily an easy

234
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:47,420
question to answer

235
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,889
and of course if you can determine

236
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:50,720
exactly what technology is in use and

237
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,639
what may be vulnerable that doesn't mean

238
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,700
that patching is even viable the highly

239
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,350
constrained nature of objects in the IOT

240
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,060
means that some components will remain

241
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,279
vulnerable indefinitely and that

242
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,660
traditional solutions to security

243
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,800
problems may not even be possible

244
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:14,029
privacy concerns in this context warrant

245
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:16,250
special consideration the amount of data

246
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,959
being gathered will be on a scale we've

247
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:20,089
not yet seen but it's really the types

248
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:21,440
of data being gathered that pose a

249
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,839
bigger concern healthcare data is

250
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,940
already a valuable commodity and then

251
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,220
maybe there are recent examples from the

252
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,620
wild and it's targeting and misuse but

253
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,540
there'll be much more of it and it will

254
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,810
be much harder to protect in the IOT and

255
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,220
the very notion of ubiquity offers

256
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,410
further problems even if you don't want

257
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,180
to be a part of the IOT without a type

258
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,160
of personal cloaking device how could

259
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,510
you possibly escape from having your

260
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,220
personal information monitored recorded

261
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,540
and stored when there are sensors I'm

262
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,470
going to present in your environment

263
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,640
addressing privacy concerns is going to

264
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,440
require a particularly special effort

265
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,089
and people across the board will need

266
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:57,740
tools information and support to

267
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,350
understand what's at stake to know who

268
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,600
has their data and realize how it's

269
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,540
being used they'll also need to manage

270
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,490
their own data and determine access to

271
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:13,100
it as they see fit so a lot of people

272
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,810
are talking about this and a lot of

273
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,209
people are thinking about this so we

274
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:18,380
reference here a public service

275
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,240
announcement from the FBI published on

276
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,060
the tenth of sep tember this year just

277
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,410
the fact of the FBI is making these

278
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,199
kinds of public service announcements

279
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:28,699
speak volumes about the some of the

280
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:30,500
challenges that we face in security via

281
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,100
the IOT the human challenge what we take

282
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,690
from this is the scale of the human

283
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,760
problem and the need to drive user

284
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,829
education we're all familiar with how

285
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:41,449
the problem we're all familiar with the

286
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:43,310
problem that presents as we know

287
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,589
educating the user poses one of the most

288
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:47,209
difficult challenges that we face in the

289
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:50,930
I attained in the in AV industry if we

290
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,110
consider IOT connected devices just to

291
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,519
reduce the risk of compromise we're

292
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,529
relying on uses to reset default

293
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:59,480
passwords under Isis with low or no

294
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,360
interface

295
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,000
and keep those devices up-to-date I mean

296
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,320
how often do you think you might update

297
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,730
your heating system or your light bulbs

298
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,579
there's a great deal of time and money

299
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,200
being spent on talking about what we can

300
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,079
do to secure the itec iot but as yet not

301
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,310
a whole lot of action being taken to

302
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,160
actually do this what we do have is

303
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,420
agreement about the approaches that we

304
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,149
ought to take to secure the IOT the

305
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:26,070
industrial Internet consortium and the

306
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,899
open interconnect consortium are working

307
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,240
towards standards that will deliver that

308
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,920
will support interoperability while

309
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,630
taking security into account at the same

310
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,480
time research is going into many

311
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,040
different approaches to the problem from

312
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,839
different angles including in areas of

313
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,790
cryptographic mechanisms embedded

314
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,890
security secure applications and novel

315
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,550
frameworks progress is even being made

316
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,990
with the internet engineering task force

317
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,600
deciding to use Datagram transport layer

318
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,880
security to secure communication between

319
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,459
constrain devices using co-op but

320
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:57,779
questions remain regarding this

321
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:59,880
applicability with concerns that it

322
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,339
doesn't actually scale that and that it

323
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:03,600
continues to use connection oriented

324
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,010
model that doesn't work particularly

325
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,740
well for the full scale ubiquitous IOT

326
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:15,630
as envisaged but what is it that we need

327
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,449
to do so in addition to user education

328
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:20,760
it's imperative that we also invest in

329
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,430
technological solutions we've got a

330
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,079
pretty robust list of requirements here

331
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,670
that will need that will need to meet if

332
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,949
we're to succeed in securing the IOT as

333
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,890
you can see it's a long list but we're

334
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,149
see if we're serious about making

335
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:35,880
security by design more than just a

336
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,800
marketing buzz word this is exactly what

337
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,560
we need to do considering the problems

338
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,959
posed by the nature of technology that

339
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,600
makes up the IOT pragmatic solutions are

340
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,040
more likely to recognize the limitations

341
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,769
of traditional notions of securing in

342
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:54,390
this context but what are we likely to

343
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,670
do while there's no doubt that many

344
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,870
different groups are thinking of

345
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,120
security several experts seem to be an

346
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,860
agreement about the nature of securing

347
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,250
the IOT again it's a matter of economics

348
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,839
many components of the IOT are highly

349
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,880
constrained in cheap which makes secure

350
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,089
security mechanisms hard

351
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:13,519
expensive marketers are often too

352
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,870
concerned with getting their product to

353
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,819
market to consider security and

354
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:18,649
technology is rapidly being repurposed

355
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:21,800
the real impetus for security is likely

356
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,449
to come from an economic driver as well

357
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:26,180
they'll build it people will come crime

358
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,309
will move in according to opportunity

359
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,110
crime theory then something will go

360
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,240
wrong security will be front and center

361
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,949
and the costs will be worthwhile because

362
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:35,839
of the significant risk posed by what's

363
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:42,050
happening in the wild so with that in

364
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,930
mind we can safely assume that attackers

365
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,670
are likely to apply all techniques to

366
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,649
this new technology so it's no surprise

367
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:50,449
that we're seeing vulnerable devices

368
00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:52,220
being exploited allowing attack us to

369
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,529
conduct man-in-the-middle attacks so

370
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:56,059
what does a man in the middle of tackle

371
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:58,639
clock in the IOT so we're recently

372
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,769
talking about earlier today and

373
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:03,620
yesterday as well a report that someone

374
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,480
had used their machine someone had had

375
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,040
their machine infected by a compromise

376
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,170
router the source of the malware

377
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,699
infection wasn't obvious to begin with

378
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:12,319
but eventually it was established the

379
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,970
router had been compromised and what's

380
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,410
the machine connected to it it too was

381
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,809
infected with the malware sleazy to

382
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:19,370
consider what's stopping a compromise

383
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,929
routers from infecting any device that

384
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:25,339
connect to it nothing really so we can

385
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:26,959
use that the IOT is particularly prone

386
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,870
to men in the middle as as so many

387
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,249
different divergent devices are

388
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:33,589
connected in at times unexpected ways

389
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:35,509
that create gaps that can otherwise be

390
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:38,389
exploited patching vulnerabilities will

391
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:40,819
be key to helping secure IOT devices but

392
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:43,370
one question that continues to arise is

393
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,620
who's responsible for keeping IOT

394
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,420
devices up to date is it the

395
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:53,929
manufacturer the seller or the user so

396
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:55,540
when we first started writing this paper

397
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,860
we thought we talked a lot about what we

398
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,069
thought we might see and we thought we

399
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:05,540
might see a great big new hack it felt

400
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,429
as though the recount down to an

401
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:10,279
explosion of IOT device attacks the fear

402
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:12,740
was building we thought we'd see a lot

403
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,189
more malware by this stage but we're not

404
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:17,600
we began asking ourselves is our

405
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,429
visibility into this area week well

406
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:21,709
quite possibly we're relying mostly on

407
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:23,750
what is being reported by other a big

408
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,520
companies in in the press and no one's

409
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,630
really saying anything much about

410
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,300
attacks in the wild when you search for

411
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,150
iit you get loads of stories mostly

412
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,860
predictions often quite scary

413
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,220
predictions we saw a peak in 2014 on

414
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,200
doomsday headlines but we seem to be

415
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,690
moving away from this now and instead

416
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,470
we're seeing repeated coverage of PSAs

417
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,850
so security is still very much a concern

418
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,430
with data breach is still very serious

419
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,770
and a very real risk but we seem to be

420
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,670
moving away from the fear-mongering

421
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:58,130
which is probably good so we thought it

422
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,300
was only a matter of time before the

423
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,100
pocs became reports of attacks in the

424
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,040
world and there was a glimpse of that to

425
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,570
come when the fridge was reported to be

426
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,570
hacked recently and while it turned out

427
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,980
to be a case of a threat spreading from

428
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,080
a machine to a router to a fridge rather

429
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,600
than a targeted IOT attack we considered

430
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,480
this a peek into the future using a

431
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,740
man-in-the-middle attack on iit

432
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,990
connected devices hackers demonstrated

433
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,370
that they can intercept communication

434
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,830
between devices and in a recent widely

435
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,390
reported case a refrigerators

436
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,280
communication was intercepted and the

437
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,550
user credentials exposed so no doubt you

438
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,660
heard of the researchers who recently

439
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,610
hacked into a car system and took

440
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,839
control of a number of the automobiles

441
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,850
peripheral functionality before sending

442
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,530
it offroad by putting the car into

443
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,080
neutral and disconnecting the engine so

444
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,520
exploiting vulnerabilities and Men in

445
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,020
the middle attacks and not new by any

446
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,790
means we've seen these four years in the

447
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,220
AV industry but for the first time these

448
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,780
attack methods are not only giving

449
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,310
hackers access to the data on our

450
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,900
machines but they're letting attackers

451
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,550
into every area of our house and

452
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,490
business so think about how often you

453
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,710
update or replace your devices your

454
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,050
phone probably updating pretty regularly

455
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,510
replacing maybe every year or two you

456
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,400
computer hopefully you're updating it

457
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,170
pretty regularly might be replacing it

458
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,530
every year or two as well your

459
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,569
appliances never updated and

460
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:17,839
infrequently replaced the longer you

461
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,459
hold onto these devices the more

462
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:21,410
vulnerable your house becomes just

463
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,119
having an attacker hack your fridge or

464
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,829
thermostat might not necessarily seem

465
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,660
like a big security risk but when those

466
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,040
devices are all linked to a network

467
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,140
controlled from a computer the risk

468
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,780
doesn't seem that small anymore again we

469
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,130
ask who's going to assume responsibility

470
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,929
for patching these devices

471
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:42,049
and how we even going to patch them so

472
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:43,669
it looks like none of our devices are

473
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:46,970
safe and as we're often reminded the

474
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,619
chain is only as strong as its weakest

475
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:51,139
link so some figures that were recently

476
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:52,820
charted by the equity group are that

477
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,590
today roughly seven percent of consumers

478
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,700
own a wearable Internet device

479
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,570
approximately four percent have an

480
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,879
in-home IOT device and they're

481
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:04,039
predicting that by 2016 twenty-eight

482
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:06,649
percent of people will own wearable

483
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:09,230
devices and within about five years two

484
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,360
thirds of consumers plan to buy an

485
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,899
in-home IOT device gartner predicts that

486
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:18,320
the IOT will create us 1.9 trillion

487
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,070
dollars of economic value add by 2020 so

488
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,830
I ask you like what out of our current

489
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,509
IOT connected devices could be

490
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:28,059
considered the most valuable to a hacker

491
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:31,879
how is that value determined while it's

492
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:33,169
too early to see any patterns emerging

493
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:36,200
from while it's too early to see any

494
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,789
patterns emerging we can see that this

495
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:39,950
is that we have enormous global uptake

496
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,499
in IOT devices there are some pretty

497
00:18:42,499 --> 00:18:43,879
interesting search engines that are

498
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:45,919
mapping devices on a heat map there's no

499
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,509
question that the process of large-scale

500
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:49,940
adoption of IOT should i OT devices is

501
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,639
in progress and while we believe that

502
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:54,019
these devices will continue to become

503
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:55,730
more available more widely adopted

504
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:00,019
cheaper and easier to use from the most

505
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:02,299
menial task think the device reminding

506
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:03,740
the reminding you that you're out of

507
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,970
milk and you need to get some on the way

508
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,330
home to a life-saving task consider

509
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,559
being alerted that your insulin is

510
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,119
dangerously high or low before you even

511
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:17,570
experienced a symptom so we've talked a

512
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,490
lot about the industry consensus and we

513
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,259
all agree what needs to be done to

514
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:24,049
secure the IOT and its devices we know

515
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:25,340
that some every companies are investing

516
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,139
in embedded security technology to help

517
00:19:27,139 --> 00:19:29,539
protect these devices and as always

518
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:31,549
considerations around cost performance

519
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:34,039
and performance are important especially

520
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,499
when the device scale is so broad from

521
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:38,779
tiny inexpensive fitbit's too costly

522
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:42,049
medical machinery there's an enormous

523
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:43,909
amount of scope for new as well as

524
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:45,950
existing players to step up and work

525
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,940
together to secure

526
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,760
IOT technology threat modeling will be

527
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,350
key to ensuring the protective

528
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,730
mechanisms are specific and targeted

529
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,500
enough to meet the light weight

530
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,010
requirements of protection going forward

531
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,240
so while our traditional heavy

532
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,130
computational or centralized approaches

533
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,900
might not work as well here our

534
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,730
experience with the analysis of threats

535
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,900
from big dirt from the big data

536
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,490
perspective puts this industry in a

537
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,830
unique position to put to be a potential

538
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,260
leader and a trusted advisor to many of

539
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:17,450
the other businesses that will come so

540
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,580
as we've seen the security issues for

541
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,440
the IOT are not insignificant we've

542
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,060
talked a lot about that in the last day

543
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,910
and a half many of the problems really

544
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,410
do continue to fall into the too hard

545
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,300
basket and will likely remain there for

546
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,010
some time but there's an opportunity

547
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,960
here for the people in this audience in

548
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,780
particular the potential for dystopian

549
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,030
outcomes is not overstated but of course

550
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,890
you need to ask yourself where is the

551
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,800
value what's the risk just because

552
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,180
something's vulnerable doesn't mean that

553
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,910
it will be targeted security has to take

554
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,250
a holistic approach more than product

555
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,320
lifecycle management engineering has to

556
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,540
be captured intelligently a new

557
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,370
innovative design goals have to be met

558
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,500
to manage the low or no interfaces in

559
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,770
real time the secret to successfully

560
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,570
protecting the IOT might be realizing

561
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,220
that it can't actually be protected and

562
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,960
then working out how we can continue to

563
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,310
operate in an environment that is

564
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,680
inherently insecure and highly likely to

565
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,100
remain so perhaps indefinitely as the

566
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,110
security experts here we ask you to

567
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,760
respond to this call to action be

568
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,160
proactive in this discussion engage with

569
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,170
the IOT industry and share your wisdom

570
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:26,960
in the art of putting security first see

571
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,440
it does anyone have any questions we

572
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,250
have some time for questions

573
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:42,100
so in the meantime so what is the what's

574
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,040
the tipping point so how how much market

575
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,930
penetration of these devices have to do

576
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,510
before there's actually some sort of

577
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,910
incentive for the bad guys to actually

578
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,360
start attacking these things on mass

579
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,830
spices I suppose that's the great

580
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,530
unknown we really don't know because we

581
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,690
haven't been able to see enough evidence

582
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,490
in the wild yet to to be able to make a

583
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:08,230
good assumption I suppose that's you

584
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,520
know that's what we try and touch on

585
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,320
quite a bit in the paper actually it's

586
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,270
like we can make we can speculate an

587
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,530
awful lot about what we think might

588
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,390
happen but until we actually see it we

589
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:22,720
don't know for sure so remember hearing

590
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,170
a talk one time word someone from

591
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,820
marketing was suggesting that there is a

592
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,040
magic number on twenty one percent so if

593
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,480
you see only twenty percent of people

594
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,970
with with an apple headset it doesn't

595
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,950
register in twenty one percent and all

596
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,050
of a sudden so maybe there's some

597
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:42,070
magical tipping point there any

598
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,100
questions from the audience okay it's me

599
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,870
again thanks everyone um so do you think

600
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,800
this future is inevitable though yeah

601
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,430
definitely without a doubt I think it's

602
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,430
it's inevitable the there's a lot of

603
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,900
evidence of wide and global uptake it's

604
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,750
devices a a part of everyday life and

605
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,280
they're infiltrating into into all

606
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,310
different areas and services so we

607
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,630
absolutely believe that it's inevitable

608
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:17,260
there's no escaping but is there a

609
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,620
difference then between say my computer

610
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,510
being locked up with all my data by

611
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,970
ransomware and my fridge being locked up

612
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,340
I ransomware because I can always go for

613
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,280
supper yep so are we comparing apples

614
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,200
and oranges here well I suppose it

615
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,700
really depends how much value you put on

616
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,870
on the device that's being

617
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,720
outdoor targeted so for instance I know

618
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,350
if I hate using parents as an example

619
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,360
for these things but if my mom's

620
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,180
computer was was locked I don't think it

621
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,830
would be a terribly big deal because she

622
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,720
doesn't have anything of particular

623
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,780
value or importance on it in her world

624
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,450
at this current point in time if your

625
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,850
fridge you know gets hacked I suppose it

626
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,320
depends on you know what you actually

627
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,640
had in and how desperate you after

628
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,240
something to eat if you're relying on

629
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,990
something to eat because of a medical

630
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,130
condition that you need to have

631
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,300
something there like it has a different

632
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,940
value it's all weighted differently so i

633
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,720
think it's relative in a lot of ways so

634
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,580
if my yogurt is about it aloft and i

635
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,679
might be remember awesome good coin or

636
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:19,850
like if you think if you're a business

637
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,580
owner and you're using a device to

638
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,110
monitor the temperatures of all of the

639
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,700
refrigerator's within your business or

640
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,150
within their yeah within your business

641
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,650
and you might have a chain of businesses

642
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:35,120
and the monitoring devices is hacked and

643
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,190
all of the temperatures in every single

644
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,730
fridge is tampered with and you lose

645
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,390
potentially hundreds of thousands of

646
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,740
dollars worth of produce and that has a

647
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,830
significant value to you yeah if there's

648
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:50,420
a question in the back so when you are

649
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,620
talking about the refrigerator there's

650
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,800
actually a much more insidious attack

651
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,010
the refrigerator's turned off the milk

652
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,440
starts going bad or something dangerous

653
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,500
but when you return its back on and you

654
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,100
don't know that the the food was

655
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,790
compromised

656
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,090
it's just an opposite Ridge yeah

657
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,500
definitely I mean not only that I mean

658
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:23,090
it how how likely are you to immediately

659
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,130
assume that it was that your fridge was

660
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,899
compromised and it wasn't just a power

661
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:30,440
outage or a short something that short

662
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,559
shorted in them in the system similarly

663
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:35,480
if someone hacks your your lighting

664
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,799
system or your light bulbs you might

665
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,320
just assume that it's it's died a

666
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,820
natural death and it just needs

667
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,860
replacing you won't necessarily firstly

668
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,179
assume or initially assume that it's

669
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:45,980
being compromised in any way so I

670
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,630
suppose we're all in a learning curve

671
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,669
when it comes to managing connected

672
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:53,299
devices in a lot of ways that's new for

673
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:57,320
everyone sorry question right there the

674
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,000
take-home messages to watch the dairy

675
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,520
products that's right yeah yeah well you

676
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,429
do that anyway right I would heart I

677
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:05,840
mean I also think there's a liability

678
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,010
issue the chemical manufacturer if if

679
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:12,440
something like this happens to fridge so

680
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,059
who's responsible so you just bought a

681
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:16,220
fish the fish is new somebody goes on

682
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,860
tax again stops working so if you pass

683
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,240
this liability to manufacture that I

684
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,130
would have to take care of securing the

685
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,529
device make sure that it can be updated

686
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:27,049
remotely I mean we have the same problem

687
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:29,179
with the droid devices Android devices

688
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:34,309
and somehow somewhere it's sort of

689
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:36,440
manageable to the extent where it can be

690
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,090
a sort of so to speak and some way all

691
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,600
secure so perhaps here I should consider

692
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,840
maybe I'm just a suggestion that the

693
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,850
whole industry should come together on

694
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,860
this and with the insurance because if

695
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,440
something happens to you when you will

696
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,330
use the fridge and you can pass this

697
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,730
liability to the manufacturer they're

698
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,320
going to be hit hard with the with the

699
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,559
dollar signs so perhaps is just a

700
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:06,440
comment absolutely not I've I agree

701
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:13,549
thanks a leg any other questions thank

702
