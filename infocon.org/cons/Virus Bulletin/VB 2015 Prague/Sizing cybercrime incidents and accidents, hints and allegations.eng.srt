1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:08,730
ready okay we're ready um good day

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,980
everybody it's time for the next talk so

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,469
if you could please take a seat I'm

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:15,929
really pleased to introduce steven cobb

5
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,380
from ESAT his talk is on sizing cyber

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,230
crime incidents and accidents hints and

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,840
allegations and before he starts I

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,220
wanted to give a quick little vb tidbit

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,930
about his Steve he first spoke at virus

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,469
bulletin in 1994 and that was in Jersey

11
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,370
and his talk then was on Windows NT have

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,760
come a long way since 94 Steve all right

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,860
go ahead well thank you very much yes

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,550
yes it was on Windows NT security which

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,110
was possibly an oxymoron but um I

16
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,680
appreciate you staying here for this for

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,609
the run-up to lunchtime this is I think

18
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,760
a topic that our industry sometimes

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,390
loses focus of what is the size of the

20
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,670
problem we're trying to solve not all

21
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,400
information security is a problem of

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,890
cyber crime but cyber crime is a problem

23
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,619
for information security and if somebody

24
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,450
says well how big is the problem it's

25
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,610
often difficult to come up with an

26
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,229
answer I'll start out with a quote that

27
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:30,990
kind of addresses this stop wasting

28
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,540
money on measuring cybercrime spend it

29
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,640
on the police instead anybody know who

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,170
said that if I repeated it with a

31
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,780
Scottish accent without help that was

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,159
Ross Anderson commenting actually on

33
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,500
Iran a study that I mentioned in in the

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,140
paper and by the way what I'm going to

35
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,790
talk about today is kind of highlights

36
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,750
from the paper that are in the

37
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,619
proceedings stop wasting money I'm

38
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,740
measuring cyber crime I think there's a

39
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,030
good case for saying we have wasted

40
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,280
money on some pretty rubbish reports

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,920
about cybercrime spend it on the police

42
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,840
instead definitely I'm definitely all

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,670
for putting more money into law

44
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,900
enforcement finding bad guy

45
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,030
catching bad guys locking up the bad

46
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,489
guys of which we are doing some but not

47
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:21,189
enough the problem is if you ask for

48
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:23,349
more money for law enforcement people

49
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:24,280
are going to say well what's your

50
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,769
justification and if you spend more

51
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:28,030
money on law enforcement they're going

52
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,950
to say how well did it work and that

53
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,049
kind of involves saying how big the

54
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:34,150
cybercrime problem is or how much you've

55
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,400
reduced cybercrime so there is this

56
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,730
issue of measurement we need to address

57
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,879
so basically how much is there what does

58
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,139
it cost us and if you're in a rush

59
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,849
you're hungry you need to go give you

60
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:50,620
the answer very quickly the quick

61
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,620
version is too much yeah we know that

62
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,030
there's too much cybercrime there's

63
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,340
nobody going well maybe a little bit

64
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,560
more you know bring it on I don't think

65
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,859
so if there's anybody in the audience

66
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:04,870
who's not in the information security

67
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,989
business I'd like to say that we don't

68
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:11,859
see cybercrime as a career benefit as a

69
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,849
job guarantee I think a lot of us would

70
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:17,590
rather do something else then deal with

71
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,889
cyber crime we do not welcome the next

72
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:23,709
new wave of malware we kind of low the

73
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:26,230
next new wave of malware we'd really

74
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,220
like to do something more productive

75
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,010
than deal with criminals who are abusing

76
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,260
the technology I think a lot of us got

77
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,090
into this because we like the technology

78
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,909
we'd like to be able to use it without

79
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:38,169
stupid things showing up pretending to

80
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:39,790
be from somebody else like the message I

81
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,409
just got from my bank which really

82
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:44,290
wasn't from my bank and I nearly fell

83
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,540
for it so what's the total cost of

84
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,609
cybercrime this gentleman is you may

85
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:51,970
recognize general Keith Alexander who

86
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,090
was until recently the head of the NSA

87
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,010
this man had tens of billions of dollars

88
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,310
of annual budget as his disposal so you

89
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,590
think wow man he be able to do some

90
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,180
research on this he'd know how big this

91
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,280
problem was his answer 1 trillion

92
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,419
cyberattacks cost us one trillion

93
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:11,849
dollars and where did he get that from

94
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:15,099
did he get it from research no it was in

95
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:18,728
a press release Mac if he did a study in

96
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:21,849
2009 which did not contain the number 1

97
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:23,710
trillion dollars but when they were

98
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,880
putting out the press release somebody

99
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,020
thought they could do a little bit of

100
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,560
math spice it up a little bit

101
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,590
out comes the one trillion dollar number

102
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,700
President Obama's repeated the one

103
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,590
trillion dollar number the one trillion

104
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,360
dollar number just really doesn't exist

105
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,510
and mentioning Ross by the way a couple

106
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,270
of years ago Tyler presented the study

107
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,730
that Ross led on the cost of cybercrime

108
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,340
still probably he presented it here at

109
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,410
virus bulletin or virus bulletin when it

110
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,110
was in Dallas I think still I think the

111
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,440
best study it has hundreds of billions

112
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,190
in there but not a trillion so y mejor

113
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:04,460
cybercrime these six points were kind of

114
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,070
agreed on in a symposium in Oxford about

115
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,050
five years ago that was called to

116
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,060
address the problem cybercrime but they

117
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,620
actually apply across all kinds of crime

118
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,320
all kinds of crime needs to be measured

119
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:22,430
arm for these very good reasons I've got

120
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,500
one in particular which applies very

121
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,660
much to people who are trying to protect

122
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,070
information systems and that is the risk

123
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,919
manager risk management process requires

124
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,190
inputs and if you look at say nest 800

125
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,970
the standard used in a lot of referenced

126
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,950
in a lot of regulations and in the

127
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,440
states anyway there are a couple of

128
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,140
pieces of information you need to assess

129
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,770
a particular threat to your system the

130
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,930
likelihood of occurrence and the

131
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,289
magnitude of impact how much is there

132
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:00,050
how often does it happen and what's the

133
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,150
cost what's it going to do so this chart

134
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,850
is in the paper just kind of a summary

135
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,010
of who needs this information it's not

136
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,020
like if we studied the cyber crime

137
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,930
problem and tried to measure it nobody

138
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,010
would be interested there are a lot of

139
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,100
people interested but when I was writing

140
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,330
this I found that criminal justice the

141
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,850
judiciary they're interested now because

142
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,110
if you're going to punish somebody for a

143
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,850
crime knowing how prevalent the crime is

144
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,590
is kind of important and there are a lot

145
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,720
of people who would like the answers to

146
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,910
the questions as to how much crime there

147
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,240
is and if you study crime which I'm

148
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,750
actually doing right now at the universe

149
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,820
the in England in the criminology

150
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,400
Department you find the can be good news

151
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,640
so this is meatspace crime real crime

152
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,910
physical crime larceny theft burglary

153
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,090
car theft in the United States crimes

154
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,470
per hundred thousand people so it's

155
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,720
adjusted for population and you can see

156
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,760
that in the 60s and 70s and 80s oh it

157
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,290
was getting bad we were coming crime

158
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,540
wave upon crime wave but then he started

159
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,740
to get better and it's actually come

160
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,100
down a lot and there is less property

161
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,260
crime in America so you know maybe if we

162
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,730
studied cyber crime and we were studying

163
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,270
it we could see all it went down we can

164
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,010
only hope so when do we start measuring

165
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:22,410
crime interestingly not that long ago in

166
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,080
the 1700s people started to count things

167
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,490
how many people are there how many

168
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,680
people were born and how many went to

169
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,470
school and so on this gentleman in

170
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,180
France decided to go and get the

171
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,580
statistics for all of the districts in

172
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,050
France and he kind of correlated them

173
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,640
and it was the first time somebody had

174
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,000
done this and they found shocker it

175
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,150
wasn't the ignorant peasants or the

176
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,100
areas where there was less education

177
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,990
where there was more crime property

178
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,700
crime he was in the areas of France

179
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,400
where there was more education not

180
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,200
necessarily cause an effect very

181
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,290
interesting though and he actually had

182
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,900
printed the very first infographic I

183
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,880
think and this thing when it's printed

184
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,950
is huge it's in color and it's an

185
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:12,690
annotated set of maps showing the amount

186
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,669
of education the amount of crime and so

187
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:16,110
on and so forth in the different parts

188
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,260
of France in the 1800s but there are

189
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,550
many challenges when you start to count

190
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,890
crying because what is a crime yeah is

191
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,070
it something that gets reported Oh

192
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,260
somebody stole my car really or did you

193
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,500
just lose him um crimes are investigated

194
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,299
okay it's a real crime because we went

195
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,429
and looked we couldn't find the car it's

196
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,950
definitely been stolen or we actually

197
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,240
caught the person who stole the car we

198
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,849
proved to crime and that's going to be a

199
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:44,580
statistic and obviously statistics these

200
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,680
days are kept on all of those in regular

201
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,820
physical space crimes but also it was

202
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,920
found decades ago

203
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,990
that not all crime was reported so it

204
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,700
might make sense to ask people and

205
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,459
certainly in the US and the UK tens of

206
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,829
thousands of households are surveyed

207
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:04,019
every year to see what their experience

208
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:10,100
of crime has been however it's true that

209
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,740
some crime as my friend Mishka vay but

210
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,110
it just doesn't get found out there are

211
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,899
crimes of which nobody except the

212
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,600
committer of the crime knows about so we

213
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,760
call that in criminology the dark figure

214
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,920
of crime it'll always be there you know

215
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,660
so we're never going to actually measure

216
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,570
all of the crime but we can agree on

217
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,240
what a particular thing is is it a crime

218
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,920
as I get reported does it have a name

219
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,459
and can we count the numbers of it

220
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:40,110
computer crime measurement began I think

221
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,649
in the 70s SR I started to collect just

222
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:47,370
case studies of abuse and Don Parker put

223
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,660
out I think the first computer crime

224
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,180
book in 1976 that collected these by

225
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,209
1980 there were enough maybe a dozen

226
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:55,800
different studies of crime for a

227
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,230
gentleman John Taber who I don't know

228
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,329
what where he is or what happened to him

229
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:04,320
but he wrote this long analysis of the

230
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,790
different crime studies were out there

231
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,670
and he was not happy he was really upset

232
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,490
that this term abuse had been used and

233
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,279
the term abuse was used because some

234
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,930
things weren't actually crimes right

235
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,600
before the various crime acts were

236
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,370
passed they were just bad things that

237
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,230
people did with computers and but he

238
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,699
didn't like the fact that these were

239
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:25,800
confused he felt that there were

240
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,720
companies had an agenda to try and make

241
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,199
more of computer crime than was really

242
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:35,730
the case he also pointed out that if

243
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,970
there is a crime story put out there it

244
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,279
will persist potentially despite the

245
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,560
data and I give you the one trillion

246
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,600
dollar cost of cyber attacks right and

247
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,500
another one was the 8020 rule Samba

248
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,360
somebody I think from the FBI in the

249
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,149
1980s said oh eighty percent of Computer

250
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:57,360
Fraud is internal and that then every

251
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,180
year people get is it still 80 is it is

252
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,040
it fifty-fifty as more external attacks

253
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,470
happen people oh no it's 5050 now now

254
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,170
it's a d20 the other

255
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,200
which is actually not the numbers you

256
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,480
really want because it only takes one

257
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,780
Snowden and internal attacks are much

258
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,280
bigger than external attacks so some of

259
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,990
you may remember some of these from the

260
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,180
past if you're very old you might

261
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,010
remember that the UK audit Commission

262
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,800
started looking at computer fraud in

263
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,200
local authorities and they did that

264
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,430
every three years for a number of years

265
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,140
when I wrote my first computer security

266
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,030
book they had a put of a number of

267
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:40,260
studies out there then CSI computer

268
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,500
security Institute sadly no more they

269
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,620
started in 96 and they developed kind of

270
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,720
a model you do a study of crime they did

271
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,700
one with some people from the FBI you

272
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,860
put it out there you how old a hearing

273
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,720
they were actually in hearings on

274
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,840
Capitol Hill and put out a press release

275
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,480
and you get a lot of attention and they

276
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,890
started doing those they did those for

277
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,530
15 years and then somebody bought CSI

278
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,220
and it just died a lot of people in the

279
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,920
industry had problems with them because

280
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,270
these reports because although they

281
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,980
claimed they had a disclaimer in there

282
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,290
they were really not that statistically

283
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,880
valid in terms of the numbers that they

284
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,500
put out the problem was they were the

285
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,660
only numbers in many years that came out

286
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,090
in terms of people saying oh yes we got

287
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,510
attacked and this is how we got attacked

288
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:32,430
cert together with CSO online or CSO now

289
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,770
CSO online together with various

290
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,600
accounting firms in the US Secret

291
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,480
Service started doing studies in 2004

292
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,030
they missed a few years and they now put

293
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:45,050
them out with PricewaterhouseCoopers

294
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,150
there was one in 2005 there was quite

295
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,620
interesting this was the first and only

296
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,290
study done of certainly computer crime

297
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,330
as it affects businesses in America I

298
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,820
was very interesting because it had the

299
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,140
power of the Department of Justice

300
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,000
Bureau of Labor Statistics and those

301
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,120
people behind it it got a much better

302
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,990
response rate from from the survey than

303
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,530
any of the others over 8,000 firms

304
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,180
participated

305
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,730
be typically these other reports are

306
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,130
only about five six hundred responses a

307
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,430
15-percent response rate however because

308
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,700
it was done by proper statisticians they

309
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,140
had a disclaimer in there that even

310
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,850
though it was that big you really

311
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,970
couldn't generalize from the results and

312
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,760
so they had a warning in there which I

313
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,230
don't know that people ever read those

314
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,180
warnings but sadly it though was not

315
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,520
that specific about what a security

316
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,980
threat was what an instant was what his

317
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,339
computer crime was 22 million security

318
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:56,880
incidents but 20 million were just other

319
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,630
which I don't think was very helpful and

320
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,700
it was never been repeated and if you

321
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,500
asked the Department of Justice today

322
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,180
are you going to know another one of

323
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,870
those they say no we're not and have you

324
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,220
seen the price waterhouse coopers report

325
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,420
of which I will speak more in a moment

326
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:24,839
so 2003 we see the first academic alarm

327
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,910
over these surveys Ryan and Jefferson

328
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:34,020
looked at surveys fan that there was

329
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,970
because they were trying to do these

330
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,580
anonymously they were potentially

331
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,709
counting as multiple companies multiple

332
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:45,540
reports from people at one company and

333
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,959
so there really was no solid basis for

334
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,190
the numbers and the conclusions that

335
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,630
they were drawing and when they asked

336
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,420
people about what was your loss what's

337
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,450
your average loss and a whole bunch of

338
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,250
people had responded from one company

339
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,930
and they all talked about the same loss

340
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,790
and that company happened to have a

341
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,440
particularly bad loss which might be why

342
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,640
they're responding to a computer

343
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,060
security survey skewed the numbers off

344
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:16,950
off the chart and this one of the

345
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,360
problems with academic report sometimes

346
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,410
is that people don't read them and take

347
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,839
them to heart and so almost ten years

348
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,570
later we had our florencio and Hurley

349
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,720
did their report Sex Lies and cybercrime

350
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,449
surveys totally tore apart

351
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:32,429
the way that this stuff is done and I'll

352
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:35,489
in the interest of time that's in the

353
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:38,279
paper basically the methodology just was

354
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:42,660
really bad and and the way sex came came

355
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,419
into it is if and this is many studies

356
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:47,489
have shown this if you ask men and women

357
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,519
how many lifetimes sex partners they had

358
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,619
the numbers don't add up not

359
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,329
surprisingly their editor because a few

360
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:57,989
guys lie or exaggerate shall we say and

361
00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:00,679
so when you're putting together numbers

362
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:04,739
it's really easy to throw off numbers if

363
00:16:04,739 --> 00:16:06,959
a few people just persistently get the

364
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,779
number wrong on one extreme or the other

365
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:12,749
and so they did a lot of statistical

366
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:14,399
analysis that showed it's really not

367
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,999
possible to rely on the surveys as they

368
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:19,649
were being done with these small numbers

369
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:22,649
that weren't verify data input and so on

370
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,709
and even if you do a large study it's

371
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:29,040
going to be hard to get good answers so

372
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,790
is there any upside to surveys I think

373
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,980
there is and I think that if you ask

374
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,189
people what they think about crime that

375
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:42,179
is not necessarily going to help the

376
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:44,669
risk manager who's deciding between this

377
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:46,769
type of threat to defend against in that

378
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:48,480
type of threat to defend against and

379
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,129
making relative judgments of that nature

380
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:53,759
but if you're trying to get say more

381
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,489
money for policing crime and you could

382
00:16:56,489 --> 00:16:58,819
show that crime is affecting people

383
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:01,949
through a survey where people's opinions

384
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:04,109
are not subject to those same problems

385
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:06,569
of yes it was five dollars I lost or

386
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:08,880
$100 olas it's their opinion as to what

387
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,250
they're doing it can be helpful and

388
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,209
there is something called the EU

389
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:14,819
barometer series of statistical studies

390
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:19,049
done by the EU by the government where

391
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:20,880
they serve a thousand people in each of

392
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,099
27 countries and they do one every

393
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,019
couple of years on cybercrime and that

394
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:29,600
shows in the last two studies that

395
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,490
people are less some people are less

396
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,730
likely to use the internet for

397
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,380
commercial transactions because of

398
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,840
cybercrime and there was some some good

399
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,639
secondary analysis has been done of that

400
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:43,559
that shows that even when you adjust for

401
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,130
various

402
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,650
things yes cybercrime is making people

403
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:52,110
nervous and so if you could get the

404
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,270
money to a cyber crime reduction program

405
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,310
and then you did a survey and it showed

406
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,110
that people oh I feel better about the

407
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,400
internet now I'm going to use it more

408
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,700
that would be useful information but if

409
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,740
you did the survey found that the way

410
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,560
things are going and all of the

411
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,640
ransomware the malware and the bad

412
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,080
things are happening less and less

413
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,000
people are using the internet well that

414
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,680
might help you get more money or more

415
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,710
interest in solving the problem reports

416
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,000
said bad things that actually happened

417
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,590
are also useful so the verizon data

418
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,050
breach investigation report comes out

419
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:26,040
every year very interesting but you have

420
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,020
to read the small print which says this

421
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,730
is based on the people who reported

422
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:33,750
things to us right so all yeah one of

423
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,490
the numbers in this year's was that

424
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,220
malware on mobile devices is not a

425
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,550
problem is this not a problem for the

426
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,310
people who responded and reported to the

427
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,230
verizon data breach investigation report

428
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,120
I've contend it's a bit more of a

429
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,060
problem than no problem at all but again

430
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,920
you have to look at what is being

431
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,060
measured by whom and you have to

432
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,710
disclaim that appropriately and just as

433
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,690
an indication of how far off we are you

434
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,220
know Larry Ponemon the Ponemon Institute

435
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,160
has been doing this calculation of the

436
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,270
cost per record in a security breach I

437
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,710
think their latest number globally was a

438
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,810
hundred forty five dollars the verizon

439
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:20,460
dbr said it was 58 cents I said I'm very

440
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,020
suspicious when I did the math and it

441
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,890
was exactly 250 less the larry's number

442
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,190
i'm like that sounds you it wasn't 247 X

443
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,690
it was exactly 250 x and if we've got

444
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,210
that much of a gap can we really say we

445
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,190
know how big of a problem cybercrime is

446
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,410
we need to be able to give better

447
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,320
answers I anybody from

448
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,750
pricewaterhousecoopers here no okay it's

449
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,010
funny when I asked that a lady at the

450
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,440
back held up a sign saying 10 I liked is

451
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,490
10 people from pricewaterhousecoopers

452
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,059
here so

453
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:00,090
if I've got that much time um let me see

454
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,990
I might have the PricewaterhouseCoopers

455
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:08,999
report with me because this is kind of

456
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,230
the problem we've got at the moment

457
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,870
certainly in America is the government's

458
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,549
basically abdicated tracking cybercrime

459
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:20,549
not quite sure why maybe just lazy but

460
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:24,269
this is that this is what you get right

461
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:27,120
ah there's very few statistics in here

462
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,320
there's a lot of waffle about how to run

463
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,029
your company and manage things and

464
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:35,249
problems around the world and yes

465
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:36,960
there's forty-eight percent more cyber

466
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,820
crime now than there was a year ago and

467
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,929
you're like really how can you tell um I

468
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:45,659
was only about six hundred and fifty

469
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:51,480
nine responses make this thing up and if

470
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,950
you get a hold of PricewaterhouseCoopers

471
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,230
you say I'm researching cyber security I

472
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,440
am officially an enrolled student at a

473
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,220
university can I get the numbers so I

474
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,749
can do some more research no they are

475
00:21:05,749 --> 00:21:09,269
proprietary and it really annoys me

476
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,820
because they're using the United States

477
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,340
Secret Service answer to help them get

478
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,499
these numbers and yet the numbers are

479
00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:21,450
proprietary and we've got to do better

480
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,350
than that we're good to have some better

481
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,600
numbers coming from a source which

482
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,529
doesn't shall we say cell security

483
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:36,299
services so maybe what we need is a code

484
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:39,809
of conduct right maybe as certainly as

485
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:42,779
information security professionals we

486
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:46,139
would pledge to never site cyber crime

487
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,879
statistics without the appropriate

488
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:51,389
caveats say that this is what we found

489
00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:54,509
this is how we found it this may not be

490
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:57,330
a representative sample and to be honest

491
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,360
a lot of studies put that in there

492
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,960
PricewaterhouseCoopers has dropped it

493
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,610
completely but the CSI always used to

494
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,669
put there in there and certainly verizon

495
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:07,529
puts it in there by the way folks this

496
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:08,710
is just amongst

497
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:13,840
people that we got reports from I will

498
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,390
always state exactly what is being

499
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:21,250
measured and by whom give you a moment

500
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:30,190
to read that maybe people aren't reading

501
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:34,149
it I when I first did these slides I was

502
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:36,100
going to put a picture in here and I

503
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,350
forgot so last night I put ads cool

504
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,240
stock photo here to spice things up for

505
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,880
the bv 2015 audience may be mentioned

506
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,809
lunch time which is almost here ok and

507
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:49,480
I'm still writing this so there's a

508
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,120
bullet point to be added on and maybe if

509
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,559
we want to discuss this later in the day

510
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,990
I'm going to be here all week I'd be

511
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,669
interested in this as something which

512
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:00,880
maybe we can do in the industry is be

513
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,480
more proactive about how we convey

514
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,149
numbers to people and all of us probably

515
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:08,679
have a marketing department somewhere

516
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,470
that we we need to talk to whenever they

517
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,279
start using numbers to use them sensibly

518
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:20,350
and appropriately but I don't think that

519
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,450
the effort to measure cybercrime is a

520
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:28,510
waste of time because here's crime that

521
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,870
i showed before right starts to come

522
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:36,549
down round about well let's see ninety

523
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:40,960
to ninety six in that range there so

524
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,720
what if it didn't go down but it just

525
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,600
moved online right what if we haven't

526
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,510
had a crime drop really it's just moved

527
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:53,409
into cyberspace so even if the news is

528
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:55,149
bad we need to know because that much

529
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:57,610
might have moved into cyberspace or it

530
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,710
might be that much we don't at this

531
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,980
point in time now so with that I will I

532
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,860
will end and our thank you for your

533
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,970
attention we live secure comm is where

534
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,309
myself and other people from ESET

535
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:14,950
published their research i'm steven cobb

536
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,380
at ESET com zhukov on twitter and

537
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,659
SlideShare and that's the monochromator

538
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,909
for those who can remember what

539
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:25,190
micrometers were that was actually made

540
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,450
in the Midlands in England where I grew

541
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,029
up and I I've got a couple of minutes of

542
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:32,119
questions one or two questions are there

543
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:35,539
any questions for Stephen lunch is

544
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:38,049
probably looming large in people's minds

545
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:41,269
so Stephen am I right to assume that

546
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:43,999
that last slide you showed where

547
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:47,629
property crime is going down you don't

548
00:24:47,629 --> 00:24:49,789
really have stats showing cybercrime

549
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:54,129
going up so yes yeah so there are stats

550
00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:56,899
I see three which I don't think I

551
00:24:56,899 --> 00:24:58,549
mentioned but it was on the slide there

552
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:00,379
the internet crime and complaint center

553
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:03,470
which is an FBI project has been taking

554
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,479
numbers and publishing numbers since

555
00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:08,269
2000 on fraud related to the internet

556
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:11,419
and those numbers go like that the

557
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:13,909
problem is they haven't been consistent

558
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:15,049
about how they collected them

559
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:17,539
encountered them they take some reports

560
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:19,749
from outside of America so it's not a

561
00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:21,830
certainly from an academic point of view

562
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,349
a terribly clean data set yeah that

563
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:27,619
pretty much every line that tries to

564
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:29,509
measure cybercrime yes it does go at

565
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:30,769
pricewaterhousecoopers it went out

566
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:32,929
forty-eight percent last year it's going

567
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:34,940
like that what is difficult though

568
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,869
without really solid objective numbers

569
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:41,830
is to then take that argument and beat

570
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,419
over the head those persons who could

571
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:47,679
put out more money to solve the problem

572
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,759
super thank you can you join me in

573
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:52,090
thanking Steve for a great presentation

574
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,238
thank you
