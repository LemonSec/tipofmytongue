00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:09,760
hello everyone

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,240
my name is jamie collier and it's great

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,519
to be speaking here

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,000
at the varus bullitt conference one of

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,440
the things that actually

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,359
got me really interested in pursuing a

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,279
career in cyber threat intelligence

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,119
was reading some of the various bulletin

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,599
conference papers from a few years ago

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,279
so it almost feels like i've come full

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,640
circle here but delighted to be speaking

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,920
i'm a cyber threat intelligence

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,079
consultant at far right mandiant

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,079
the majority of my time is spent

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,000
briefing organizations on the threat

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,120
landscape

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,280
as well as helping them to develop their

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,800
intelligence capability

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,719
effectively that means improving their

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,239
ability to implement

22
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,600
and use intelligence in productive ways

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,719
however i do want to give a shout out to

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,000
digital shadows

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,399
my former employer i was working at

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,440
digital shadows

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,280
when i initially submitted for this

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,440
conference and a lot of my colleagues at

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,079
the time

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,840
provided really valuable input in

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,600
shaping some of the ideas

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,560
in this presentation now today i'm going

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,040
to be

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,560
imagining the rise and fall of the cti

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,040
industry

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,360
over the next decade and this is going

37
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,040
to involve back casting

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,759
now this is an analytical technique that

39
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,880
involves

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,720
imagining or establishing an imagined

41
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,920
future scenario

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,159
and then moving backwards in time to

43
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,680
understand what could have caused that

44
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,799
outcome

45
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,320
now it can be used for a variety of

46
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,479
purposes we can have a lot of creative

47
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,240
freedom about the future scenario which

48
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,079
can be either realistic

49
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,320
or completely ridiculous we could apply

50
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,640
it to best case scenarios or worst case

51
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,240
scenarios

52
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,000
ultimately the actual future scenario

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,520
doesn't matter too much so

54
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,560
a good example would be that a fortune

55
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,920
500 company

56
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,680
imagines in five years time it becomes

57
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,119
the market leader

58
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,200
the focus isn't really about them being

59
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,560
the market leader in

60
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,320
in that kind of five-year period it's

61
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,000
actually working backwards to figure out

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,079
what are the policies and the strategies

63
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,880
that they

64
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,040
implemented to make sure that they were

65
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,240
that market leader

66
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,560
so it's really about reflecting on an

67
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,840
imagined scenario

68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,200
about what could have caused that to

69
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,599
occur so in that sense it's completely

70
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,080
different

71
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,480
to forecasting with forecasting we're

72
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,400
trying to accurately predict the future

73
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,160
we're looking at the data that we know

74
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,080
today and trying to extrapolate from

75
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,640
there

76
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,680
you know realistic trends um backcasting

77
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,400
we don't

78
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,239
really care too much about the accuracy

79
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,000
of that scenario it's more about that

80
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,959
reflective

81
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,280
and creative exercise of thinking what

82
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,840
could have caused that to

83
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,920
occur i think it's got a lot of untapped

84
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,879
potential

85
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,440
in cyber security now in some regards we

86
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,200
already do this we already imagine

87
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
uh future kind of network intrusions

88
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,640
when we think of some of those tabletop

89
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,920
exercises

90
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,319
however they are more intended as a

91
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,280
means to test

92
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,080
current capacity current preparedness i

93
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,920
think back casting takes a slightly more

94
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,200
strategic approach

95
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,800
imagine something maybe a bit further

96
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,040
down the line with the intention not to

97
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,599
test

98
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,440
immediate capacity to respond to a

99
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,680
crisis but more think about what could

100
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,879
have caused that certain

101
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,120
scenario to occur and allow

102
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,800
organizations to identify

103
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,560
either kind of variables policy

104
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,080
strategies that they might want to

105
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,879
implement

106
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,720
or be aware of ones that they might want

107
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,640
to avoid

108
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,239
i think the other reason that i'd say

109
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,720
that this is a good

110
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,640
communication tool or the reason i think

111
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,040
it's got a potential for cyber security

112
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,040
is because of that communication benefit

113
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,280
when you're creating an imagined future

114
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,560
when you're reflecting

115
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,319
on uh the sort of things that could have

116
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,080
caused that imagined future

117
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,360
it can be a very kind of a motive

118
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,040
experience but it can also help to

119
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,319
really kind of

120
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,959
get participants to visualize in a kind

121
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,159
of useful way so i think

122
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,480
all those reasons it can really be

123
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,840
applied to cyber security

124
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,319
quite effectively now i'm not the first

125
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,280
person

126
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,840
to argue this i've stolen this slide

127
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,439
from robert darnold's

128
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,799
sound cti summit talk in 2017

129
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,360
that i'd encourage all of you to take a

130
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,319
look at

131
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,120
and what rob does here is he imagines a

132
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,480
pharmaceutical company

133
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,720
that experiences a significant data

134
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,519
breach

135
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,439
which ultimately leads to a fall in

136
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,680
share price and ultimately the collapse

137
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,959
of a merger

138
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,959
now what i really like here is the way

139
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,720
that rob has blended

140
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,478
the business outcomes that you can see

141
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,079
on the right of that around media

142
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,639
coverage

143
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,440
the merger the messaging strategy it's

144
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,199
blended all of that with a much more

145
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,639
operational viewpoint

146
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,479
of the network intrusion itself and you

147
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,479
can see it's even dug into

148
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,800
what the entire attack life cycle might

149
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,680
look like

150
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,120
so this is a really good example where

151
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,960
we can use intelligence here

152
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,639
to really bring some color to what a

153
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,479
network intrusion might look like

154
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,240
and in fact in a kind of separate

155
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,520
example you could

156
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,720
see uh security functions using back

157
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
casting to imagine that they experience

158
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,360
network intrusion from a fret actor that

159
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,520
poses a relevant and viable threat

160
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,960
and then thinking actually in terms of

161
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,800
that tiger life cycle

162
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,199
what were the kind of likely ttps or

163
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,479
attack vectors

164
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,479
that would have allowed that network

165
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,680
intrusion to be successful

166
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,160
and i thought that since this year

167
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,080
hasn't really been gloomy enough already

168
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,919
i thought we would ramp it up a little

169
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,000
today so i thought what if instead of

170
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,840
applying back casting

171
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,960
to a cyber attack what if we applied it

172
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,320
to the demise

173
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,039
of the cti industry itself so what i

174
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:25,680
want to do

175
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,320
is really go through the 2020s and

176
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,600
understand what happened

177
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,080
what caused that uh that demise at the

178
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,360
end

179
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,000
the good news however is that it wasn't

180
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,120
all gloomy

181
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,400
and so the current year is 2023 and this

182
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
was actually a really encouraging time

183
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,639
a lot of the established cti

184
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,000
organizations

185
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,720
were doing really well it was

186
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,240
encouraging growth throughout this

187
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,440
period

188
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,520
and what that led to is a lot of new

189
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,639
startups

190
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,639
um getting really positive attention

191
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,759
from funders who'd

192
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,400
seen the industry's success and wanted

193
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,720
to kind of fuel it even more

194
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,400
at this point the industry also started

195
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,319
to professionalize so here we're talking

196
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:06,960
about

197
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,560
new educational programs certifications

198
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,800
industry understanding of what best

199
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,759
practice

200
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,160
and sort of common standards might start

201
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,199
to look like

202
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,360
all of that was starting to really kind

203
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,560
of crystallize

204
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,039
build up

205
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
and the good news is that the the kind

206
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,039
of happy times continued for a good

207
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,080
while yet

208
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,560
uh this was 2025 which was really my

209
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,160
favorite time and what i call the

210
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,440
champagne years

211
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,840
there was a lot of ipos at this time so

212
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,720
clearly a lot of

213
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,120
drinks receptions a lot of yachts being

214
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,720
purchased at the time

215
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,319
it was all pretty wolf of wall street if

216
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,840
you ask me but at

217
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,600
this point i think everyone working in

218
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
the cyber intelligence industry

219
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,520
felt pretty invincible it seemed like

220
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,199
the good years were going to continue

221
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:51,599
for

222
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,440
the foreseeable future yet by 2028

223
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,160
there was a real rude awakening sales

224
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,319
had really started to decline

225
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,680
there was a lack of interest in cti now

226
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,759
um a lot of those professional bodies

227
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,199
had started to disappear

228
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,759
or become very quiet and i think a lot

229
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,360
of organizations at this point

230
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,680
were maybe up for renewal and were

231
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,039
deciding maybe they were going to park

232
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:15,599
company

233
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,880
with their cti provider

234
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,919
and unfortunately by 2030 the cti

235
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,599
industry had completely disappeared

236
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,919
there were no conferences to speak of

237
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,840
most people working in the industry

238
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,240
had completely either completely checked

239
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,199
out and gone to

240
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,120
live in a cabin in the woods or had

241
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,720
simply transitioned into

242
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,639
other cyber security functions such as

243
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,840
red teaming or incident response

244
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,759
so the point here is really to try and

245
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,880
dissect the crash

246
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,520
and understand why the industry demised

247
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,560
and i'd say here

248
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,080
well i'd stress here that this isn't

249
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,599
intended as a hit job

250
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,000
um i love the cti industry i think it's

251
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,160
a really exciting space to be in

252
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,720
the point here is as i said it's not

253
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,599
forecasting

254
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,879
it's back casting so the emphasis is on

255
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,879
saying if this were to happen

256
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,440
what could have caused this and in doing

257
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,000
so

258
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
we're hopefully able to identify some

259
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,360
banana skins

260
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,280
in the industry or at least issues to be

261
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,720
aware of even if they're

262
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,960
you know it's potentially unlikely to

263
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,759
cause the demise of the industry

264
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,919
but the first thing that caused the

265
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,560
industry to collapse by 2030

266
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,039
was this notion of a distorted threat

267
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,120
landscape so the fret landscape we were

268
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,120
presenting to organizations

269
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,400
wasn't particularly accurate and that

270
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,399
was for a few reasons

271
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,599
first of all there was a real focus on

272
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,919
novelty so the threats were exaggerated

273
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,839
but we're really looking at what's new

274
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,279
and that's because that played well in

275
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,320
the medium

276
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,240
so the media understandably doesn't want

277
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,480
to report on yet another generic

278
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,000
phishing email

279
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,200
they're interested in something that's a

280
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,600
bit unique but that meant we placed too

281
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,480
much premium

282
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,120
on novelty so whether that was deploying

283
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,040
flashy zero-day exploits

284
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,040
or using maybe kind of some niche mine

285
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
to attack techniques that

286
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,760
aren't used too often that really gained

287
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,080
a disproportionate amount of attention

288
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,920
of course it was important to kind of do

289
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,600
a bit of horizon scanning

290
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,360
uh look at these kind of novel attack

291
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,839
vectors but because of that media angle

292
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,720
we placed far too much of a premium on

293
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,760
those kind of

294
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,279
new areas the second area

295
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,640
or the second kind of reason that the

296
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,800
fret landscape was distorted was due to

297
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,680
those

298
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,120
fear-based narratives cti pitches

299
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,839
frequently overemphasized the threats

300
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,240
posed

301
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,120
prospects and this became an

302
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,720
increasingly dated view because i think

303
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,880
most organizations by 2020

304
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
have started to take cyber security very

305
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,320
seriously indeed

306
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,000
they didn't necessarily need someone

307
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
stoking those fears anymore or kind of

308
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,600
helping them to wake up to the threat i

309
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,040
think that kind of process had

310
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,040
already started to to happen

311
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,200
finally the fat landscape was also

312
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,240
distorted by

313
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,279
analysts owed and pet interests now i

314
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,160
think it's something that makes the

315
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,920
industry great is just how much passion

316
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,640
there is

317
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,160
how many people are pursuing things that

318
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,920
they're interested in and this should

319
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,279
all this should all be encouraged it's

320
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:07,920
all really

321
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,399
you know all really exciting however

322
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,760
there is always

323
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,240
that risk that it kind of distorts the

324
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,839
threat landscape in a way

325
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,040
there's a lot of people interested in

326
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,560
very specific issues whether that's the

327
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,680
geopolitical

328
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,519
nexus maybe it's very kind of niche

329
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,959
technical areas

330
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,480
want to be looking at those but we don't

331
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,920
want to exaggerate their thread just

332
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,279
because we're interested in them we want

333
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,560
to be much more objective

334
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,880
we'll skip the slide there the second

335
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,000
reason that the

336
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
industry collapsed was because

337
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,279
intelligence teams were really

338
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,600
operating in isolation so by 2030

339
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,640
cti teams were largely siloed from

340
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,440
other cyber security processes they

341
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,959
typically operated almost as a

342
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,480
standalone function

343
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,560
so we'd have these really well written

344
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,240
threat intelligence reports that would

345
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,040
be produced on a variety of topics

346
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,920
but the audience of these reports wasn't

347
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,760
ever really clearly formulated it was

348
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,320
almost

349
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,600
intelligence for the sake of

350
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,480
intelligence so cti teams they weren't

351
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,079
they weren't asking the right questions

352
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,320
they weren't working with the broader

353
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,160
function to say how can we help

354
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,760
the vulnerability management or the

355
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,440
patch prioritization team

356
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,120
how can we help the security operation

357
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,040
team how can we facilitate better rent

358
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,760
teaming

359
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,360
weren't kind of making those connections

360
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,320
they weren't building those

361
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
relationships

362
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,440
cti teams also isolated themselves from

363
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,399
the broader business and the kind of

364
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,839
operations running outside of the

365
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,279
security team

366
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,920
and this led to really real missed

367
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,959
opportunities

368
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,079
for cti to become really embedded

369
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,160
in what would have been highly strategic

370
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,000
organizational functions

371
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,440
so you might for instance have a risk

372
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,760
management team that's exploring

373
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
everything from the outlook of entering

374
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,839
a new market to the hazards

375
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,880
of outsourcing manufacturing to a new

376
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,079
country

377
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,120
but those kind of broader risk

378
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,360
management teams weren't even aware

379
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,600
that their organization had a cti

380
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,959
function

381
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,320
finally cti had a dismissive and almost

382
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,240
snobby culture i think if you didn't

383
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,000
really understand cyber security

384
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,360
too well if you're maybe a kind of

385
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,440
senior executive

386
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
you were kind of dismissed it was kind

387
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,720
of seen that you had to have this quite

388
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
high bar to actually engage with

389
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,600
cti a lot of those kind of questions

390
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,440
more generic questions were kind of

391
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,760
treated as if it was below the cti team

392
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,040
when they were kind of presented to them

393
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,880
the third reason that the industry

394
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,240
collapsed was

395
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,079
due to a talent shortage and it really

396
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,279
became clear

397
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,480
by 2030 that the industry had failed to

398
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,760
overcome the

399
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,120
industry's kind of chronic skill

400
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,279
shortage if you like now this had a

401
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,399
dramatic effect

402
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,959
uh both on the work being produced so

403
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,560
without enough people

404
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,399
under resource cti teams inevitably

405
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,600
missed warning signals made mistakes uh

406
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,920
took shortcuts for instance but secondly

407
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,839
the skill shortage also took a really

408
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:00,560
heavy toll

409
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,120
on those working within the ctr industry

410
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,680
so if you're an overstretched analyst

411
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,360
you maybe struggle to maintain a

412
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,279
work-life balance maybe not getting

413
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,240
enough sleep

414
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,360
working weekends you have this kind of

415
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,200
ever-growing pile of intelligence

416
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,399
requests

417
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,200
and actually a 2030 study found that the

418
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,000
skill shortage

419
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,320
was one of the most significant yet

420
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,079
potentially underestimated and under

421
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,200
discussed

422
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,519
contributors to both burnout and mental

423
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,279
health issues within the cyber security

424
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,600
industry

425
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,519
and this talent shortage was really

426
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,240
caused by three different factors

427
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,480
first recruitment was based solely on

428
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,519
technical disciplines

429
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,360
it was really kind of looking at who

430
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,199
actually had understood cyber security

431
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,959
at that technical level

432
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,800
the industry didn't have a wider

433
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
aperture when recruiting

434
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,360
narrowed the pool of candidates also

435
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,800
meant that the quality of the work being

436
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,000
done was quite kind of narrowly focused

437
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,519
second the private sector was too

438
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,600
passive in fostering talent

439
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,360
so there was a lot of calls for

440
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,120
governments to introduce new cyber

441
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,079
security

442
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,279
degrees and apprenticeships improve

443
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,199
school curricular to make sure that

444
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,120
cyber security was

445
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,600
you know included and all of those are

446
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,360
certainly important initiatives

447
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,800
but the private sector kind of failed to

448
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,560
take any ownership over this

449
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,880
skill shortage they kept recruiting uh

450
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,000
for positions

451
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,279
required to say two to three years

452
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,519
experience they weren't willing to say

453
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,760
take on entry level uh position

454
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,600
entry-level candidates and actually

455
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,120
teach them some fundamental skills

456
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,120
finally there was a lack of support for

457
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
non-profits in academia

458
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,040
many of which are really important

459
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,560
contributors to

460
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,839
helping new talent get involved in the

461
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,279
industry

462
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,279
finally there were a few market

463
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,320
conditions that led to

464
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,279
the demise of the industry ultimately as

465
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,240
the industry grew

466
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,519
and more cti vendors got involved it

467
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,279
became a more crowded marketplace

468
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,440
it's made this you know narrowed margins

469
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,760
made it more difficult to compete

470
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,519
there was also rise of vendors across

471
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,000
the globe we started seeing

472
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,800
cti shops uh pop up in places like south

473
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,000
america

474
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,480
more in the middle east southeast asia

475
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,160
uh india etc

476
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,480
and what we actually found is that these

477
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,320
vendors had different kind of telemetry

478
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,839
a different perspective

479
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,760
um and a lot of organizations really

480
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,279
liked that it really resonated with them

481
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,360
that they had a different perspective

482
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,600
yield a different kind of insight that

483
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,040
they found

484
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,000
really useful i think finally we also

485
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
saw a rise of specialist firms during

486
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,720
this time

487
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,240
so at the moment while we have a lot of

488
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,519
journalist firms by 2030 we had cti

489
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,120
vendors that were really focused on say

490
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,959
just the financial services

491
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,440
or just industrial control systems that

492
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,240
gave them that

493
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,600
that real kind of niche uh steep subject

494
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,440
matter expertise and that that also

495
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
resonated a lot that ultimately made the

496
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,639
whole industry

497
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,320
a much more competitive much much

498
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,279
tougher environment

499
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,800
so having kind of discussed those

500
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
reasons what i want to do now is shift

501
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,519
gears

502
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,120
and discuss how the fall of cti

503
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,600
might be prevented and the good news is

504
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,639
while it does seem a bit gloomy in 2030

505
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,079
good news is that technology had

506
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,079
improved by this time so we're actually

507
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,040
in 2030

508
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,160
able to create a time travelling machine

509
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,199
and we use this to send arnie back in

510
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:23,839
time

511
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,279
to try and give us some of some of these

512
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,279
lessons in terms of how we could uh

513
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,600
protect the cti industry's growth and

514
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,839
allow it to be a sustainable industry

515
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,839
so arnie had quite a few bits of bits

516
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,440
and pieces to kind of say to us

517
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,920
but the first thing arnie suggested is

518
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,560
that he may

519
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,279
you know for us to all make sure that in

520
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,160
the intelligence

521
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,399
products we produce that we provide

522
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,519
really practical

523
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,000
advice so that means a few things but

524
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,519
first of all it means

525
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,320
having a clear so what in intelligence

526
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,759
products

527
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,720
and external content so really kind of

528
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,440
focusing

529
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,240
on why this matters if it's say an

530
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,680
analyst's pet interest

531
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,680
that's great but how does that translate

532
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,760
into an organization cyber security

533
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,400
function

534
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,640
and the concerns that they're thinking

535
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,480
about so this kind of content really

536
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,520
helped to

537
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,640
uh gravitate uh discussion in a kind of

538
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,039
client or a stakeholder's kind of

539
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,559
context for instance

540
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,359
um and i think one way to do this was

541
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,039
providing really clear practical

542
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,160
advice uh and actionable steps so that

543
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,599
fear-based narrative had got a bit kind

544
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:27,839
of

545
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,520
dull but actually if we were able to

546
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,280
provide practical advice whether that's

547
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
mitigation steps

548
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,559
other kind of bits and pieces that

549
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,039
organizations should be thinking about

550
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,080
that became a much more interesting and

551
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,840
useful call to action

552
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,440
rather than kind of promoting fear

553
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,679
uncertainty and doubt

554
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,840
i think related to that there was that

555
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,160
real need to provide perspective

556
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,720
over panic and what i mean by that is

557
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
that there's really just no shortage

558
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,039
of different threat factors that

559
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,320
organizations

560
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,919
you know might feel they need to worry

561
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,160
about yet between say

562
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,200
phishing on the one hand and ai enabled

563
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,160
offense

564
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,799
um there's all these different attack

565
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,840
factors but they

566
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,280
you know they pose significantly

567
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,840
different threats and something like

568
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,919
ai enabled attacks might seem really

569
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,840
interesting but actually it's it's

570
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,559
phishing that

571
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,640
uh that presents you know the real

572
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,600
concern

573
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,919
for almost every organization so being

574
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,360
able to provide that perspective

575
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,039
and actually sort through the noise to

576
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,960
identify what are the key threats

577
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,280
that was really important and related to

578
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,559
that was that

579
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,160
that willingness to actually downplay

580
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,000
threats so organizations were

581
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,880
increasingly

582
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,880
not particularly interested in the 200

583
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,919
threats

584
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,520
that they might need to be worried about

585
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,640
what they're actually interested in on

586
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,000
what the most important

587
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,440
five or ten things that we should be

588
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
doing uh based on the kind of the fret

589
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
landscape and the relevant threat actors

590
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,280
activity now the second thing that arnie

591
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,160
really encouraged

592
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,240
us all to be thinking about is adopting

593
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,760
that collaborative

594
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,840
approach so i've already discussed this

595
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,160
but cti should be applied across a cyber

596
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,679
security function

597
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,160
and also aligned with a broader business

598
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,039
strategy

599
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,120
and i think the key here is to really

600
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,600
make sure that cti is integrated

601
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,120
and overlaps with all those different

602
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,280
errors so it's kind of part of

603
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,440
uh incident response it's part of red

604
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
teaming the intelligence is feeding into

605
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,360
those areas it's feeding into

606
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,280
prioritizing different vulnerabilities

607
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,720
for instance and if it's

608
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,880
if it's got that overlap and if it's if

609
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,039
the distinctions between say cti

610
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,919
and other components of a cyber security

611
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:32,559
function

612
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,320
become blurry that's actually really

613
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,600
good news and it means that

614
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,840
cti is kind of informing those processes

615
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,200
the other thing only said on this

616
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,120
collaborative approach is to

617
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,679
integrate feedback effectively but also

618
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,640
view the process

619
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,039
as a two-way street so i think in the

620
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:49,919
short time that the

621
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,919
ctr industry has been around it's really

622
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,600
excelled at developing

623
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,520
you know really nuanced well thought out

624
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,720
reports uh

625
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,039
have all sorts of detail but actually

626
00:19:59,039 --> 00:19:59,919
we're not doing

627
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,720
too much of actually understanding if um

628
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,440
if our

629
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,280
intelligent stakeholders are actually

630
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,960
consuming that intelligence in useful

631
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,840
ways

632
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,679
that means that uh intelligence

633
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,000
capability development is a huge issue

634
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,440
and one we really need to start

635
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,400
prioritizing but on this

636
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,320
the the kind of the real experts when it

637
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,400
comes to intelligence are the analysts

638
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,039
are those cti teams themselves so when

639
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,159
it comes to feedback

640
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,400
yes we want to consult stakeholders

641
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,080
understand their concerns

642
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,120
understand where they think that

643
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,640
intelligence products could maybe be

644
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,919
improved

645
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,280
but also shouldn't be afraid of

646
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,120
providing feedback on what those

647
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,720
stakeholders could do themselves to

648
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,840
actually improve

649
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,880
uh their ability to consume and utilize

650
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,520
intelligence

651
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,919
another thing that arnie suggested was

652
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,400
to embrace intelligence as

653
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,960
an educational tool so of course this

654
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,760
means

655
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,159
uh engaging with intelligence consumers

656
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,440
you know really listening

657
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,720
uh to the sort of things they were

658
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,039
interested in um and making sure that

659
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,000
intelligence kind of

660
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,480
you know fits their use cases but it

661
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,159
also means striving to create

662
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,440
a more approachable atmosphere

663
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,679
and part of that means you know adopting

664
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,960
that kind of no stupid

665
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
questions approach i previously spoke

666
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,000
about how

667
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,039
the cti industry can appear a bit snobby

668
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,080
and i think it's really important that

669
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
we kind of get beyond uh

670
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,919
that kind of culture you know i see a

671
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,000
lot of people uh they make kind of jokes

672
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,840
about people that think say blockchain

673
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,799
or ai

674
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,200
you know pose these really scary threats

675
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,320
now that's fine

676
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,679
when it comes to kind of potentially

677
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,520
bogus or questionable marketing that

678
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,559
kind of really ramps up

679
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,480
fears but actually when it comes to

680
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,000
someone that's maybe just a little bit

681
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,760
ignorant about cyber security

682
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,000
and they've maybe read an article that

683
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,360
does kind of

684
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,760
stoke fears um that's actually not

685
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,360
anything to laugh at that's someone that

686
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,120
we wouldn't expect necessarily to know a

687
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,880
lot about cyber security if it's say

688
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,200
an executive um there's not actually

689
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,799
anything particularly funny about

690
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,640
about that situation and what we want to

691
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,640
make sure is that we're actually really

692
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,919
helping those people

693
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,440
uh we're guiding them through the front

694
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,520
landscape helping them to understand

695
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,080
maybe this isn't such a big issue you

696
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,600
know we maybe shouldn't spend all our

697
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,080
time

698
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,159
worried about blockchain attacks maybe

699
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,600
actually we want to

700
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,120
instead invest in these kind of key

701
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,520
areas and actually intelligence teams

702
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,880
might find

703
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,720
that they are able to make much more of

704
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,120
an impact when working with those

705
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,840
more ignorant use use cases or users

706
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,799
just because they can

707
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,120
just very quickly really ramp up their

708
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,080
understanding

709
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,360
in a short kind of space of time

710
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,440
finally it's going to be vital to build

711
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,960
that pipeline so i've already spoken

712
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,000
about a lot of this

713
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,320
it's about training talent internally

714
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,000
it's embracing embracing that variety

715
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,600
of skill sets so if you want to be an

716
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,000
accountant uh or a lawyer

717
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,520
uh you can kind of you know you can go

718
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,440
and do english literature or geography

719
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,480
or biology

720
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
as your undergraduate degree and then

721
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,240
kind of transition into those

722
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,720
career paths i think the same should be

723
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,360
said of

724
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,440
cyber security we should have that kind

725
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
of wider aperture when we come to

726
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,159
recruitment

727
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,360
and that of course does mean that we're

728
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,720
willing to kind of provide a bit more

729
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,360
support

730
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,679
for those entry level positions i think

731
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,400
the other thing

732
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,120
here that's maybe not considered enough

733
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,600
is

734
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,919
around career path transparency and

735
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,440
that's because if i did want to be an

736
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,159
accountant

737
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,640
a lawyer a banker say i was a university

738
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,600
student i could go

739
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,440
to a career guidance counsellor and say

740
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,039
i'm interested in these career paths

741
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,240
and that guidance counselor would be

742
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,840
able to provide all sorts of different

743
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,480
pdfs or career guides on you know how to

744
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,559
get started in banking etc

745
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,159
now if you go to a career guidance

746
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,000
counselor and say i want to be

747
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,320
a red team consultant i want to be a cti

748
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,120
analyst

749
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,240
you're probably going to get a very

750
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,320
confused look uh on the on

751
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,400
behalf of that kind of career guidance

752
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,600
council for instance

753
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,919
so that means there isn't that broader

754
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,840
information about how to get started in

755
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,440
cti

756
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,720
there isn't an understanding of how

757
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,320
these career paths work and that's

758
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,840
partly because they're immature right

759
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,720
now

760
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,480
and they're not clearly formulated but i

761
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,919
think one thing that organizations can

762
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,360
do is actually provide a lot more

763
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,400
resource

764
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,120
on their blogs uh on you know develop

765
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,080
white papers

766
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,080
that suggest the sort of things that

767
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,400
students aspiring ct analysts could be

768
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,120
doing

769
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,039
um what's been useful what are the sort

770
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,640
of things they're looking for

771
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,080
and that just creates that level playing

772
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,600
field and makes it easier to get into

773
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,200
the industry if you're aware of the sort

774
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,080
of skills

775
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,679
that you need so i want to finish

776
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,320
on a few points um you know clearly i

777
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,520
don't think the industry is about to

778
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,480
collapse

779
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,320
um and i have taken a bit of creative

780
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
freedom uh here with that kind of demise

781
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,440
scenario

782
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,360
but i hope you will agree that even if

783
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,559
it's unrealistic

784
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,000
and even if the kind of factors i've

785
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,080
talked about are unlikely to lead to the

786
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,600
demise of the industry

787
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,279
there is a grain of truth at least in

788
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,720
some of the issues i've talked about and

789
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,760
it's actually going to be really

790
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,039
important that we do take

791
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,440
some of those issues really seriously in

792
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,039
the next few years

793
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,960
and i think part of this is to do with

794
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,880
ctri being quite a young industry

795
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,960
that means a it's vital to guard against

796
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,720
complacency and while

797
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,320
it's you know currently quite a popular

798
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,159
offering and we're enjoying a lot of

799
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:58,880
growth

800
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,799
and there's no guarantee that that is

801
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,240
going to be the case in a decade

802
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,600
so really thinking about what are those

803
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,159
banana skins but also just being really

804
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,440
reflective

805
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,440
as an industry is going to be really

806
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,480
important

807
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,640
and i think on this when i go to those

808
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,240
cti conferences and you know

809
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,320
i enjoy learning more about fret actors

810
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,000
and developments in the fret landscape

811
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,279
i think that definitely needs to

812
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,520
continue being an important component

813
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,159
of uh you know the different forum

814
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,159
conferences that we all attend

815
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,600
but i actually think because it's this

816
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,840
young industry um it's also going to be

817
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,039
important that we have these sorts of

818
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,080
discussions

819
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,159
about whether it's how we adopt a

820
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,919
collaborative approach how we build the

821
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,279
cti pipeline

822
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,360
so what i what i'm hoping is that as the

823
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,960
industry matures we start to have

824
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,200
more of those sorts of conversations uh

825
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,480
feature in those

826
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,039
in the kind of conference circuit

827
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,880
another important point is that a few

828
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,480
bad apples can support the barrel and

829
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,919
what i mean here

830
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,039
is that it only takes a few cti vendors

831
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,159
to maybe

832
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,200
stoke fear or have that snobby attitude

833
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,640
all those sorts of problems i've maybe

834
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,799
discussed and that can actually tarnish

835
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,840
the entire

836
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,480
industry's reputation so i think when it

837
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,440
comes to that

838
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,799
it's going to be really important that

839
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,559
the industry starts to kind of

840
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,120
clarify what our best practice is what

841
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,640
does a good cti

842
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
organization look like what does a good

843
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,520
cti function look like etc

844
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,360
and i think finally i've talked about

845
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,559
those wider discussions and the

846
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,080
importance of kind of looking at where

847
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,279
the industry is

848
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,360
i hope that various industry and

849
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,960
community bodies whether that's virus

850
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,480
bulletin whether that's sans

851
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,320
if it's crest i hope that they can all

852
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,720
play an important role
