6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,039
discuss the ta505 threat group

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,880
which is conducting a massive cyber

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,439
attack on a global scale

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,640
it first appeared in 2014 and delivered

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,960
a large-scale attack against the entire

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,440

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,840
i worked in the unlab mariner analysis

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,280
team

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,680
i'm interested in malware analysis

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,000
especially in thorough analysis of the

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,320
algorithms used by marielle

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,680
and in tracking down threat groups also

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,520
i am in the main author of the threat

42

security work in the financial sector

62
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,720
this is the table of content to be

63
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,560
presented

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,640
today we are going to discuss the result

65
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,040
of profiling

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,840
the ta505 distributed by the d8505

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,720
threat group

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,200
the statistical data analysis of spear

69
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,239
pc emails

70
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,160
distributed to the korean financial

71
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,120
sector collected by the fsi

72
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,599
analysis on the association for the pin

73
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,560
7 group

74
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,720
which has a similar flow to the ta-505

75
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,080
the recent trends of the ta-505 regroup

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,400
which are currently attacking overseas

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,480
and ways to effectively respond to the

78
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,159
attacks of these ta505 threat groups

79
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,560
first of all let's look at the profiling

80
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,120
results of the ta505 threat group

81
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,640
since the earlier hybrid 2019 a massive

82
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,480
cyber attacks targeting the domestic

83
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,760
financial sector

84
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,040
have continued to occur a large volume

85
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,480
of spear-kissing mirrors

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,760
cleverly disguised as invoices resumes

87
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,400
air tickets and tech skills were being

88
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,799
sent

89
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,959
out to corporate executives and

90
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,360
employees to induce infection

91
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,519
malware infection can lead to a leakage

92
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,920
of critical information from companies

93
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,760
or a serious damage on encrypting

94
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,879
critical files related to their work

95
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,000
da 505 which you're discussing today

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,959
is a group observed behind the 2019

97
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:51,760
cyber tech

98
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,599
on the domestic financial sector

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,560
the a505 threat group has been carrying

100
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,799
out active attacks until recently

101
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,519
starting with murders or 3 decks for the

102
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,799
save of the financial information since

103
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:07,680
2014.

104
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,840
it mainly attacked by nature and energy

105
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,400
related industries by using lensome air

106
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,920
and remote controlled maria overseas

107
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,040
mostly it used spear piecing mirror to

108
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
spread more wear such as three decks

109
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,520
local ransomware flawed enemy and globe

110
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,479
ransomware

111
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,320
making massive attacks against south

112
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,159
korea from 2019.

113
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,960
now let's get acquainted with the text

114
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,840
strategies

115
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,479
techniques and procedures used by the ta

116
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,758
505 threat group

117
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,680
ta505 threat group disseminates murmur

118
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,600
to companies or organizations

119
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
such as financial institutions

120
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,919
manufacturing companies or hospitals

121
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,639
not to individuals successful attack

122
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,880
using the spear-facing metal may lead to

123
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,680
massive damage

124
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
spear-piercing male is sent with an open

125
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,440
subject tip which collects

126
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,680
information by spreading murmurs for the

127
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,360
sake of email addresses and

128
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,320
information a collected email addresses

129
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,400
can be used for auditions purposing

130
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,440
email attacks and

131
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,080
etc secondly techniques

132
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,520
malicious attachments from the

133
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,479
spear-piecing men sent by the ta505

134
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,199
circular

135
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,880
use various formats such as xl 4.0 macro

136
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,160
vba macro and html with encoded binaries

137
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,240
to by perfection detection

138
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,960
and parallel additional marker

139
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,280
downloading marker is also encoded to

140
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,120
bypass action detections

141
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,280
so that it acts as somewhere after

142
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,960
performing the decoding process

143
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,479
inside the memory malware then scans

144
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,560
work groups of infected pieces to

145
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,440
determine

146
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,120
whether they are individuals or

147
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,160
businesses if work group is deport value

148
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,280
of the work group

149
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,840
it stops malicious behavior and deletes

150
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,440
it by itself

151
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,360
if the ad server domain value is

152
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,680
returned it is judged to be a corporate

153
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,199
pc

154
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,520
if it is a corporate pc it attempts to

155
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,360
help the ad server using assembly

156
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,680
variabilities against the enterprise's

157
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,800
internal network

158
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,479
and using the additionally downloaded

159
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,440
headquarter covered strike

160
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,840
if it uses the ad server domain it

161
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,520
attempts to steer the id server

162
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,039
administrator account

163
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,360
and use the tiny map mirror to connect

164
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,759
the reverse share to the cnc

165
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,319
if an ad server administrator account is

166
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,039
captured

167
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,759
it uses an ad server administrator

168
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,160
account to propagate global ensemble to

169
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,520
internal network pieces

170
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,560
this figure shows the attack procedure

171
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,080
of the ta505 thread group

172
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,759
the initial infection begins with a

173
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,440
malicious fire execution

174
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,360
attached to the spear-piecing male

175
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,919
distributed to corporate executives and

176
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,440
employees

177
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,520
after the initial infection remote

178
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,440
controlled maria is downloaded

179
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,919
and information from the infected pc is

180
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,800
stolen

181
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,319
an additional malware is downloaded

182
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,800
then the internal network ad server

183
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,280
administrator account is taken over

184
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,520
through additional maria such as covert

185
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,000
strike and significant damage of course

186
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,840
due to internal network landsamer

187
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,318
infection

188
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,479
now in the second chapter we will

189
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,919
discuss the malware distributed by ta505

190
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,080
this picture shows a link to maria

191
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,080
circulated by ta505s regroup

192
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,720
the ta505 thread group attacks use

193
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,919
multiple mario

194
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,039
depending on the attack lifecycle chain

195
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,360
detailed analysis research on maria's

196
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,199
collected by the fsi

197
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,120
from pure piecing mirrors for initial

198
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,680
penetration to remote controlled mervier

199
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,840
to ransomware that is finally used to

200
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,240
impact the enterprise internal network

201
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,800
and related analysis of each malware was

202
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,120
prepared

203
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,680
i will briefly introduce each more layer

204
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,160
first

205
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
malicious document is attached to the

206
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
spear-piecing male and distributed in

207
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,360
order to download additional markers

208
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
flowed amy is remotely controlled more

209
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,199
rare that can steal infected pc

210
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,280
information and carry out additional

211
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,960
attacks

212
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,800
clone lensome air is the lesson we are

213
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,919
changing the extension to club

214
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,879
amadeus is exploitation of impacted pc

215
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,800
information and additional more

216
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,599
downloads can be carried out

217
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,840
image tailors there is email information

218
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,360
that exists on infected pcs

219
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,679
tinymad is a reverse share connection to

220
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,679
attacker server is available

221
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,440
depending on options that aren't enabled

222
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,159
lastly sdb both performs remote control

223
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,080
functions by injecting warrior into

224
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,959
normal service

225
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,680
but how can we assure that those marines

226
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,399
came from the ta505 threat group

227
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,399
let me tell you the four evidence i used

228
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,800
to judge

229
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,360
as shown in this picture the ta505

230
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,200
thread group has a common thread

231
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,800
and many mariners use the same packers

232
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,959
the process of creating encoded p

233
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,040
binaries with the final moral p

234
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,360
binaries after a step-by-step decoding

235
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,080
process

236
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,160
is a common feature found from warriors

237
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,080
distributed by the ta5050 group

238
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,399
this describes the process of operating

239
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,600
the packers used by the ta505s red group

240
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,680
i have briefly introduced the operation

241
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,920
process of the packer

242
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,240
malware allocates virtual areas using

243
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,399
the virtual log ex api

244
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,200
the value of the hard-coded 4 byte xor

245
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,720
key at a specific offset

246
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,800
in the data section and the encoding

247
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,760
share code present

248
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,080
at the offset immediately after the xr

249
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,920
key are then decoded

250
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,240
to the virtual memory allocated by

251
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,680
repeating the operation

252
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,959
through the rol4 algorithm

253
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,959
finally it is moved to the address of

254
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,959
the virtual memory where the decoded

255
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,000
circles exist

256
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,560
this figure shows the thai picker more

257
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,800
distributed by the ta-5 terrified

258
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,120
straight group

259
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,279
this figure shows the type picker more

260
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,600
distributed by the ta505

261
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,959
red group you can see that float amy

262
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,120
email stealer and club lenses mayor are

263
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,640
having the same unpacked routine

264
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,200
the second evidence the second evidence

265
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,120
is the repeated usage of

266
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,240
a typical valley digital signature

267
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,480
many other maria also uses valley

268
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,720
destroyer signatures to avoid vaccine

269
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,600
detection

270
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,560
however the ta505 circuit can be

271
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,120
identified by usage of the same digital

272
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,839
signature repeatedly unlike others

273
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,560
lord amy marrer and claude lanzamere

274
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,320
once distributed maria

275
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,200
with the same twister signer though the

276
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,920
signing time was different

277
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,079
in addition to these cases it was

278
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,000
confirmed that the number of warriors

279
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,600
distribute these mirrors

280
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,279
with the same digital signature

281
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,160
as a third evidence there was a case

282
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,000
where the cnc server downloaded

283
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,720
mauritius document files to store

284
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,200
the stolen information of claude amy

285
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,560
maria

286
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,320
in this case two mariners were

287
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,200
distributed from the same group

288
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,519
additionally it was confirmed that image

289
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,519
tailored and flown the enemy mirror

290
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,240
were downloaded from amadeus maria at

291
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,600
the same time

292
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,240
and tiny mad maria was downloaded

293
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,680
through slow day memorial

294
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,360
now let me tell you the lizard of

295
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,560
analyzing its warriors in more detail

296
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,640
float amy is a remote control model

297
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,959
created based on the leaked source code

298
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,360
of amy admin remote desktop software

299
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,720
version 3

300
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,040
which is used by more than 80 million

301
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,720
people

302
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,279
the most important issue was that they

303
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,880
were targeting companies

304
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,000
and as i said in the previous tdp they

305
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,839
searched the workflow of the pc to

306
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,839
determine whether it is the company

307
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,320
while analyzing a number of load amy

308
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,480
remote control mario samples

309
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,360
it was found that when cnc servers were

310
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,920
transmitting impacted pc information

311
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,279
many ips used the same ip band of the

312
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,959
hosting server

313
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,440
the ips used at this time are still

314
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,760
being used for ta505 attacks

315
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,240
next it's about club ransomware which

316
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,959
brings about 300 million dollars lost

317
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,920
when one impacts a company the dutch

318
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,600
university of maastricht

319
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,920
and ruruan general hospital in france

320
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,760
was once impacted by this club

321
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,360
ransomware

322
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,600
actually each operation process is not

323
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,839
significantly different from other

324
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,399
ransomware now

325
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,000
we are focused on techniques for

326
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,440
anti-virus detection

327
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,680
and bypass used by club ransomware

328
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,800
for weblut and panda vaccine windows

329
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,120
restore point deletion is not performed

330
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,240
under the presence of the process

331
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,120
if maria bite exists it is deleted by

332
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,320
executing the

333
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,279
uninstall program

334
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,560
if more real bites exist it is deleted

335
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,680
by executing the uninstall program

336
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,760
in the case of this set search for the

337
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,680
product code in the loop part

338
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,800
attack pass and

339
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,880
in the case of reset search for the

340
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,120
product code in the logo file attack

341
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,000
test and delete

342
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,600
it with the msifcc command

343
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,920
with cosmos kit presence changing the

344
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,399
extension to clock tool

345
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,480
in the case of unless the first process

346
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,440
is searched

347
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,000
and files with lenses mirror strings are

348
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
excluded from encryption

349
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,079
and jpg virus are excluded from

350
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,760
infection to bypass the decoy file

351
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,079
with the checkmark vaccine the only star

352
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:58,800
program is

353
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,120
executed but in response to this

354
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,240
treatment is changed

355
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,079
to enter the security code for deletion

356
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,000
in addition a looking to search for

357
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,680
megapi vaccine was added

358
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,839
in february of this year and it is

359
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,600
deleted with the msi exec command

360
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,920
also while tracking the club resonator

361
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,959
we discovered a new type of mirror

362
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,000
this small size maria used the ta505

363
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,199
customer packer

364
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,279
and has the same digital signature as

365
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,519
club landscaper

366
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,480
it neutralize msc and windows depender

367
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,720
which are basic vaccine provided by

368
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,240
microsoft so14 january 2020

369
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,639
microsoft and the technical support for

370
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,839
windows 7

371
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,600
this can be done later to companies

372
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,839
upgrade on their os to windows 10.

373
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,279
the following is the armada voltmeter

374
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,199
there is no significant difference from

375
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,480
general voldemort

376
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,399
except the research checking additional

377
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,519
maria on the cnc server of the ta-505

378
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,600
threat group

379
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,760
i was able to find the function code

380
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,240
showing the ta505 manages both

381
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,680
ids and test ids based on this it was

382
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,000
concluded that the infected pc is being

383
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,040
systemically

384
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,480
managed next is the image dealer

385
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,279
because of the first infection of da505

386
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,279
started with purposing emails

387
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,320
the ta-505 was concerned about securing

388
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,639
email addresses for corporate employees

389
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,560
it still is account information in the

390
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,639
past where outlook and thunderbird

391
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,639
related information is stored

392
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,120
collects the address book list lists the

393
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,480
file on the pc

394
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,880
versus the email addresses and sends it

395
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,680
to the attacker server

396
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,759
they will send spear piecing emails back

397
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,839
to the email address they collected

398
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,480
the tiny mad mario is distributed by

399
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,920
adding a more rare

400
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,079
self-deletion function to the population

401
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,680
source code of tinymed

402
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,440
0.2 version used delivers share of text

403
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,720
and packing it with the custom packer of

404
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,839
ta505

405
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,079
the pin service record which i will

406
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,959
explain later

407
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,440
also use the maria cord baby method that

408
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,000
change tiny match code

409
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,079
we will discuss it again in the session

410
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,160
of how it related to fin7

411
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,240
now it's about sdb board sdb board is on

412
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
barrier that uses application shimming

413
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,759
technique

414
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,759
the application shimmy technique used to

415
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,000
reserve application compatibility

416
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,720
issues allows allows the application to

417
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,560
modify the program code by

418
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,959
inserting the share code specified in

419
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,240
the sim database

420
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,720
before it is invoked from the window at

421
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,680
the time of an iata course

422
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,000
this is the technology that warrior open

423
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,680
used to maintain continuity

424
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,160
the operation process of stp bone marrow

425
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,240
is shown in this figure

426
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,079
it uses the application streaming

427
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,160
technique to maintain persistence

428
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,240
and features more detailed functions

429
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,679
that can be performed while

430
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,600
communicating with the attacker server

431
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,839
i will explain in more detail the

432
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,919
application seeming technique used by

433
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,039
sdb board

434
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,119
when the dln file downloaded from the

435
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,119
attacker server is executed

436
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,599
the malicious sdb is installed and the

437
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,359
malaysian sharecode is stored in the

438
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,880
registry

439
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,039
after that whenever the service process

440
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,160
or normal process

441
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,640
is executed a specific function of the

442
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,840
service process is

443
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,600
replaced with malicious share codes

444
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,200
stored in the registry

445
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,280
and the marker operates accordingly

446
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,200
let's take a closer look at this concept

447
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,840
when checking the malicious sdb with sdb

448
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,720
explorer

449
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,640
every time a specific function of

450
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,400
service is executed

451
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,799
it is replaced with the malicious share

452
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,160
code in the lower left corner this

453
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,000
malicious share code is stored in the

454
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,640
registry

455
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,600
we just went over the malwares

456
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,640
distributed by ta505

457
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,480
i understand it was a little bit

458
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,720
complicated concept

459
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,880
as a depression let's take a look at the

460
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,400
statistics collected on the

461
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,840
spear-piecing emails

462
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,160
distributed by ta505

463
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,799
this is the basis on an analysis of

464
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,640
around 100

465
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,160
of times of the ta505s regroups domestic

466
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,840
targets prpc emails

467
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,160
collected from virustotal from february

468
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,320
to december

469
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,400
2019. according to the monthly

470
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,640
classification of the spear-piecing mail

471
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,919
and analysis on the average time spent

472
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,799
on sanding it has been confirmed that

473
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,600
the ta-505 regular sphere-piecing mill

474
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,160
is concentrated in a time period of

475
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,640
around

476
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,679
2 hours from 7 am to 9 am in korean

477
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,559
standard time

478
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,840
this shows day-to-day statistics on the

479
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,000
spread of spear-facing mill to local

480
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,720
financial forms by the ta-505 threat

481
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,200
group

482
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,080
in 2019 that were detected by the

483
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,080
financial security control center

484
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,840
of the korean financial security

485
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,240
institute

486
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,280
analysis on total of 600

487
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,520
thousand and twenty one's pure pissing

488
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,400
metal cases

489
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,400
from first of february 2019 to 31st of

490
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,000
december 2019

491
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,520
revealed that about 81 percent of

492
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,760
earth's purposing mail were sent out on

493
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,600
weekdays

494
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,480
statistics also showed that ta505s

495
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,200
regroup

496
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,440
generally spreads purposing mail before

497
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,280
9 am on weekdays

498
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,000
which is the usual office hour for local

499
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,039
executives and employees

500
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,080
this lizard proves that da505 has an

501
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,559
ability to identify the time zone with

502
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,200
the highest

503
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,520
infection rate and use it to attack by

504
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,360
sending purposing mail to

505
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,360
executives and employees of domestic

506
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,559
companies on the

507
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,000
corresponding time period

508
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,159
now in chapter 4 let's look at the

509
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,400
connection between ta505

510
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,799
and pin 7. pin 7 is a threat group that

511
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,880
has been carrying out attacks on u.s

512
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,600
retailers

513
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,320
restaurants and lodging businesses since

514
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,480
mid

515
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,600
2015. like the th505 threat group

516
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,919
it uses solution language to spread more

517
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,120
earlier through spherp signals

518
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,880
the ultimate goal is to capture

519
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,480
financial information through

520
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,080
point-of-sale post-more rare

521
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,799
distribution

522
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,120
this picture shows the cyber attack

523
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,240
lifecycle presented by fire eye

524
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,400
the analysis found that two groups were

525
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,720
very similar in census cerebral eyepiece

526
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,960
cyber object life cycle and the more

527
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,280
used at each stage

528
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,440
thus we will discuss the result of the

529
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,440
analysis on the link between

530
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,280
five tier five and pin seven thread

531
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,360
group based on this life cycle

532
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,400
first we found common ground in early

533
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,880
presentation to obvious microsoft office

534
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,799
document files

535
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,200
both groups disseminate malicious

536
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,919
documents

537
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,400
including malicious macro code via their

538
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,440
spear-basing male

539
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,840
intruding into the target system

540
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,960
second we both use detectors called vlan

541
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,039
amy and copper strike in the stage of

542
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,679
securing the put port

543
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,919
the cnc server of covert strike and

544
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,159
inverter asian test tool

545
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,480
is expressed as steam server and the

546
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,760
victim pc is expressed as bitcoin

547
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,919
the copper strike was first discovered

548
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,240
during an analysis on the hacked pc by

549
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,240
the ta505s record

550
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,640
in february 2019. in addition a security

551
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,880
firm called bookseed released a list of

552
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,440
cover strike steam servers on github

553
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,159
confirming that some of the ips used as

554
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,520
cnc servers by the ti-505 circuit which

555
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:05,919
is

556
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,720
matched the list

557
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,600
third it is assumed that in case of

558
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,039
elevating privileges

559
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,679
mimikatz which eliminates privileges as

560
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,840
one of the functions provided by copper

561
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,840
strike was used

562
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,400
the failed to launch mimi string inside

563
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,559
the flow damien remote controlled mario

564
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,280
shows that the elevation of privileges

565
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,960
was attempted through mini cuts

566
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,120
first the batch script was used for

567
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,200
internal reconnaissance

568
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,360
both threat groups used the network scan

569
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,600
features batch script to identify

570
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,880
active domains tips

571
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,320
rdp and pse excc were used for internal

572
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,760
diffusion

573
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,000
the remote control share code of sdb

574
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,960
volume ware distributed by the ta-505

575
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,760
threat group

576
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,840
includes the ability to activate and

577
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,199
install remote testers

578
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,320
sixth sim database and tinymade are used

579
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,400
to maintain connection

580
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,960
the fin7 drag group is known to use the

581
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,080
tiny mad maria

582
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,280
known as baby matar and the ta505 threat

583
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,440
group also used the tiny map maria to

584
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,000
connect to the cnc server from an

585
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,280
infected hissy in addition it was

586
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,240
disclosed in

587
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,520
fire eye in 2017 that the fin 7's red

588
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,520
group used sim database to install

589
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,960
remote controlled maria

590
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,480
and to maintain continuity

591
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,120
lastly the attacker disseminates more

592
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,080
rares to multiple

593
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,000
pieces through both cyber attack life

594
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,360
cycle

595
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,520
in the case of n7 circuit it

596
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,799
disseminates the pulse maria where the

597
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,159
ta505 threat group disseminates the

598
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,440
globe ransomware in the end

599
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,320
in addition the cncip used by the fin7

600
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,679
group was identified

601
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,400
in part of matching the ta505 threat

602
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,360
group's cnc

603
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,880
server ip in the fifth chapter let's

604
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,799
take a look at the listener tech trend

605
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,840
of the ta505

606
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,320
recently pure piecing emails attached to

607
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,400
html files to induce

608
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,600
additional more download when the html

609
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,320
file is executed it shows a fake loading

610
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,799
page for downloaded as shown in these

611
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,559
pictures

612
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,799
and the simple javascript code lists to

613
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,679
the page for

614
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,880
actual download in addition to this

615
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,120
there was also an html file that was

616
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,039
connected to the download page by

617
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,679
entering a simple arithmetic operation

618
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,320
value as a captcha code

619
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,039
and such html files are being used and

620
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,880
attempts to avoid the recipient's

621
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,080
suspicion

622
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,679
and to bypass vaccine detection

623
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,840
additional download is usually an excel

624
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,720
file and when

625
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,760
executing the exact file the dll file of

626
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
the remote control function is dropped

627
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,559
and executed

628
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,559
now let's look at how we can counter

629
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,000
this d8505

630
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,159
attacks from a more realistic point of

631
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,919
view

632
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,640
the first injection of ta-505 comes from

633
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,039
spear-facing emails

634
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,840
so now let's look at how to detect these

635
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,720
malicious emails where security

636
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,559
solutions must be applied to block

637
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,880
malicious emails in advance

638
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,799
in addition since the effect is

639
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,640
different for each blocking method

640
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
the blocking rate is increased by

641
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,840
overlapping application of various

642
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,240
techniques

643
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,039
verification such as rbl and ip

644
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:31,919
address-based

645
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,440
email authentication technology and spf

646
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,679
and ip sharing list for sending spam

647
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,480
mail should be performed

648
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,799
for a more effective response security

649
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,279
technologies such as

650
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:47,520
dkim which is an email authentication

651
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,640
technology

652
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,679
that utilize a public key structure

653
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,000
and a domain based email authentication

654
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,400
protocol

655
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,600
dmarc should be additionally applied

656
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,520
in addition it is necessary to block

657
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,520
spam message through pattern inspection

658
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,919
and reputation inquiry

659
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,720
for emails that have passed the spam

660
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,960
email blocking it is determined whether

661
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,559
it is malicious through a version

662
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,360
detection

663
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,799
of the authentic bar or dynamic analysis

664
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:17,279
technique

665
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,760
of a link included in the email in a

666
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,720
sandbox environment

667
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,960
in the network separation environment

668
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,720
when external mail is viewed

669
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,200
in the internal business network the

670
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,679
threat can be eliminated by converting

671
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,840
the mail into an image format and

672
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,120
delivering it to

673
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,880
the business network the most important

674
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,559
thing is to improve the security

675
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,600
awareness among

676
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,039
executives and employees regular

677
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,200
training of responding to imprisonment

678
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
accidents can improve the security

679
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,000
awareness

680
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,679
and responding ability for employees

681
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,600
in addition it is necessary to

682
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,320
understand the attack flow of ta-505

683
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,240
circuit to minimize damage

684
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,240
and to prevent damage by quickly

685
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,159
