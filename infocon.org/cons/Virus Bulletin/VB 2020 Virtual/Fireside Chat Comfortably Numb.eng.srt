00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,639
hi and welcome to our fireside chat

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:03,919
comfortably numb

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,080
we'd like to ask you have we become

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,359
comfortably numb

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,280
in today's world of continued and

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,360
escalating threat sophistication

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,920
overload of information overwhelming

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,519
signs of complacency and lack of

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,800
diversity in both thought

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,119
and practice have we just become numb to

11
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,080
it all

12
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,640
our panel using the song titles of the

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,000
rock band queen

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,480
will dive into these aspects overload

15
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,560
too much data

16
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,560
oversaturation of messaging overstated

17
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,119
claims

18
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,920
threat sophistication and another day

19
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,680
another vulnerability another day

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,800
another breach

21
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,840
is this our wake-up call and by the way

22
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,520
who doesn't look to queen song titles

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,040
when you're trying to frame a cyber

24
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,079

with you ladies

57
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,399
all right so let's kick off this

58
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,040
conversation um as we mentioned

59
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,720
we're going to be using the song titles

60
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,560
from from queen music

61
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,159
and we'll kick it off with one of the

62
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,399
most relevant topics which is i'm going

63
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,840
slightly mad

64
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,079
um and basically to think about that

65
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,159
it's complacency at its finest

66
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,600
when the average person is being

67
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,360
inundated with information from all

68
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,959
sides whether it's media

69
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,040
it's their security teams it's it

70
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,000
support

71
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,239
um even their own credit card companies

72
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,160
are giving them information about how to

73
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,640
how to stay safe in the cyber security

74
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,520
world

75
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,040
to a point where it feels like nothing

76
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,800
matters anymore it's going to happen to

77
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,400
me anyway right

78
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,800
and then another song from queen i want

79
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,920
to break free

80
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,239
so after we talk about all of this this

81
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,319
going slightly mad how do we break free

82
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,840
from all of this and how do we get away

83
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,920
from that mindset that it's just another

84
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,480
day

85
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,000
another vulnerability yeah kathy i don't

86
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,200
know about you ladies that

87
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,680
i am going slightly mad right we're

88
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,000
living in challenging times i mean the

89
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,879
global coveted pandemics driven a rapid

90
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,720
shift for much of the planet to be

91
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,680
working

92
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,640
and going to school from home the shift

93
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,519
has brought an

94
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,920
unprecedented opportunity for cyber

95
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,959
criminals

96
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,680
to exploit vulnerabilities and human

97
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,640
weaknesses

98
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,680
and exploiting us they are between the

99
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,560
pandemic

100
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,239
you know a major u.s election campaign

101
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,560
an escalation of really long simmering

102
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,360
debates around

103
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,800
race digital lures and phishing emails

104
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,959
have practically written themselves and

105
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,959
not a day goes by that we don't hear

106
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,519
about a new breach or attack

107
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,400
technology everywhere is everywhere and

108
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,680
the result of bad

109
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,480
security is hugely impactful it's no

110
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,400
secret that the cyber criminals collect

111
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,360
intelligence

112
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,120
prepare their attacks and adapt to

113
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,040
changes in real time

114
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,720
the industry needs to be working

115
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,959
together we have to do a better job in

116
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,799
walking or talk about protecting

117
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,400
the ecosystem overall and never has

118
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,560
the need been greater for cyber security

119
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,560
leaders to join forces to mitigate the

120
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,040
threat

121
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,000
of the cyber activity that's being posed

122
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,239
to citizens corporations and governments

123
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,080
around the world today

124
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
and and then when you add to all to all

125
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,239
that that just overwhelming amount of

126
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,159
information we're inundated with every

127
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,519
day security alerts

128
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,760
articles notifications vulnerabilities

129
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,560
patches

130
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,480
it's coming at us from many many

131
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,599
different directions

132
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,238
it can be easily overwhelming and how do

133
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,680
you know what to focus on

134
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,320
how do you know what to prioritize um

135
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,120
it's simply

136
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,199
making one go slightly mad just trying

137
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,320
to keep on top of it all

138
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,680
yes it's uh yeah you're absolutely right

139
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,000
um and i kind of want to point out here

140
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,520
that you know

141
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,919
information security and cyber security

142
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,040
even though

143
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,280
a lot of it largely happens online in

144
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,639
the cyber world

145
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,040
so much of it is very human um there are

146
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,120
people at the end of our smartphones end

147
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,280
of our our laptops and of our you know

148
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,040
whatever computers even our smart cars

149
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,840
smart homes

150
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,199
but it's fundamentally human and

151
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,040
everything that's going on right now

152
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,080
um makes humans fear for their safety

153
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,919
fear for their health be worried about

154
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,360
their future um

155
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,960
you know there's there's a lot of

156
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
uncertainty going on right now

157
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,360
um and adversaries are hijacking that

158
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,960
they're preying on that fear that

159
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,080
uncertainty

160
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,880
and you know adapting to you know these

161
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,160
these new opportunities

162
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,360
so i think you know i've said before

163
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
having empathy for the user right and i

164
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,639
think that that's something that that

165
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,360
people have

166
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,680
have recently especially kind of come

167
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,479
come to the front

168
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,520
and said you know infosec we have to be

169
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,199
better about having empathy to the end

170
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,199
user having empathy to people who aren't

171
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,320
inundated

172
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,000
with the sort of cyber threats all the

173
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,240
time who don't necessarily have

174
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,120
you know the same understanding as we do

175
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,400
but i also kind of want to point out

176
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,039
here that

177
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,320
you know we also have to have empathy

178
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
for our colleagues and for the community

179
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,360
and approach and and hopefully be able

180
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,440
to better solve these problems

181
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,759
by understanding that infra information

182
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,680
security and cyber security is very

183
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,840
fundamentally human and that you know

184
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,440
the adversaries are human and the people

185
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,440
who are working in the space are human

186
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
and and by approaching it with empathy

187
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,199
kind of with creativity and

188
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,960
understanding the challenges

189
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,560
not just from a cyber perspective but

190
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,240
from global

191
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,880
social economic perspective as well i

192
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,600
think is is

193
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,240
is is very important and could and can

194
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,000
you know help us move forward

195
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,120
through this challenging time

196
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,560
yeah and and just to focus on the one

197
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,960
aspect of it it's 20 20 right so what

198
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,280
could possibly go wrong

199
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,880
this is something that i hear from lots

200
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,120
of people um all the time

201
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,440
and this year has certainly seen its

202
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,479
share of craziness

203
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,880
from just being locked down all over the

204
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,720
world everybody's had their own

205
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,400
flavor of what it meant to be locked

206
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,800
down this changing statistics that we

207
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,560
hear on a regular basis as to what's

208
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,400
happening with the pandemic

209
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,080
what's happening with the protest those

210
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,000
types of things around our country

211
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,520
and then so many more people are working

212
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,919
from home and and going to school

213
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,240
um from home as well so the time is

214
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,000
right for our adversaries to make their

215
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,560
move

216
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,680
and they certainly are doing that um

217
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,360
cyber security vendors have had to kick

218
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,880
into action to shift

219
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,720
with corporate security for many of

220
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,960
their customers to much larger pools of

221
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,639
those workers working from home as well

222
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,319
as these school districts that weren't

223
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:10,960
even

224
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,039
in a million years prepared to take an

225
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,800
entire school district and put them all

226
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,960
online at one time

227
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,720
and with school starting right now and

228
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,000
us working from home

229
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,599
we're having to take on new roles and

230
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,280
we're having to do different things

231
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,360
within our or within our corporations

232
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,360
our organizations as well as at home

233
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,120
if we've got kids sitting next to us at

234
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,639
the desk because they can't figure out

235
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,400
how to get into that zoom meeting

236
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,800
or they can't figure out how to log into

237
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,720
blackboard or one of those others so

238
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,360
yeah it is

239
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,919
it is a lot it is maddening for all of

240
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,400
us

241
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,720
and i have to admit that through all of

242
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,800
this i've been extremely impressed

243
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,440
with how these companies have been able

244
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,000
to

245
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,879
um have been able to stand up to this

246
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,520
challenge

247
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,879
and i think we're being pretty

248
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,120
successful at addressing these

249
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,000
challenges

250
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,759
it's over six months that we've been in

251
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,000
this pandemic and so many people have

252
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,599
stepped into those new rules that i

253
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,639
mentioned

254
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,800
and it's not time for us to relax just

255
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,240
because we're working from home all the

256
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,199
time this is

257
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,199
a i mean i may wear my pajamas to work

258
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,639
most days but

259
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,560
it's not time for me to to forget that

260
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,919
those adversaries are out there and

261
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,120
they're still trying to figure out how

262
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,360
to infiltrate our systems

263
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,160
so one of the things that we need to

264
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,599
keep in our forefront

265
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,240
is from an individual vendor perspective

266
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,800
is

267
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,639
is doing what's right for our customers

268
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,840
across the globe

269
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,080
as well as building and using the trust

270
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,159
relationships that we've already built

271
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,240
so that we can continue to share

272
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,200
collaborate

273
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
and cooperate so that we can help each

274
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,399
other through this

275
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,640
pandemic and that we can we can come out

276
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,880
of this on the other side more resilient

277
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,920
i appreciate that you brought up the

278
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,959
school item

279
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,040
because i know in the news lately

280
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,480
there's been some

281
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,519
uh reporting of uh students

282
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,760
uh eliciting cyber attacks or or

283
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,880
disruptions on their

284
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,640
schooling environment um and i would

285
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,480
like to think that this is just building

286
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,399
a generation of kids who are going to be

287
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,000
very very valuable infosec

288
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,480
professionals in the cybersecurity realm

289
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,680
um in the future

290
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,519
so although they might be you know

291
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,959
having some challenging times right now

292
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,120
i hope that ultimately it proves

293
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,040
positive that they can use their skills

294
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,200
um you know for good stuff in the future

295
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,480
so um

296
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,800
so yeah uh trying to keep a positive

297
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,399
note here right

298
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,040
um so so kind of going back to some of

299
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,320
these queenslands that we talked about

300
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,360
the invisible man

301
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,519
is a theme you know that we had talked

302
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,120
about you know prepping for this this

303
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,160
discussion but

304
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
you know this idea of from the days of

305
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,839
you know like the anonymous hacktivist

306
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,040
collective

307
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,959
um to you know today's more crafty

308
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,720
sophisticated you have your apt

309
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,839
actors um you have a lot more

310
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,160
sort of criminal and entities and

311
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,880
enterprise

312
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,240
enterprises um how do we even begin to

313
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,640
really

314
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
look at our enemies and the adversaries

315
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,920
today um

316
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,560
so to kind of posit you know we should

317
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,920
you know kind of discuss today's threat

318
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,160
landscape and how the adversaries are

319
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,720
are in many ways you know continuing to

320
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,040
to outsmart the collective good

321
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,440
um and i think you know one thing that's

322
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,279
interesting to me personally is that

323
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,600
you know adversaries are always changing

324
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,640
um they

325
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,399
while they might you know have sort of

326
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,000
the similar behaviors and the similar

327
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,560
you know

328
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,440
ttps right um that that enabled sort of

329
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,600
defenders to hunt them and to identify

330
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,079
them and to

331
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,399
defend against them um oftentimes you

332
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,120
know the message will shift based off of

333
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,360
um you know what what's going on and and

334
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,800
current events for instance we we

335
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,160
discussed you know how

336
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,680
you know fishing lures can be used for

337
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,279
covid they can be used for the election

338
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,120
right these sort of current events are

339
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,279
guiding adversaries in many ways

340
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,200
um and one thing that interests me

341
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,480
personally is

342
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,560
ransomware adversaries i feel like you

343
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,959
know we have 800 different kinds of

344
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,800
of corporate targeting ransomware these

345
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,320
days and it's not just

346
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,880
encrypting you know networks anymore

347
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,600
it's

348
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,760
you know the adversaries are adopting to

349
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,880
the fact that

350
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
corporations have learned okay let's

351
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,560
keep offline backups let's have you know

352
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,320
incident response plans in place so

353
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,760
when we do get ransomware we can

354
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
effectively remediate this and

355
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,920
respond without having to pay the ransom

356
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,360
well the adversaries are now

357
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,000
incorporating

358
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,519
the sort of data theft and extortion

359
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,880
piece of this as well where it's like

360
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,440
okay

361
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,600
you know the they've learned to defend

362
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,360
against us so let's add this new piece

363
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,480
that makes it a little bit

364
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,000
you know potentially more difficult it's

365
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,279
like all right well we didn't get to the

366
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,880
full encryption piece but

367
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,440
you know we still have this this this uh

368
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,959
thing that we can hold hostage whole

369
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,800
random and make some payment

370
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,120
there so um and finally you know the the

371
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,640
the sort of adversaries right like um

372
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,079
that are targeting ics industrial

373
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,240
control systems um this is something

374
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,800
that is is relatively new for talking

375
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,000
sort of cyber crime

376
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,639
cyber threat scale um is that you know

377
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,320
adversaries are being able to sort of

378
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,440
adopt ics

379
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,120
specific mechanisms where they can

380
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,800
create malware to target those systems

381
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,000
that are very critical

382
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,920
uh critical systems like electric oil

383
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,839
and gas manufacturing these entities

384
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:02,320
that

385
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,600
you know have these industrial

386
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,279
operations that aren't necessary your

387
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,120
phones and laptops but these other sort

388
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,360
of

389
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,880
interconnected interconnected devices so

390
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,040
you know we give names to these

391
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,880
invisible adversaries right everyone's

392
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,800
name is different the bears and the

393
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,279
apts and the you know the pandas and

394
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,320
everything the kittens

395
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,440
um but um but but yeah

396
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,959
how how do we kind of keep track of

397
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,320
these and how can we sort of stay one

398
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,519
step ahead of

399
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,040
you know these adversaries or the sort

400
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,560
of invisible uh

401
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,518
men or women

402
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,560
yeah selena those excellent points all

403
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,079
you know the invisible man

404
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,079
the hacker the bad actor the adversary

405
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,519
whatever you want to call it

406
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,360
they often seem to have the upper hand

407
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,839
right and we often make it easy for them

408
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,079
we are building and releasing software

409
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,519
with vulnerabilities

410
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,600
this is really hard to stay ahead of the

411
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,279
vulnerability pageant game

412
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,560
in fact i was keeping an informal track

413
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,040
list of the number of vulnerabilities

414
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,760
that have been

415
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,240
patched this year and as of september

416
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,240
just one

417
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,240
vendor alone has released nearly a

418
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,600
thousand um

419
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,000
patches for vulnerabilities and that

420
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,800
number

421
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,279
doesn't include all the vendors by any

422
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,000
means

423
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,040
so the overwhelming uh volume of patches

424
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,839
being released

425
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,399
is just extremely high and this is not

426
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,480
sustainable for any company large or

427
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,320
small to keep their heads above

428
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,560
um and we still have three months of

429
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,279
2020 to go i mean 2020 has just been a

430
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:29,760
bad

431
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,279
year all around so the invisible man

432
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,320
does have it easy

433
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,880
um it doesn't take much for an adversary

434
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,160
to outsmart us

435
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,639
finding uh vulnerability to exploit is

436
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,199
not difficult because we can't

437
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,040
nearly patch all those vulnerabilities

438
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,399
in time

439
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,320
and i do want to point out that i do

440
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,160
know that software vendors

441
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,240
are not building vulnerabilities into

442
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,320
their programs purposely

443
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,240
you know product managers and developers

444
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,760
they have good ideas and

445
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,000
and but sometimes they have roadmap

446
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,600
timelines they have to meet so

447
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,880
consequently

448
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,199
software gets released with unchecked

449
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,399
vulnerabilities

450
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,560
and there's just simply a growing over

451
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,600
emphasis

452
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,079
on external bug reward programs where we

453
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,079
pay experts

454
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,320
to find holes in software after it's

455
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,839
released to the public

456
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,240
as opposed to investing in the staff and

457
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,120
the resources

458
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,199
to limit that release of buggy software

459
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,399
to begin with

460
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,880
so i propose the latter right let's turn

461
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,760
this around

462
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,839
and invest in staff and resources to

463
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,279
ensure that software being released

464
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:31,920
today

465
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,360
isn't buggy to begin with janette i

466
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,320
agree with you

467
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,639
on your points here it is time that we

468
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,560
invest in staffing and resources to

469
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,000
tackle the ever growing threat of the

470
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,120
invisible man

471
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
our adversaries being part of one of the

472
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,959
leading analyst groups in cyber security

473
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:47,600
today

474
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,360
i see firsthand the amount of activity

475
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,199
that is going on behind closed doors

476
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,639
from our adversaries

477
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,720
as they discover new ways to infiltrate

478
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
businesses and individuals

479
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,480
our researchers uncover and report on

480
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
the tactics being used the verticals

481
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,440
being targeted

482
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,199
and share this data with the vendors who

483
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,959
can roll out protections for all of our

484
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,959
customers across the globe

485
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,360
in 2020 we continue to see evolution on

486
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,839
the ransomware business model

487
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,320
with data exfiltration and extortion

488
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,079
increasing concerns even for

489
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,720
organizations with high quality backups

490
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,360
business email compromise scams continue

491
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,880
to rake in millions if not

492
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,120
billions from fraud conducted against

493
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,279
small and medium-sized businesses

494
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,279
the more things change the more they

495
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,320
stay the same

496
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,680
and this is something that we need to

497
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,519
keep having conversations about and keep

498
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,800
working towards

499
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,639
together yeah so it's true kathy so true

500
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,079
let's skew to a new uh queen song

501
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,360
title hammer to fall um you know the

502
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,680
perception is privacy is now lost

503
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,920
the assumption that corporations have

504
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,600
already had all their information

505
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,920
out there data is already freely

506
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,720
available

507
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,399
so don't bother reading that privacy

508
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,160
policy or work harder to protect

509
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,800
yourself

510
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,000
what are your thoughts on that as the

511
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,600
average person just waits for that

512
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,519
hammer to fall jeanette

513
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,040
for their data to be part of one of

514
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,959
these large corporation breaches

515
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,279
we as cyber security professionals need

516
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,079
to work harder to change that perception

517
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,240
with time technology collaboration and

518
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,560
cooperation we can begin to tackle this

519
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
mindset across the ecosys

520
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,560
system education to me starting as young

521
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,399
as will actually listen to us

522
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,399
will help us start and help us to

523
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,079
strengthen the collective good in cyber

524
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,120
security

525
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,880
i've run some workshops for young girl

526
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,040
scouts uh palo alto networks has a

527
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,480
partnership with the girl scouts of the

528
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,560
usa and i was lucky enough to be part of

529
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,120
the

530
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,480
the group of people who helped to

531
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,399
develop those badges

532
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,079
and i've done some workshops for these

533
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,240
girls and it's it's amazing to me

534
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,639
how little young people think about the

535
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,399
technology and the internet of things

536
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,079
that they're surrounded by

537
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,720
on a regular basis they have had this

538
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,839
this generation

539
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,519
they've never known a world without all

540
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,680
of this technology so to them it's just

541
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,559
normal

542
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,199
and to even have one of these kids think

543
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,160
about

544
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,760
how many computers did you come in

545
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,359
contact with on your drive

546
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,439
over here today starting from when you

547
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,640
got up this morning

548
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
everything in your house all the way to

549
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,160
when you got over here today to do this

550
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,959
workshop

551
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,880
and they don't think about things as

552
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,319
computers and as

553
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,119
risks um even from just using you know

554
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,119
oh mom and dad set that up for me so i

555
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,559
don't have to worry about it well how

556
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,640
much does mom and dad know about setting

557
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,480
up that particular device

558
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,760
um so without the ability to

559
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,360
um to uh it doesn't occur to them how

560
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,120
many computers they come into contact

561
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,679
with

562
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,080
and therefore it's it's just a different

563
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,000
world than what we grew up in

564
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,840
and i think that education and starting

565
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,520
young and and thinking about those

566
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,720
threats

567
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,280
as we as we raise these kids and and

568
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
teach them in schools

569
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,720
is one of the ways that we can start

570
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,240
tackling this

571
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,160
i love that the girl scouts now have a

572
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,600
cyber security badge

573
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,960
the the little patches uh it's so cute i

574
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,760
love it

575
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,440
um so it's so i i took to kind of go

576
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:11,760
back

577
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,840
you know to the the hammer to fall piece

578
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,880
right like we're just kind of

579
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,960
waiting for it um i i do think there's a

580
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,559
sort of collective acceptance that's

581
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,280
like okay well

582
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,520
i'm gonna get hacked eventually there's

583
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,039
you know there's nothing we can do about

584
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:23,360
it

585
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
um my data is out there whatever i am

586
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,880
100 guilty of this

587
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,360
as well by the way i'm not you know i i

588
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,200
have i think probably said those exact

589
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,160
words before

590
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,000
but like i wonder how much of that is is

591
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,280
this sort of sort of in

592
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,200
circle of infosec professionals or you

593
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,960
know like folks on twitter people at you

594
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,160
know these conferences kind of having

595
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,919
these same conversations versus you know

596
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,039
what's kind of going on in the real

597
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:43,520
world

598
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,080
right so i i do think people genuinely

599
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,679
care about this stuff because

600
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,440
but there but there are organizations

601
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,520
that we put our trust into

602
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,600
um to safeguard our information and

603
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,799
they're the ones that are getting

604
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,240
breached right they're they're the ones

605
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,280
that are

606
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,520
having these sort of missteps and and

607
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,360
you know having our data exposed

608
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,679
so i think you know it's it's it's

609
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,640
important

610
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,000
to have individuals be aware of this

611
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,440
have them like you're saying start from

612
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
a very early age and be like these are

613
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,880
all of the things that i'm touching that

614
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,559
are collecting my data this is all of

615
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,240
the information that i'm giving to

616
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,880
various services but i think the flip

617
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,919
side of it is

618
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,240
we also need to hold corporations and

619
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,440
these other organizations that are

620
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,559
collecting our data hold them

621
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,679
accountable for that

622
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,600
um i think gdpr for instance the global

623
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
data protection regulations that were um

624
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
uh implemented in europe is a good first

625
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,720
start right so

626
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,480
so having these rules and these laws

627
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,000
that say you know this is how you have

628
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,880
to safeguard your data these are the the

629
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,320
the protections that you must have in

630
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,240
place um implementing

631
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,600
major fines for breaking those

632
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,440
regulations um i think even

633
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,080
earlier today or yesterday oregon um

634
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,480
implemented some very stringent

635
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,160
artificial intelligence facial

636
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,360
recognition law is sort of preventing

637
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,360
you know abuse of this type of

638
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,679
technology so i think that

639
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,840
you know there's there's the folks

640
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,280
coming up having a better understanding

641
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,360
of this but the existing technologies

642
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,000
and and

643
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,960
you know they have to sort of be you

644
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,280
know

645
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,919
safeguarded and and we can be sort of

646
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,799
you know

647
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,480
activists in the community to say you

648
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,720
know like here's what we think

649
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,240
the corporations or the governments or

650
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,240
whatever should be doing to protect us

651
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,679
and and being you know advocates for um

652
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,520
more restrictive guidelines for

653
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,760
protecting our data for ensuring that

654
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,720
you know

655
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,880
these organizations are held accountable

656
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,120
for for you know the breaches or the

657
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,679
hacks

658
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,400
and selena along that same line and and

659
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:38,799
you know

660
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,640
pointing out another song a wonderful

661
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,559
song from from queen

662
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,200
a kind of magic when we think about that

663
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,720
it's not magic right

664
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,880
we have the skills we have the ability

665
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,000
to work together

666
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,039
collectively to tackle this problem

667
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,280
and thinking about the magic that people

668
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,280
think it would actually entail

669
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,799
what are the right skills what's the

670
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,400
diversity that we need to bring

671
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,559
into our organizations in order to help

672
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,520
solve these problems

673
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,200
let's let's move the conversation a

674
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,960
little bit more to what is it

675
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,320
what are some of the driving forces

676
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,000
behind cyber security

677
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,559
and the people who collaborate and bring

678
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,080
everyone to the table

679
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,640
and and accelerate us forward faster

680
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,480
than us fighting alone

681
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,000
what are some of the more creative ways

682
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,600
we can start thinking about problem

683
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,320
solving

684
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,240
and where are those who can assist us

685
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,480
best so this is something that

686
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,480
um i've spent a lot of time talking

687
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,520
about

688
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,280
because my background isn't necessarily

689
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,880
cyber security i've had a lot of

690
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,320
different things in my life that i've

691
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,799
done

692
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,120
i'm an emt on the side i do search and

693
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,919
rescue

694
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,760
i've done software development worked

695
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,200
for a lot of the government agencies

696
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,799
throughout my career

697
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,280
so i think about that diversity that we

698
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,240
need to bring

699
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,039
into our our environments to help us

700
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,360
solve these really difficult problems

701
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,000
um i've had the opportunity as i

702
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,200
mentioned before that

703
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,799
of working with young people not only

704
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,320
with the girl scouts but also at

705
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:00,799
different

706
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,840
uh school job fairs and things like that

707
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,919
and it's always interesting to me that

708
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,280
when you ask kids

709
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,720
you've got your cyber security on your

710
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,080
table over there and the kids can come

711
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,880
talk to you

712
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,159
kids don't want to come talk to you

713
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,320
about cyber security you're not the

714
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,240
sexiest person there you know it's not

715
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,720
that

716
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,400
it's not the most exciting career that

717
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,760
they can think of so they don't

718
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,039
generally want to come over to your

719
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:21,760
table

720
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,159
but the ones who do come over and i ask

721
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:24,880
them about it

722
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,640
you know i i point them in the direction

723
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,159
of well what is it that you really do

724
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,679
want to be and if somebody says they

725
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:30,960
want to be a nurse

726
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,720
bring that conversation back around

727
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,559
there isn't a hospital in the world that

728
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,640
doesn't use technology in order to do

729
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,440
their work

730
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,720
and what happens when they are

731
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,400
infiltrated or they're attacked or

732
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,840
ransomware

733
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,760
and they don't have access to their data

734
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,280
anymore or

735
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,360
kids always oh i want to be a pilot or i

736
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,200
want to be something really exciting

737
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,720
well have you ever looked at the

738
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,400
dashboard of an

739
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,320
airplane um to see what kind of

740
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,840
technology is up there and

741
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,440
you think about infiltration of those

742
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,600
types of systems that's one way that

743
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,880
i've been able to have better

744
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,559
conversations i think with these young

745
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,200
people

746
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,960
trying to get them to understand that no

747
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,640
matter what you do throughout your life

748
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,000
going forward from today

749
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,320
on technology is going to be there and

750
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
cyber security is a real threat

751
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,120
for any technology so the magic that

752
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,799
we're talking about is bringing all of

753
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,320
those different types of

754
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,880
people the diversity of all these people

755
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,240
into one place

756
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,159
and getting ideas from everybody to help

757
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,440
us solve those problems

758
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,039
yeah great points kathy for sure you

759
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,320
know when i think of

760
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,280
a kind of magic as it pertains to cyber

761
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,240
security

762
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,159
i go right to what the cyber threat

763
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,919
alliance is doing you know we're getting

764
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,600
the industry to work together for the

765
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,559
greater good

766
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,200
cta has built up this trusted community

767
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,279
to facilitate not just

768
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,840
daily sharing a threat intelligence but

769
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,000
a trusted platform where topics and hot

770
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,799
topics

771
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,559
where hot topics and like critical

772
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,480
threat information and details

773
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
can really be discussed in a loyal

774
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,720
environment

775
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,240
when cyber industry collaborates when we

776
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,480
can better put together the complete

777
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,240
story of the adversary and their

778
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,320
activity and their ttps

779
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,840
then we can be better able to respond

780
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,799
appropriately

781
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,679
and timely and and shift that power so

782
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,919
the industry has the upper hand

783
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,760
you know everyone has a piece to the

784
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,760
puzzle and once you put that

785
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,279
back together then you can see that

786
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,520
overall picture

787
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,440
you know in the industry our

788
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,360
competitiveness

789
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,440
should be on our technologies not on the

790
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,840
intelligence and all our work around

791
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,240
disruption disrupting adversaries

792
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,360
should be a collaborative exercise we

793
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,799
should be better

794
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,720
as an industry overall working together

795
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,919
on this

796
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,080
i did want to touch on diversity as well

797
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,400
you know when we look at creating a

798
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,200
diverse workforce where you bring fresh

799
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,840
and

800
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,400
you know unique ideas to the table and

801
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,240
and really give folks the chance to

802
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,120
express those

803
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,240
ideas and that they're listened to i

804
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,120
believe then

805
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,880
that we can move the needle you know we

806
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,320
have to approach

807
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,279
solutions with fresh mindsets because

808
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,720
what we're doing isn't

809
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,919
always working right and i propose we do

810
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,240
a better job of walking that talk of

811
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,159
hiring a diverse workforce

812
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,039
and when i say diversity i think of it

813
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:23,760
as

814
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,240
obviously racial diversity that cultural

815
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,200
backgrounds

816
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,159
you know age gender social economic

817
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,120
status

818
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,760
history education and and even

819
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,640
disabilities

820
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,440
you know we're simply not hiring enough

821
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,200
folks with disabilities in the cyber

822
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,000
industry

823
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,159
we need to be better and when you get

824
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,200
real people

825
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,520
with real world environments providing

826
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,200
input you're going to create and build

827
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,000
programs

828
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,240
and applications that truly impact

829
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,000
society as a whole

830
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,880
you really get to uh get that out of the

831
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,880
box thinking it's going to help us

832
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,080
make notable differences there's no

833
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,520
downside to inclusion it's all

834
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,240
positiveness for sure

835
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,960
yeah definitely um i think you know

836
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,559
having diversity on your team

837
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,240
just your threat intelligence team for

838
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,159
example just reads better threat

839
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,360
children's products

840
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,919
um you know having creativity coming at

841
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,520
things differently having a different

842
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,360
mindset and understanding is really

843
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,559
really valuable

844
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,440
from an intelligence perspective um i do

845
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,799
kind of want to point out here

846
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,440
that you know we are a panel of white

847
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,159
women

848
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,760
um and which is awesome this is a

849
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,200
terrific step forward right like you

850
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,760
probably

851
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,679
at least i wouldn't have seen that you

852
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,200
know when i was covering conferences

853
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,600
as a journalist like years ago um it's

854
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,520
like the the all male panel hashtag all

855
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,159
male panel

856
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,520
so it's great right that it's an

857
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,360
all-female panel this is awesome

858
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,000
um but i i do really want to point out

859
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,080
here the diversity efforts in general

860
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,440
um that have been undertaken by the

861
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,360
technology industry the cyber security

862
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,159
industry

863
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,480
largely focus on enabling and empowering

864
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,520
white women

865
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
um while sort of leaving other

866
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,200
minorities people with disabilities like

867
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,159
you mentioned

868
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,000
um just out of the conversation um

869
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,039
and i think that that's something that

870
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,039
you know we have to acknowledge um i

871
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,200
and and acknowledging my privilege as

872
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,640
someone in the industry and

873
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,799
trying to do my the best that i can to

874
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,480
say you know bring in more people

875
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,640
to say that the value of of people's

876
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,480
different backgrounds race genders

877
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,640
sexual orientations is super important

878
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,559
and selfishly it would make my team

879
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,679
better it would bring better

880
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,960
intelligence right

881
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,360
so i think that you know we've we

882
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,440
continue to improve i think but i

883
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,039
definitely think that there's a lot more

884
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,360
that we can do and um i do want to kind

885
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,440
of just give a shout out i think that um

886
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,159
the uh the there has been some really

887
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,200
great conversations going on with

888
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
hashtag share the mic in cyber

889
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,880
um this has been an effort a total

890
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,720
grassroots effort um

891
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,360
that uh has has really been able to sort

892
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,279
of empower people in the cyber security

893
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:51,840
space

894
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,120
um that uh lauren and camille um i feel

895
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,399
bad that i am

896
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,960
forgetting their last names um but

897
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,760
lauren

898
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,320
over at the high harvard cyber um

899
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,559
organization and then camilla who is a

900
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,320
uh and very involved in the natsek

901
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,919
community um

902
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,200
of course i'm on the spot and forget our

903
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,679
last names but something uh that i think

904
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:12,880
is really cool and interesting is the

905
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,159
hashtag share the mike and cyber

906
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,440
campaign that is

907
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,039
you know having these conversations and

908
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,480
discussions and encouraging

909
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,720
uh uh diversity inclusion within the

910
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,120
industry

911
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,039
so we were all talking about this great

912
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,559
positivity so now we're gonna take a

913
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,240
pivot to something terrible

914
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,200
um sheer heart attack um this is a fun

915
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,760
one

916
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,960
uh so so of course it's a great map but

917
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,559
also staring your board of directors in

918
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,279
the face

919
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,720
as you explain how we were breached um

920
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,640
sort of this is your wake-up call this

921
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,919
is your sheer heart attack

922
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,960
something happened and go

923
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,240
how do we approach that how do we

924
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,480
address that uh uh curious you know to

925
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,559
your thoughts here

926
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,320
you know you talked earlier about

927
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,000
empathy and fishing and all and when

928
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,240
i look at like fishing emails today

929
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,600
they're very good

930
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,200
you know the adversaries have really

931
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,120
fine-tuned their approach and

932
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,080
it isn't difficult to see why people

933
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,360
fall for them

934
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,440
and bad actors nowadays are even calling

935
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,279
people up and telling them that they're

936
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,039
the police and that they have a warrant

937
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,799
for their arrests unless they pay this

938
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,760
money

939
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,840
it's not difficult to see how people get

940
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,360
scared and react

941
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,200
before stopping to really think about

942
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,360
the situation thoroughly

943
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,440
um and the colvin pandemic really

944
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,080
brought an extraordinary opportunity to

945
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,919
exploit human weaknesses with

946
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,080
fishing and some of these other lures

947
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,279
they're really well done

948
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,399
and people are falling for them you know

949
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,799
we have to honestly do a better job of

950
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,240
getting folks to recognize

951
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,840
what is phishing you know when they are

952
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,279
being scammed

953
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,279
um all these social engineering tactics

954
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,120
are good and we need to um

955
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,039
get people to think about what's

956
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,240
happening and question

957
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,880
if it's really valid or not and can you

958
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,520
imagine

959
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,000
gosh can you imagine if you're the one

960
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,039
that opened

961
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,120
a phishing email or did some sort of

962
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,159
mistake and

963
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,399
caused your company to be breached i

964
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,600
mean what a sheer

965
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,960
heart attack that would be yes

966
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,840
oh my gosh i can't even yeah that's a

967
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,960
that's a great point to

968
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,039
write like like education is so

969
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,799
important and making sure that people

970
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,320
are aware of the threats that are out

971
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,480
there um and i think that's a huge value

972
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:20,799
that

973
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,559
that that threat intelligence provides

974
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,080
um and that certainly the cta

975
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,000
organization provides as well is is

976
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,520
you know being aware of the adversaries

977
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,880
being armed with the knowledge

978
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,799
leveraging sort of threat intelligence

979
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,840
um to help guide um the cyber security

980
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,600
decisions within your organization

981
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,000
um helping to sort of further educate

982
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,640
you know the

983
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,039
the users and and hopefully you know

984
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,640
build up those building blocks to to

985
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,159
combat the threats and and

986
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,520
to be you know more prepared for these

987
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,200
type of activities

988
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,960
um i do kind of want to point out here

989
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,559
it's interesting because

990
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,720
there is a large organization that

991
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,320
experienced the sheer heart attack

992
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,799
and responded to it really interestingly

993
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,640
and and pretty impressively is

994
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,840
is norsk hydro so there's the aluminum

995
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,080
um

996
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,080
manufacturer that is based out of norway

997
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,279
and and they were the victim of the

998
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,320
locker google attack

999
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,519
goga attack last year um it had

1000
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,880
large disruptions to their operations it

1001
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,640
really sort of ground the company to a

1002
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,559
halt it came at a very trying time for

1003
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,559
the organization as the ceo

1004
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,320
um had recently left the company so it

1005
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,559
was it was a very tumultuous time

1006
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,960
and it sounds like you know every other

1007
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,399
story right a large

1008
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,960
corporation gets ransomware gets hacked

1009
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,679
and then

1010
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,200
you know they're thrown into tumult and

1011
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,720
then have to deal with it but an

1012
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,760
interesting way that

1013
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,519
norsk was able to sort of resolve that

1014
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,440
was being very transparent

1015
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,960
all throughout their incident response

1016
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,480
activities all throughout you know

1017
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,320
discussing what was going on

1018
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,720
um bringing the manufacturing operations

1019
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,559
back online bringing their it up back

1020
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,279
online

1021
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,279
um the spokespeople for the company were

1022
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,880
being very open with it right like the

1023
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,159
executives were saying this is what

1024
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,080
happened here's how we dealt with it

1025
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,440
and being able to do that is not only

1026
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,880
looks good for the company but it also

1027
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,640
provides the industry as a whole

1028
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,480
with a sort of a road map like here's

1029
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,000
how this company did it and here's how

1030
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,760
maybe we could do it moving forward

1031
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,120
so i think that's really really

1032
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,480
interesting lessons learned from that

1033
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,880
perspective

1034
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,960
and that's a really good example um and

1035
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,080
and i agree with you

1036
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,559
that if if people and corporations can

1037
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,880
be more transparent when things happen

1038
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,640
i mean one of the biggest risks to our

1039
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,960
corporations is still the people right

1040
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,880
i come from a background where i work

1041
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,399
for the federal government for a long

1042
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,159
time in classified environments and we

1043
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,200
know our biggest

1044
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,519
our biggest adversary was the internal

1045
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,840
people that we worked with right there's

1046
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,320
um there's always that threat so being

1047
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,399
transparent and being able to

1048
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,519
accept that people do make mistakes and

1049
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,760
we all will make a mistake at some point

1050
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,200
and hopefully we're not the ones that

1051
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,960
are going to be the ones that has to

1052
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,559
you know go to our board of directors or

1053
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,960
to the ceo of our company and say well

1054
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,679
i accidentally clicked on such and such

1055
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:56,720
and

1056
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,799
you know but there are lots of lessons

1057
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,480
to be learned and and the more that we

1058
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,600
learn about this and

1059
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,120
and the more that we educate our

1060
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,279
employees and and still continue as

1061
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,880
selena as you as you brought up that

1062
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,440
empathy

1063
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,200
showing that empathy for those that we

1064
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,279
work with and those that we work for

1065
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,279
um i think that we'll we'll show a lot

1066
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,880
of success as we move

1067
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,919
uh greater as we move into um you know

1068
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,760
the next phase of technology and

1069
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,399
the next phase of cyber security

1070
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,120
well ladies um let's tackle one more

1071
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,399
queen song and

1072
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,880
as we wrap up here um i think the most

1073
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,039
appropriate one is the show must go on

1074
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,640
right we must continue uh to advance our

1075
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,679
sophistication

1076
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,080
and belly up against those cyber

1077
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,120
adversaries

1078
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,640
you know what advancements on the good

1079
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
guys side do we see coming

1080
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,760
that gives us that leg up um where do we

1081
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,320
see

1082
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,640
us going from here and and what does the

1083
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,000
security landscape look

1084
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,559
like in a year from now what can we

1085
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,360
count on

1086
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,919
um and where do we need to be heading to

1087
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,880
stay fresh and in control

1088
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,760
i'll go ahead and start you know yes the

1089
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,200
show must go on right the

1090
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,039
internet is an integral part of our

1091
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,960
lives and as kathy you mentioned

1092
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,079
you know computers are literally

1093
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,599
everywhere we're surrounded by

1094
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,679
technology and data

1095
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,399
but we do need to fix some things right

1096
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,199
um

1097
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,440
first i hope that we stop accepting

1098
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,239
status quo

1099
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,359
and move from being comfortably numb to

1100
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:23,760
getting

1101
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,639
uncomfortable you know i prefer to have

1102
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,079
a program

1103
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,239
an operating system you know a new

1104
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,839
application released

1105
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,079
without any vulnerabilities than having

1106
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,918
software vendors adding new features

1107
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,800
as their priority you know let's stop

1108
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,320
releasing buggy software and spend the

1109
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,839
time it takes to test and validate

1110
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,760
before release

1111
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,918
this is going to give the good guys a

1112
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,440
leg up honestly

1113
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,079
and when i think about what does the

1114
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,760
threat landscape look like a year from

1115
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,639
now

1116
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,239
well more and more insecure

1117
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,040
connected devices are going to come to

1118
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,240
market right and

1119
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,160
and more and more internet of things

1120
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,760
devices um

1121
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,760
brings more uh uh security issues right

1122
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,320
i saw one note yesterday that there are

1123
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,359
50 billion connected devices today

1124
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,640
50 billion we need to ensure

1125
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,839
that security first is the mindset

1126
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,079
and we need to ask ourselves too does

1127
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,240
everything really have to be connected

1128
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,000
and on the internet do we really need to

1129
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,640
be con collecting all that information

1130
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,079
and have access to everything all the

1131
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:30,880
time

1132
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,760
frankly i don't think we do um so let's

1133
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,280
take care of that foundation first you

1134
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,440
know security and privacy has to be the

1135
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,400
priority

1136
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,720
i believe the cyber security industry

1137
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,520
knows that

1138
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,839
it's just not an easy problem to solve

1139
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,880
totally right of having a very building

1140
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,520
on a secure foundation makes everything

1141
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,359
built on top of it more secure more

1142
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,280
robust and better

1143
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,040
um so i think that's that's that's

1144
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,640
really good and your point about maybe

1145
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,160
not everything has to be connected to

1146
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,040
the internet i

1147
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,200
i think that would be great i hopefully

1148
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,960
it would be cool in the future if a

1149
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,320
future prediction that i would like to

1150
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,480
come true is is maybe kind of pumping

1151
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,760
the brakes a little bit on having

1152
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,520
everything be digitized and

1153
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,720
and kind of you know embracing analog

1154
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,040
again we'll see if that actually happens

1155
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,320
but who knows

1156
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,400
um to your point about you know what

1157
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,800
will move us forward uh kind of the show

1158
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,680
must go on

1159
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,520
you know this is this whole conference

1160
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,800
is about intelligence threat

1161
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,160
intelligence and and certainly with

1162
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,400
cta's information sharing and

1163
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,800
making sure that a robust community is

1164
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,760
is made aware

1165
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,560
of threats and collaborating and working

1166
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,839
together to make the

1167
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,480
world better safer stronger etc um so i

1168
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,359
think that's a trend that we're

1169
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,720
definitely going to see continue and i

1170
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,440
think that's

1171
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,560
we're talking about you know having

1172
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,000
security as a foundation i think

1173
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,760
collaboration as a foundation is also

1174
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,040
something that is should be really

1175
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,000
important

1176
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,680
you know being able to sort of tackle

1177
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,440
problems with creative ideas

1178
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,920
i'm really preventing gatekeeping in the

1179
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,760
industry right welcoming everyone

1180
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,160
making sure that diversity and inclusion

1181
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,599
is really fundamental

1182
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,359
um practicing empathy we've mentioned it

1183
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,119
a few times that's so big

1184
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,960
for users for collaborators for

1185
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,640
colleagues etc

1186
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,240
and then leveraging knowledge and skills

1187
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,839
from a lot of different industries and

1188
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,000
not just security and computer science

1189
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,839
right kathy you mentioned that you're an

1190
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,520
emt as a background i'm a journalist

1191
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,119
that's that's my background right we've

1192
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,880
done many things worn many hats and here

1193
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,480
we are at security bringing our unique

1194
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,520
perspectives and

1195
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,000
and creative problem solving to to the

1196
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,040
space so

1197
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,800
you know i i think that that is going to

1198
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,720
be really important and hopefully the

1199
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,800
industry will be very welcoming to

1200
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,040
to to those different sort of ideas and

1201
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,760
creative problem solving

1202
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,000
and i can't agree with you both more i

1203
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,920
mean you've hit on every topic that i

1204
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,440
probably was going to mention here to

1205
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:43,839
wrap

1206
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,480
up my part um but one of the things that

1207
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,000
i wanted to reiterate and

1208
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,200
and something that i talked about a

1209
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,359
couple of times during this conversation

1210
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,400
today is the need for education and the

1211
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,440
need for

1212
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,280
more people to be comfortable with

1213
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,839
educating others about cyber security

1214
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,200
i know one of the biggest problems that

1215
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,520
we ran into from the girl scout badge

1216
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,839
perspective is that the leaders aren't

1217
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,599
cyber security professionals so they

1218
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,200
don't feel like they're qualified to

1219
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,800
teach cyber security to their girl

1220
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,920
scouts but that

1221
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,079
couldn't be farther from the truth as

1222
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,520
you read through the materials and you

1223
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,119
educate yourself and you learn more and

1224
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:17,520
more

1225
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,960
you already know a lot about cyber

1226
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,960
security because you are all

1227
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,760
the ones who are accessing um technology

1228
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,520
on a daily basis

1229
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,040
so i i i can't agree with you guys more

1230
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,040
on what we need to do to move forward

1231
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,599
the diversity of thought the bringing

1232
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,200
everyone to the table to help us solve

1233
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,400
these problems

1234
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,880
and working together collaboratively

1235
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,640
with our trusted partners with other

1236
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,839
organizations

1237
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,720
so that we can look to our future and

1238
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,160
hopefully start squashing these

1239
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,040
adversaries

1240
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,440
as they're getting smarter and smarter

1241
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,960
and and looking for new ways to

1242
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,720
infiltrate our systems

1243
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,760
um we can certainly start tackling those

1244
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,560
problems

1245
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,000
and then we also need to start looking

1246
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,599
at how we tackle the human

1247
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,400
the human problems behind those cyber

1248
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,440
security attacks and

1249
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,440
and how we we fix it going forward

1250
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,000
yeah absolutely well kathy and celine i

1251
