00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,280
hi our topic in this presentation is the

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,440
evolution of ransomware in latin america

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,240
but first

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,840
let us introduce ourselves i am fernando

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,840
acosta

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,000
right now i'm the head of the situm

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,400
sword i have been in cyber security for

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,119
a while

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,920
my specializations are oriented on to

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,680
the investigation

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,800
and response of incidents as a hobby i

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,279
like

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,160
like breaking on the weekends to enjoy

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,119
the nature

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,519
that it's near the city i live in

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,800
hi my name is melda i'm the head of the

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,200
cyber intelligence unit at sea labs i

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,719
have been in the business for more than

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,320
10 years i

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,039
in my free time i love learning about

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,520
human behavior and i consider myself

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,719
myself a foodie

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,399
before the agenda let us let us tell you

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,520
why we select this topic before the q3

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,559
of 2019

26
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,719
the impact of ransomware in latin was

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,680
important

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,840
but the number of victims with a big

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,720
impact

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,159
was low but after the this quarter

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,840
i mean the third quarter of 2019

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,560
we saw quite a few victims that started

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,439
to report

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,159
a deep impact in their operation and in

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,080
the loss of information

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,640
at the same time we have seen that most

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,240
of the victims

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,640
have a no reference of the impact of the

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,799
rent of the ransomware and sometimes an

40
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,360
obsolete way to approach the response

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,280
for example many of them didn't believe

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,560
they could have excited data and didn't

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:40,880
have

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
a backup to recover their active

45
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,000
directory

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,479
so this is why we would like to show you

47
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,640
what we have seen in the battlefield

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,360
when a victim and us approach a

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,880
ransomware attack

50
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,960
and let us show you the agenda

51
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,280
basically what we want to tell you about

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,640
is a

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,439
a timeline of the attacks in the region

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,399
how the ransomware is behaving where the

55
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,479
ttps that we are observing

56
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,560
and we are also going to tell you about

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,200
the challenges that we are experiencing

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,200
and some recommendations from the field

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,280
it is important for us to come clean and

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,360
let you know that this is our vision

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,120
everything that you will see in the

62
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,560
presentation is based

63
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,480
solely in our telemetry we complement it

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,560
with some information coming from our

65
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,920
cyber ecosystem

66
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,559
and also from coming from open sources

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,879
let's go directly to the timeline

68
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,280
what is important to know is that all

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,519
events in the timeline and were high

70
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,000
profile

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,239
victims and in all cases critical

72
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,720
information was encrypted and sometimes

73
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,280
installing prior encryption as we can

74
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,000
see before the q4 of 2018

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,640
the important events were sporadic also

76
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,680
we can see that after q3 of 2018

77
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,319
there was a renewed preference to also

78
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,280
look to government infrastructure

79
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,680
we can see also that some occurrences

80
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
happen as if they came in

81
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,040
wipes at the same time

82
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,519
in latin america we are observing more

83
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,400
rivals that

84
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,440
we did observe it in the past and mr de

85
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,560
for example which is not really popular

86
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,319
ransomware around the

87
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,799
world it's becoming really really

88
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:33,680
popular in

89
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,560
in mexico or it was really popular in

90
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,280
the q

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,360
a q4 of 2019 for example

92
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,760
cases like double paper and maze and

93
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,440
they focus only

94
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,159
in government victims in the region

95
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,560
while they focus on different sectors

96
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,840
around they were in

97
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,200
specifically some cases like medusa

98
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,239
locker and

99
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,599
rival had been observed having

100
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,920
a having a pattern really interesting

101
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,120
one and for example

102
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,599
they attack a financial company and a

103
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,120
manufacturing sector

104
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,159
exactly at the same time using exactly

105
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,280
the same sample

106
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,079
so a

107
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,399
medusa locker and also ribbon

108
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,680
are runs on and work in ransomware as a

109
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,040
service model

110
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,880
so it is believed that the attacker

111
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,320
behind in

112
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,360
behind those attacks should be

113
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,680
avoiding spending more money in new

114
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,120
samples so it

115
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,960
uses the same one at the same time with

116
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,560
two different companies from different

117
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,360
sectors so

118
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,960
in that way it is likely

119
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,479
that nobody is going to detect that and

120
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,440
it they won't share indicators of

121
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,400
compromise

122
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,759
or things like that

123
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,960
so what is new really about the

124
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,638
the ransomware uh

125
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,680
in the cases that we have observed um

126
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,479
first of all

127
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,320
in some cases where run somewhere as a

128
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,080
service is employed

129
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,120
is it looks as the if the ransom base

130
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,600
payment is not the main objective maybe

131
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,400
it could be

132
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,720
exploration or information or it could

133
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,520
be just

134
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,560
the way to erase their tracks

135
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,560
however the the cyber actors are not

136
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,440
really seeing

137
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,680
any monetization of the ransomware

138
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,320
attacks for example a king's government

139
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,080
so if government doesn't pay it means in

140
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,800
that

141
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,680
they should they must have another

142
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,360
another motivation

143
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,560
to execute those attacks because

144
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,880
across latin america no one of the

145
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,600
countries

146
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,639
a has been known

147
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,680
for paying in ransomware when

148
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,479
it attacks a government institution

149
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,479
something that we also see is that

150
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,520
tax and legal information

151
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,720
was a target during the attacks for

152
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,360
example

153
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,720
in some cases the severe actors

154
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,960
is steal this information prior to

155
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,919
encryption

156
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,560
and in other cases they only encrypt

157
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,639
that information

158
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,120
that must be because for many companies

159
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,360
it is really difficult to justify to

160
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,479
the azure a irs or a

161
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,280
similar organization in their country

162
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,479
that they don't have

163
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,600
how to prove a they

164
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,800
spend money and they start they can

165
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,000
start having trouble with taxes so it is

166
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,639
believed

167
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,080
that the attackers already noticed

168
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,039
that it is a the kind of information

169
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,440
that

170
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,840
the companies really care about so

171
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,160
that's why they are focusing on this one

172
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,720
more we are also seeing that the

173
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,880
persistent of the

174
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,240
of the malware is a stronger than

175
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,120
it was in the past uh for example

176
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,520
corresponding to an incident the victims

177
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,199
need to take additional steps to

178
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,720
eradicate intrusion

179
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,759
and to verify it

180
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,360
so as incident response what does that

181
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,160
mean

182
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,560
about the finance and tax on legal

183
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,039
information

184
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,840
what this means for us is that big teams

185
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,560
should have

186
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,720
an incident response roadmap that

187
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,800
integrates some financial and legal

188
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,080
advice advisor

189
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,840
and in our site as i.t and security team

190
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,720
we must have a specialized way to manage

191
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
and detect

192
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,440
of what is being exported to internet

193
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,000
because

194
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,639
if this is an infiltration we and we can

195
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,520
prevent it

196
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,800
we could prevent sometimes uh some

197
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,840
action some random actions be because

198
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,319
they usually happen after this

199
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,120
filtration

200
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,879
so if we respond on the acceleration

201
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,280
we can still we can also prevent the

202
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,840
ransom

203
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,319
but when talking about the pandemic how

204
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,440
really

205
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,319
change runs somewhere during this time

206
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:12,800
what

207
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,840
we can say about that we observe it is

208
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,280
that

209
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,000
of the whole universe of attacks and

210
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,680
most of them were related

211
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,080
to fishing and fruit during the pandemic

212
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,440
especially

213
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,800
fishing that was trying to get financial

214
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,759
information

215
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,320
and personal information and the

216
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,279
ransomware was

217
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,200
still there but was not the primary kind

218
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,919
of attack

219
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,760
that we observed so it wasn't a train

220
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,399
it wasn't happening all the time however

221
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,920
fishing and fraud was

222
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,200
a constant a kind of attack that we

223
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,880
observed in

224
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,839
all of the organizations

225
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,680
talking about the number of attacks

226
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,279
related to the healthcare

227
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,959
system a while in many places

228
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,000
like u.s and uk

229
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,480
some health care organizations whether

230
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,240
it were suffering from

231
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,040
ransomware attacks that that is

232
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,680
something that

233
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,959
didn't occur in in the region in

234
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,440
not in mexico and on another in non

235
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,720
other countries

236
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,839
were known for having issues related to

237
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,040
attacks against

238
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,240
health care organizations so this can be

239
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,440
related that in latin america there are

240
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,160
no

241
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,440
strong laws against a

242
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,120
the the inform the stolen

243
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,160
information know that a confidential

244
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,680
information related to

245
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,279
healthcare patients becomes

246
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,600
public like it is a in the u.s and

247
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,720
it is in other countries in europe for

248
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,760
example

249
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,279
we also see that a

250
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,640
with this ransomware and

251
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,079
depend during the pandemic the cases

252
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,399
that accurate

253
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,079
in the case of the the response was

254
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,360
slower because during the incidents

255
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,800
many of the victims even have a an ideal

256
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,600
solution

257
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,760
because it is difficult for many

258
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,839
organizations still to get it

259
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,200
in in the region so

260
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,320
if you want to try to respond fast

261
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,200
into an event during this time it

262
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,920
becomes

263
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,640
really complex because you depend of the

264
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,600
availability of the sysadmin and the

265
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,720
a and the avail availability of the

266
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,720
possible victim and you also

267
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,079
depend of how a

268
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,839
how tech save is the end user

269
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,399
to provide you some information so it

270
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,279
becomes difficult and slower to respond

271
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,399
during

272
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,399
during an incident in general during the

273
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,959
pandemic

274
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,240
we also observed that in many cases a

275
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,320
in the ransomware families that were

276
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,519
attacking in the region

277
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,560
used rdp vulnerable rtp

278
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,079
and vulnerable smb services to get into

279
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,680
the organization

280
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,200
and the number of rdp and smb and many

281
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,320
other ports

282
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,519
open happen because the i

283
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,880
the idea people decided that it is

284
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,640
better to expose an rtp

285
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,760
and make sure their business people is

286
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,959
working properly from home instead of

287
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,279
taking care of the security and having

288
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,360
trouble during the execution of their

289
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,399
regular services

290
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,079
so about ttps let's talk first

291
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,880
about the initial access we have seen a

292
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,120
lot of threat intelligence that points

293
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,240
the initial access to fishing but even

294
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,560
though

295
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,200
we have found evidence about this we

296
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,320
have seen that

297
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,880
many victims also have exposed services

298
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,120
that are being support exploited

299
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,560
during the ransom attack and they

300
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,560
were having access to it we have seen

301
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,160
uh that phishing attacks is a metal that

302
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,639
is

303
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,519
easy to blame and everybody can fall to

304
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,040
an official attack

305
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,680
but it's not easy to demonstrate the

306
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,040
exact fishing email

307
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,519
that was successful in the in the attack

308
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,320
on the exposed services we have seen uh

309
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,399
the connections we have seen

310
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,480
the fields access and not only on rdp

311
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,519
we also have seen that we have found

312
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,920
smb services that even the client

313
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,120
doesn't know

314
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,639
why they they have these services posted

315
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,000
because they shouldn't and it's not only

316
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,880
about

317
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,880
being aware or being unaware of

318
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,680
of the service they they are exposing

319
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,000
but

320
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,360
it's about that they firmly believe that

321
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,320
they don't have

322
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,560
any of these services possible to the

323
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,360
internet

324
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,079
it's about having a wrong perspective

325
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:20,560
about

326
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,720
what they are really sharing to internet

327
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,079
and that's kinda

328
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,359
square discovery

329
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,000
and also what we have seen and this is

330
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,279
quite interesting we have seen uh some

331
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,800
kind of behavior

332
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,959
when the threat uh it's

333
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,920
it has uh it's really quiet with the

334
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,360
threat that

335
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,800
has a some intrusion and it tries to end

336
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,240
on a ransom

337
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,279
and the the threat is really quiet and

338
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,639
they try to work

339
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,600
with just with leaving of the land tools

340
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,160
until

341
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,399
until they start the ransom and then

342
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,680
they get noisy

343
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,240
but the beings they live before is quite

344
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,480
soft

345
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,120
some of the living of the land tools

346
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,760
that the

347
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,480
uh tend to use are for executing

348
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,600
scripting

349
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,959
are for elevating privileges and in this

350
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,120
case like rock don't they are using for

351
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,399
dumping passwords

352
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,519
of users that are already logged on the

353
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,720
on the endpoints but in contrast

354
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
in contrast we have seen a lot of

355
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,399
streets that

356
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,279
were they where they use a huge number

357
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,720
of tools

358
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,160
even some tools that look redundant

359
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,040
between between them they generate a lot

360
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,440
of noise and this causes a lot

361
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,720
uh the logs to rotate quite often and so

362
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,360
it's hard to get evidence of what

363
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,839
happened

364
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,639
several days before because the uh

365
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,920
events are rotated

366
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,560
and stuff like that but i must clarify

367
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:02,959
that

368
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,720
not all the tools that they download are

369
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,480
malware or hacking tools

370
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,920
they are also downloading an other kind

371
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,279
of tools

372
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,320
and here we can see some uh some of the

373
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,360
tools they download

374
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,920
some of them like bluehound are to map

375
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,760
the active directory tree

376
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,600
some of them are to have lateral

377
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,240
movement in between the endpoints and

378
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,199
some of them they have additional

379
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,000
actions

380
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,880
for example aircraft is used to

381
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,399
refiltrate information

382
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,279
in cloud storage solutions but it's not

383
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,320
a hacking tool

384
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,279
it's not an admin tool it's just a tool

385
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,240
to share

386
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,600
information to close storage solutions

387
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,279
and we must clarify that they also use

388
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,240
living of the land tools

389
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,279
on the encryption actions that we have

390
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:57,839
seen

391
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,959
and when we were looking for uh some

392
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,000
evidence what we have uh found out

393
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,199
is that it's always a good idea to look

394
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,480
for evidence on with those folders

395
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,880
because signs the malware tend to to

396
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,040
keep this folder on touch

397
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,079
the attacker tends to blow their scripts

398
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:18,959
and artifacts

399
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,880
on it so it so it's always a good idea

400
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,120
to look for files that have less than

401
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,040
three weeks in this folder

402
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,120
just remember that when you are looking

403
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,480
for these files

404
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,720
you may be getting good noise about

405
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,440
windows update files and stuff like that

406
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,839
and it's also a good idea to look for

407
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:38,880
new folders that

408
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,639
are on the c on the root of the c drive

409
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,399
and what what what what we have

410
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,720
been seeing on the distribution and the

411
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,600
triggering

412
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,480
is that we have found that they are they

413
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,839
use

414
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,120
basically two ways they have two ways to

415
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,639
spread the malware the first one is to

416
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,559
run a scheduled task that tries to run

417
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,599
all the the ransom all on

418
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,319
all the machines at the same time this

419
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:10,720
way

420
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,679
is really really fast but not always hit

421
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,000
or

422
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,160
the mark on all the machines but because

423
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,599
some machines

424
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,000
could be unaccessible or didn't wrote

425
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,640
the script

426
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,679
in a right way but uh

427
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,160
the other way they use is to add the

428
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,480
script on the group policy actions

429
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,320
we have found that this method even

430
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,559
though it does

431
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,000
infect them the machines in a slower way

432
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,160
if you want to stop the spread of the

433
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,679
infections you have to follow

434
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,080
specific steps to avoid hitting the

435
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,400
group the group policy action

436
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,720
and this means a slower way to recover

437
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,640
so who is who in ransomware for

438
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,000
what we have seen over the time is that

439
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,360
many families

440
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,200
are really specialized hi they have

441
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,120
really sophisticated a designers

442
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,880
behind but what is also observed that

443
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,240
most of them or all of them use leaving

444
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,440
of the land

445
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,640
tools and techniques but also we can see

446
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,760
that they tend to exfiltrate

447
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,480
most of them tend to eggs with right

448
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,600
information

449
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,600
prior to the encryption and i mean

450
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,120
for most of them i refer to the ones

451
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,000
that work in

452
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,919
ransomware as a service model because in

453
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,200
the case of rule

454
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,240
on double payment they don't handle

455
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,919
a ransomware as a service model and they

456
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,960
also a steal information prior

457
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,440
encrypting we have observed that

458
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,559
specifically

459
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,400
with a double double payment

460
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,280
and in for example the payment is one of

461
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,000
a

462
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,240
the ones that most care about tax and

463
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,679
legal information that we

464
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,720
talked before we also observe

465
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,000
when comparing these families uh that

466
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,240
a almost all of them in try to use gpo

467
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,080
to distribute

468
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,120
the ransomware through the network

469
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,480
so also it is

470
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,520
observed that in some cases

471
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,080
they affect all sectors and the only one

472
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
that focuses on one sector

473
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,799
is a snake

474
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,559
so here we would like to share you

475
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,520
charge you some

476
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,559
uh common ideas uh that could help you

477
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,360
to avoid some basic mistakes

478
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,880
and we have divided on what is a good

479
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,160
idea and what were

480
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,440
the mistakes that we have seen sometimes

481
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:55,840
on the

482
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,360
incident response so

483
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,479
what's a good idea

484
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,400
a good idea is to focus on the solution

485
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,320
for example

486
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,440
but what's a bad idea the bad idea is to

487
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,159
follow a

488
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,280
blank game we have found that some idea

489
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,559
administration that

490
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,600
lose lose focus on the incident uh

491
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,080
response course and sometimes even

492
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,840
before they start fixing the problem

493
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,080
they want to prove they they did

494
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,520
everything right

495
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,720
or or that someone did a mistake

496
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,120
and that's it's a bad idea because uh

497
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,159
the first

498
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,159
uh moments of an intrusion or

499
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,200
on on this kind of incidents

500
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,200
is crucial and sometimes they

501
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,559
the team loses the most precious menus

502
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,120
and

503
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,440
sometimes ours that should be used

504
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,159
understanding

505
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,240
how the ransom was triggered and how to

506
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,960
contain the spread of the attack

507
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,039
in something that is worthless

508
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,880
so what's a good idea

509
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,360
a good idea for example is verify the

510
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,400
backups before

511
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,919
getting back online again

512
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,880
so what's a bad idea a bad idea is to

513
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,799
restore from backups that are already

514
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,240
compromised

515
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,200
so what happens here is that sometimes

516
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,120
when the when a victim is in a ransom

517
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,840
attack

518
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,159
he has a big hurry to fix everything

519
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,440
that uh

520
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,000
at the fastest possible way but

521
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,039
sometimes the victim

522
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,600
ignored that some intrusions have been

523
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,159
inside

524
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,159
the network for more than two or three

525
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,760
weeks sometimes they

526
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,039
are in the network for several months so

527
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,200
it's pretty important that after

528
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,000
you restore a backup of our an any

529
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,880
endpoint

530
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,000
um verify the please verify if the

531
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,200
endpoint doesn't have

532
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,960
any indications that is that it could be

533
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,159
it that if to verify

534
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,600
if it still compromises

535
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,159
so what's a good idea a good idea

536
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,000
is quickly check if the domain

537
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
controller has gps that could be

538
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,880
disregarding the run somewhere

539
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,840
so what's a bad idea a bad idea could be

540
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,600
to follow a processor to verify if the

541
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,799
system is compromised

542
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,080
but at doing so you're still uh

543
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,559
you are triggering the gps that will

544
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,159
encrypt it

545
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,120
what we have seen here is that uh

546
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,919
sometimes

547
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,840
uh the victim uh wants to know

548
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,000
what's the level of the damage and they

549
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,600
try to verify how many

550
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,600
endpoints are encrypted but

551
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,559
if you're not verifying how the gpos are

552
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,200
triggering

553
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,880
uh uh the evidence of

554
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,080
of encrypting maybe

555
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,919
by logging in the endpoints you are

556
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,440
triggering the encryption

557
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,520
so it's really really important to

558
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,600
understand gpos and the distributing and

559
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,320
the trigger

560
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,679
triggering the ransomware before you

561
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,880
start to act and you start to verify

562
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,480
how much you are infected

563
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,840
so what's a good idea

564
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,880
a good idea is collecting evidence or

565
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,120
may i back up before reinstalling a

566
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,480
compromise system for example so what's

567
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,919
a bad idea

568
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,159
the bad idea is that if you are in a

569
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,919
hurry lose evidence or

570
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,679
information still recover when

571
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,000
restarting a compromise system

572
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,720
what we have seen here is that sometimes

573
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,200
the

574
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,000
victim is in a really hurry to get

575
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,840
everything online

576
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,360
and getting everything running again

577
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,360
and when doing so it's important that

578
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,760
if the asset of what's a key factor of

579
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,640
the intrusion

580
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,360
or if it's used to have important

581
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,559
information

582
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,440
or if it was an asset that it was

583
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,080
important

584
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,360
in the operation it is

585
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,640
pretty it's necessary and is

586
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,840
a good idea to consider consider

587
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,159
making a backup at least of the critical

588
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,120
evidence before

589
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,760
installing maybe you you won't back up

590
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,279
everything but you will

591
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,520
need to back up some evidence about this

592
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,880
and this will help you maybe uh

593
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,559
to because you can verify if prior

594
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,919
events uh relate to the new ones and

595
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,600
you it will also help you to to know

596
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,320
what was the level to show what was the

597
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,279
level of

598
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,320
the compromise

599
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,640
data and stuff like that that could help

600
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,520
you uh

601
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,720
in a retrospective analysis

602
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,279
and there's always as much chance that

603
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,080
if you

604
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,440
uh do a full backup there's always a

605
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,640
small chance that

606
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,960
uh the ransomware private key could get

607
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,960
public sometime in the future

608
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,679
maybe now it's a really really small

609
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:02,159
chance

610
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,400
of happening but still it could be

611
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,520
useful someday

612
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,799
so what are the challenges that we are

613
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,240
facing on latam

614
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,440
the first uh challenge that we

615
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,080
face a lot is the lack of invasive

616
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,120
telemetry

617
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,158
many organizations receive iocs and

618
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,120
attack tendencies that are are

619
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,640
produced by telemetry from vendors that

620
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,279
don't have a huge conversion on the

621
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,720
latam ratio

622
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,600
and this information is basic because

623
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,080
it's not

624
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,960
based in the vendor visibility it is

625
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,320
based on the

626
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,120
on the vendor facility only so the

627
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,960
organizations believe that

628
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,320
if the vendor reports that the security

629
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,200
the security incidents only occurred in

630
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,240
europe

631
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,799
it means that only europe is being

632
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,360
attacked

633
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,400
while in reality the same time of attack

634
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,880
could be happening in different parts of

635
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,440
the

636
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,080
world including latime but it's just

637
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,960
that the vendor

638
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,200
didn't have the visibility in this

639
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,559
continent

640
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,360
another challenge that we have faces is

641
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,559
the

642
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,679
isolated iocs and what we mean

643
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,200
is that we have found many threat

644
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,720
intelligent sources

645
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,279
that share a lot of iocs without any

646
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,159
context

647
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,200
for example you can find a source with

648
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,640
a lot of hashes of an apt campaign

649
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,039
but this source never tells you these

650
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,880
hashes are for downloaders

651
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,200
these hashes are for keyloggers these

652
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,039
hashes are for command and control

653
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,159
uh etc so they don't

654
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,480
even tell you which mp5 hash

655
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,760
uh correspond to the same file of

656
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,880
which sha hash so

657
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,240
that keeps saying handler guessing of or

658
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,520
investigating

659
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,000
what the the the threat intelligence uh

660
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,200
really really fun uh to be clear

661
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,400
a lot of information is great for

662
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,840
detection if you have a lot of

663
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,400
information that's great for detection

664
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,399
but if you don't have any context

665
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,559
when you are responding on an incident

666
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,720
there will be a lot of duplicated work

667
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,960
and a lot of precious time lost

668
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,159
just in the investigation so many

669
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,120
information

670
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,520
won't be that useful it will be useful

671
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,480
but it won't be

672
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,159
that useful that as as useful as it

673
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,080
could be

674
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,320
another uh challenge that we have

675
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,840
that this relation have uh faces is a

676
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,880
different maturity in a victim when an

677
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,080
organization has

678
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,120
an infrastructure in different countries

679
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,440
in

680
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,679
is really complex to that they follow

681
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,159
the same security and it rules

682
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,720
because the cultural uh changes that

683
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,840
they have

684
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,960
and sometimes they they are several

685
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,320
companies of the

686
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,200
of a parent company so this translates

687
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,840
to different maturity in each region or

688
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,679
in each company

689
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,520
and a low level of visibility

690
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,679
between them that makes company

691
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,520
vulnerable to more attack types or

692
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,960
techniques because maybe

693
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,640
uh one company is vulnerable

694
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,240
of something and other company is

695
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,200
have another service exposes that it

696
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,080
shouldn't

697
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,240
and so there are more open

698
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,679
oh more holes where it could be

699
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,360
exploited

700
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,159
and it's less and the company is less

701
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,440
ready to respond

702
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,080
because they don't know what the other

703
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,279
one

704
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,440
the problems that the other company of

705
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,080
the other region has

706
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,600
and another challenge that we have faced

707
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,279
is the comparison between av and edr

708
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,679
we have found that many it people are

709
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,840
still comparing

710
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,240
uh the antivirus with an easier

711
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,679
on incident response we think that this

712
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,960
is kind far from this is quite far from

713
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,440
to

714
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,080
from true because when you are

715
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,799
responding an

716
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,520
incident you must have context

717
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,600
information of what happened before and

718
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,159
after something is detected

719
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,799
you must have get additional information

720
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:37,200
of

721
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,760
what is the state and the behavior of a

722
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,600
machine in a specific moment

723
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,399
and you must get uh which end point

724
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,640
having the same behavior than on more

725
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,159
than others and also when detecting an

726
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:50,799
intrusion

727
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,159
not everything is malware

728
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,679
so this is something where the

729
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,559
where the antivirus solutions tend to

730
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:00,960
fall

731
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,720
short and it's important to

732
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,399
to to understand the difference uh that

733
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,919
the organizations understand the

734
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,320
difference between antivirus and adrs

735
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,360
and another another challenge that we

736
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,080
have

737
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,480
found is the excessive trust in complex

738
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,840
passwords what we have seen is that a

739
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,320
lot of

740
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,360
a lot of people get shocked when

741
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,760
attackers know that their password that

742
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,000
they get shocked because they found the

743
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,200
attacker

744
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,520
got their passwords because it was

745
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,720
really

746
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,840
complex how it happened but as

747
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,840
it people we must understand that the

748
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,000
password complexity only helps

749
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,320
for some kind of attacks for some brute

750
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,200
forces for

751
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,760
some directional attacks dictionary

752
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,880
attacks so

753
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,240
sorry but there are many other ways to

754
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:58,559
get

755
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,919
uh the password or to bypass the need

756
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,279
of a password so the to have complex

757
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,519
passwords is good but

758
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,559
it's not enough

759
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,080
and also we have a big challenge in the

760
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,799
region

761
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,279
because they believe that ransomware is

762
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:19,840
coming

763
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,559
it is coming in some way but they are

764
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,200
not

765
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,240
really a world they don't believe the

766
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,120
ransomware is actually actually here

767
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,760
because

768
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,279
a latin america has a record of

769
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,640
experiencing attacks at least two

770
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,679
weeks later they are

771
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,399
they are announced publicly so it is

772
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,399
important

773
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,200
to know or it is important and to

774
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,240
recommend

775
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,039
to a small or million organizations

776
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,080
especially

777
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,039
that they should have in place uh

778
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,080
ransomware

779
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,279
a backup plan or a

780
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,480
backup plan based of a on the

781
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,279
organization affected by ransomware for

782
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,159
example

783
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,760
however a what is for sure

784
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,840
is if a ransomware attack is no taking

785
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,039
seriously the company

786
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,559
can have issues and later not being able

787
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:19,279
to

788
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,960
provide anything else so the

789
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,799
this false belief is that a

790
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,360
it is not something that is going to

791
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,640
happen to me as an

792
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,519
organization well

793
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,279
the key here is timing and they are

794
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,919
every organization can be a target but

795
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,360
you know the attackers are

796
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,559
not really focusing a

797
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,760
in those kind of

798
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,679
victims so they will

799
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,960
have more interest in

800
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,919
attacking those ones that can represent

801
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,039
a financial

802
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,600
uh a financial institution and

803
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,960
manufacturing

804
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,720
a organization like we saw before but a

805
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,840
the case with travelex

806
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,880
makes everybody to evaluate

807
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,720
how a ransomware attack can have a

808
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,200
an impact over the organization that's

809
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,559
the case why

810
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,799
travel makes a just just

811
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,159
was declaring itself in monarchy so

812
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,039
and also we saw last year that a case

813
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:31,519
where

814
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,159
a company lay off more than 300 people

815
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,600
because it was picked in the federal

816
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,399
somewhere

817
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,080
and they were not able to pay

818
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,519
they know were able uh to recover from

819
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,399
the ransomware

820
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,600
even the after they paid for the

821
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,320
for the ransom and recovering the uh

822
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,679
recovering the kid

823
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,720
for the time they were a they

824
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,159
have the decryption key they already

825
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,519
have financial

826
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,240
a financial issues that they were not

827
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,360
able to overcome so ransomware

828
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,040
is not coming from what is here

829
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,760
so i'm talking about recommendations as

830
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,040
we have a as a community we have been

831
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,000
hitting over

832
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,119
over and over again that a the same

833
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,239
recommendations

834
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,839
but you know it's really interesting

835
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,079
when the attackers really validate that

836
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,000
those are with recommendations

837
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,320
uh this is a this is a screenshot of

838
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,839
a of the conversation between cwt

839
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,119
and that was a publishing many media

840
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,000
outlets

841
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,199
and it is really funny how in the

842
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,079
how the attacker tell the company that

843
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,079
it was a great pleasure to do business

844
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:50,399
but

845
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,440
also he says that he's going to provide

846
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,639
some recommendations

847
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,719
to avoid a company he happen for

848
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,880
something similar in the future so

849
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,599
but when you see their recommendations

850
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,000
you see

851
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,960
that they say that even in some cases a

852
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,640
map locker

853
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,880
can a can destroy the operation so

854
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,160
here we can see that following in the

855
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,839
best practices

856
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:20,000
pays off because those

857
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,440
because at least having a way

858
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,160
to protect information that is more more

859
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,640
valuable

860
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,960
the companies are going to be in a in a

861
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,000
better place and

862
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
if they have a good a

863
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,520
cyber security strategy and at least

864
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,359
basic security hygiene

865
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,880
it is likely that for the company won't

866
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,240
be a victim like a in the way that it

867
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,599
happened to see the realty

868
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,280
so what are what are organ

869
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,320
or recommendations first we want to

870
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,960
recommend

871
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,560
to use a multiple multi-factor

872
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,200
authentication and this is because one

873
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,400
of the first action

874
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,480
in an intrusion is the execution of the

875
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,760
passwords so

876
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,440
it's important to have an additional

877
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,960
control to

878
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,160
for accessing the operative system and

879
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,399
all this is all the services possible

880
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,880
especially if those services are on the

881
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,359
on the active directory but all the

882
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,520
services possible

883
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,920
another recommendation is to use offline

884
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,359
backups

885
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,720
there is still uh there are still itis

886
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,240
specialists who thinks that

887
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,640
remote availability storage could be a

888
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,520
backup

889
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,359
but a real backup should have

890
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,040
information offline

891
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,640
and a set of versions that were

892
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,760
that you could use to recover

893
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,839
in different states another

894
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,240
recommendation for the response is to

895
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,119
have a

896
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,760
good threat intelligence because in an

897
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,200
incident we need to have

898
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,599
actionable intelligence that could help

899
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,960
us to investigate

900
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,000
an act in a fast way and of course the

901
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
threat intelligence should be ttp

902
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,560
oriented

903
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,960
another recommendation is to use some

904
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,000
kind of drp solutions to try to detect

905
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,920
exfiltration

906
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,560
it's important to detect excitation

907
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,760
indicators because

908
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,079
many ransomware attacks do exit rate as

909
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,119
we saw

910
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,920
before and sometimes the situation does

911
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,960
more damage than the ransom itself

912
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,160
and it's not only uh using uh

913
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,200
it's not only about using drp solutions

914
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,400
it's only it's also need to have

915
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,599
it it's also the need to have a

916
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,160
wider technology for detections but for

917
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,680
because for example

918
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,400
there is the need to detect that

919
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,760
exfiltration

920
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,680
also with other solutions that could

921
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,200
verify stuff like

922
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,920
protocol tunneling or access to closed

923
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,720
storage as

924
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,839
as we saw with our clone and

925
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,320
yes also it's important to have

926
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,200
visibility

927
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,720
on the north south and the east west and

928
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,040
to block a traffic this kind of traffic

929
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,560
but it's also but we also

930
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,200
need to monitor uh the behavior of the

931
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,240
network

932
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,599
uh in the end points

933
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,960
and it's not only to have

934
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,320
the technology to offer is not the

935
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,040
only the need of of having a technology

936
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,079
to detect

937
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,880
but also to have that at the technology

938
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,240
for response

939
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,720
sometimes we have the idea that a sign

940
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,599
up for detection will help us to respond

941
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,240
but on an insulin response you need to

942
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,079
have more information

943
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,680
and also it's important

944
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,760
to have a way to investigate and

945
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,200
orchestrate actions

946
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,880
on different security and network

947
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,680
solutions and it's important to have

948
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,560
uh access to all the endpoints to act

949
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:10,800
and

950
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,240
investigate this kind of inclusions

951
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,520
and last but not least

952
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,000
we we always need a continuous

953
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,960
monitoring

954
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,520
it's so thin it sounds simple it sounds

955
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,520
reluctant but

956
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,359
it's not only about other critical

957
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,599
elements it's important to continually

958
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,520
aggregate context on the events

959
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,520
on alerts uh not only on security events

960
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:35,920
but

961
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,800
also on operational events that could

962
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,839
tell you

963
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,920
if they they if there is a change

964
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,880
in the behavior of the network or on the

965
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,520
users

966
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,560
or on the endpoints so

967
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,119
i hope these recommendations and this

968
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,960
point of view that we share

969
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,320
could be useful to you to you for uh

970
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,560
understand better the attacks of things

971
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,640
of the

972
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,680
ransom but also to understand the

973
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,319
evolution

974
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,319
and how to respond and how to act uh

975
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,720
in this kind of of problems and how to

976
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,800
be ready

977
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,520
thanks a lot

978
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,560
thanks guys
