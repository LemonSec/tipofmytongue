1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,880
hello and welcome to my talk like beast

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,840
to honeypot

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,920
a journey through honeypot deployments

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,160
so

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,359
i have prepared a little bit of

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,560
content for you basically um we'll start

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,199
with

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,320
some technicalities and then do some fun

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,039
stuff

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,199
in the end all rounded up by by a

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,960
conclusion so

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,320
maybe we should start by giving you some

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,399
context so about me

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,920
what i do for work is i work for vmray

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,760
as a labs infrastructure tooling and

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,600
automation developer

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,079
so basically i'm providing most of the

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,160
tools and automation for the labs team

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,719
so that they can work efficiently

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,760
what i do for fun is what you are

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,480
about to see today as well as ctfs and

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,480
photography so

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,239
basically this is what i do for fun so

24
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,479
please don't lay yell at my employer

25
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,799
yell at me instead

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,840
so maybe let's preface this a little bit

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,960
more

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,439
because it's a tale of things i've tried

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,840
and am trying so it's an ongoing process

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,520
that never really is is done

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,439
so i am no expert in any kind of way i'm

32
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,000
just

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,080
it's just a tale of things i've tried

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,479
and am trying

35
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,079
so if you see something that you

36
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,479
think i can do better please go ahead

37
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,759
and tell me

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,079
i would be very interested to learn from

39
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,240
you as well

40
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,600
so as this is a public talk

41
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,799
and honeypots are kind of a

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,000
one-shot customized thing i'm

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,960
trying to to show you what you can do

44
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,360
but

45
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,000
not how i did it in detail just to

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,640
preserve

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,840
my tweaks and customizations and try to

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,640
at least

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,600
have my honeypots undetectable or hard

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,840
to detect as long as possible

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,399
so this is also one of the main reasons

52
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,119
you'd

53
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,239
find comparatively less talks about this

54
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,120
topic because

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,760
people want to preserve their knowledge

56
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,560
and not

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,800
burn their customizations by telling the

58
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,239
world how they can detect the honeypots

59
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,560
again if you're interested in details

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,800
find me afterwards

61
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,040
find me on twitter or just message me or

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,760
mail me if you want to

63
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,879
so maybe we should start

64
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,000
with the intro of what a honeypot is so

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,239
a honeypot basically is a system

66
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,519
intended to mimic

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,800
likely targets of a cyber attack

68
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,840
what does that mean um so

69
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,160
honeypots basically

70
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,040
look like vulnerable systems and they

71
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,840
can

72
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,640
either emulate a server so something

73
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:58,959
like

74
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,400
ssh mongodb an iot device or even a mail

75
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,599
server

76
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,720
or they can emulate a client like

77
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,280
browser for finding drive-by downloads

78
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,319
or malicious javascripts

79
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,040
the most the majority of honeypots i

80
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,840
know of

81
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,280
are server honeypots so this is what you

82
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,720
what you tend to find outside

83
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,920
you can further group honeypots into

84
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,400
three distinctive groups which are low

85
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,440
medium and high interaction honeypots

86
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,400
low interaction honeypots are quite easy

87
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,280
to define

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,640
so these are basic scripts that present

89
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,280
a protocol conform login

90
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,080
and try to grab the credentials so if we

91
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,799
take ssh as an example

92
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,879
this could even be a simple script that

93
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,000
does nothing else

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,120
than presenting an ssh login and then

95
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,360
logging the credentials so the username

96
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,080
and the password that were entered

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,080
medium interaction honey pots are a bit

98
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,360
squishy to define

99
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,560
these are still scripts but they emulate

100
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,280
a full system without being one as an

101
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,040
example there is kaori

102
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,879
which is a medium interaction ssh

103
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,879
honeypot so

104
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,920
kaori emulates common commands and

105
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,040
even part of a file

106
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,720
system without running a full linux

107
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,280
kernel

108
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,560
somewhere this is

109
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,440
what high interaction honeypots do so

110
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,560
for example

111
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,400
docpod is running a full linux image

112
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,880
as uh as a docker image that is then

113
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,840
open to the world as a man in the middle

114
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,080
middle proxied connection that you can

115
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,520
connect to so every

116
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,080
command in every interaction with a real

117
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,960
linux system

118
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,560
is logged and the system is discarded

119
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,840
afterwards as soon as you close the

120
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,639
connection

121
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,560
so if we think of the three

122
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,440
main groups as kind of an inverse

123
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,720
pyramid

124
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,840
you can you can organize them like this

125
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,759
and what's interesting is the detail in

126
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,639
the inside

127
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,199
increase if you if you go from low to

128
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,039
high interaction honeypots

129
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,120
so you start with just grabbing

130
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,199
passwords and usernames and you end up

131
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:25,680
with

132
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,440
seeing exactly every command and

133
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,000
interaction with the system

134
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,919
but detail and insight aren't the only

135
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,440
things that grow

136
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,199
the error potential and the attack

137
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,800
surface are

138
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,080
also things that increase and

139
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,160
with that i mean the more complex the

140
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,720
system is the more chances for mistakes

141
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,600
there are especially in regards of

142
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,520
deploying and configuring the honeypot

143
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,280
right

144
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,160
and last but not least uh the hardware

145
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,400
demand and the complexity increase as

146
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,280
well as

147
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,400
um high interaction honeypots tend to be

148
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,759
quite computationally intensive

149
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,560
tasks as well as being quite the complex

150
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,120
systems

151
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,720
so up until this point you might ask

152
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,560
why should i do that then so

153
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,319
basically there are three main scenarios

154
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,800
that might be of interest so

155
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,080
you can use uh honeypots to find

156
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,759
attackers in your network so

157
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,960
basically use them as kind of a trap

158
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,199
as in you deploy them into your internal

159
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,000
network you

160
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,520
don't tell anyone that you did

161
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,360
and then you monitor for incoming

162
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,440
connections or pod scans

163
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,039
basically you can tell that as no one

164
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:45,440
knows

165
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,400
this is a system that exists no one

166
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,120
should be

167
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,919
connecting to it anyway so you can think

168
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:52,319
of

169
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,800
every or you can you can think of every

170
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,880
connection as being

171
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,479
potentially malicious and something you

172
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,720
should investigate as soon as possible

173
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,800
the second big use case of my of

174
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,759
honeypots is

175
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,960
getting general grasp of attacks as in

176
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,160
what is happening outside so looking at

177
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,880
the new

178
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,280
malware campaigns or the newest

179
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,080
credential stuffing attacks or even

180
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,360
the new exploits that are out there

181
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,880
especially the last over the last weeks

182
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,319
all major vendors got hit with

183
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,960
more or less bad

184
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,960
bad software flaws that they had to

185
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,520
patch and you can build honeypots for

186
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,560
this and

187
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,880
have a look at what people try to do

188
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,560
with them

189
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,360
and last but not least you can check for

190
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:47,840
open

191
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,879
directories and more payloads because

192
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,919
usually when malware is distributed it

193
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,479
has to be distributed from somewhere and

194
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,840
this can be interesting as in

195
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,680
finding new payloads or finding

196
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,639
variations of existing ones as well as

197
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,440
even

198
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,120
finding campaigns ideally so what this

199
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,000
talk focuses

200
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,400
on is options two and three so getting

201
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,199
general graphs

202
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,720
of attacks and finding open deers

203
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
deploying honeypots in your own network

204
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,599
has some drawbacks and considerations

205
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,879
that should be seen

206
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,479
as yeah different than at least getting

207
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,399
open deers and getting a general grasp

208
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,958
of attacks

209
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,399
so maybe it's time to tell you

210
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,000
how i got into this because

211
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,399
many years ago i set up an ftp server

212
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,920
with uh

213
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,200
quite weak credentials by accident and

214
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,640
it ended up hosting things that i

215
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,839
definitely did not put there so

216
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,080
i then started noticing that basically

217
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,959
every

218
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,360
public-facing service was getting

219
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,160
brute-forced more or less

220
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,320
and years later i i revisited this topic

221
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,680
by uh using a raspberry pi

222
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,680
or starting with a raspberry pi

223
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,880
installing kaori

224
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,839
the medium interaction ssh unipod on it

225
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,480
and just

226
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,519
having it running in my home network and

227
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,640
it ended up being a multi-install

228
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,279
multi-install system that is spanning

229
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,000
the globe on different vpss

230
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,240
and i then started seeing that crawling

231
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,680
logs of every

232
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,080
single honeypot by hand is a tedious

233
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,240
task so i wanted to do centralized

234
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,320
visualization

235
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,440
and when i had this i ended up thinking

236
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,560
well i do have visualization but i still

237
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,080
need to copy and paste

238
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,880
every single payload around and then as

239
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,959
still ssh to the honeypots to find

240
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,320
something

241
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,200
so i started automated collection and

242
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,160
storage

243
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,519
in the platform which is misp and

244
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,399
finally i thought about i can that i can

245
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,440
even enrich

246
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,040
uh based on miss and with miss

247
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,839
so unfortunately because of the time

248
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:16,399
frame

249
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,519
uh we will just focus

250
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,760
on the visualization part and the

251
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,640
deployment and collection of data

252
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,880
but again if you're interested in more

253
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,680
just

254
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,920
hit me up i will gladly tell you more

255
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,760
about this

256
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,519
so how do you collect data

257
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,800
basically you can start with yeah spare

258
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,360
hardware that you've got lying around

259
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,680
and even use vpss so the pull

260
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,440
the the possibilities i endless

261
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,920
so i started with a single used

262
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,440
raspberry pi 1b

263
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,399
so there is basically no excuse in not

264
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,959
doing this

265
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,720
what i would recommend you to do is uh

266
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,120
scenario one if you do this for an

267
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,240
internal honeypot

268
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,839
deployment as in maybe a preemptive

269
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:10,880
system

270
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,920
that is that shouldn't be known by

271
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,200
anyone

272
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,160
then please do not expose this honeypot

273
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,079
to the internet because you need to put

274
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:20,399
it

275
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,680
near your production servers and

276
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,920
having something vulnerable in the same

277
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,000
network as your production servers

278
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,040
isn't something that you should do at

279
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,440
least

280
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,800
not with public access so if you want to

281
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,360
have public access on your honeypot

282
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,480
please do this

283
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,920
by putting the honeypot into a dmz or

284
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,800
at least having it separated in a

285
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,480
different network than your

286
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,240
production environment so you should

287
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,360
treat your honeypot as a

288
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,000
throwaway system so please do not use

289
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,200
production data

290
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,800
so no no reuse of usernames

291
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,160
passwords or ssh keys and please try to

292
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,839
avoid root

293
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,240
i will tell you a little story about

294
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,880
that later on

295
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,000
so what's important is

296
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,639
you're exposing code to the world that

297
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,680
looks vulnerable

298
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,440
but it most likely is vulnerable but in

299
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,000
other ways

300
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,519
than you'd think so the attacker has the

301
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,480
advantage here

302
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,279
so they have infinite time and ways to

303
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:31,680
try

304
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,880
things you on the other hand need to

305
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,560
mess up once

306
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,200
for them being able to possibly own the

307
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,800
system and everything in the same

308
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,480
network

309
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,200
which brings me to the next point of

310
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,000
detection

311
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,600
and evasion so

312
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,399
what's happening outside is that people

313
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,920
constantly try to

314
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,440
detect and debate honeypots because

315
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,120
they don't want their payloads analyzed

316
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,839
by researchers as you would think

317
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,920
so one of the easiest things that you

318
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,040
can do

319
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,079
is evaluating

320
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,200
host names service versions uh

321
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,279
and trying default usernames and

322
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,880
passwords so

323
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,320
that's something if you get a honeypot

324
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,959
and you

325
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,240
set it up please try to change as many

326
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,440
default settings as you can because

327
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,000
for example what you can see here is

328
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,480
that

329
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,320
kaori default used to have the host name

330
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,079
svr04 which

331
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,839
led to automated attacks

332
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,240
trying to or passing the hostname and

333
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,399
then disconnecting if they found that

334
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,199
the system

335
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,199
had this hostname another common thing

336
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,120
that um that authors try

337
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,240
to evade honeypots is

338
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,760
using a shell script or a multi-stage

339
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,120
payload

340
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,480
um to try and um

341
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,959
and and make use of one of the main

342
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,079
principles of

343
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,240
low and medium interaction honeypots

344
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,199
especially

345
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,720
these two tend to uh disown

346
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,320
um these own payloads as soon as or

347
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,160
and files as soon as they are written to

348
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,279
disk so that they cannot be executed

349
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,199
which means if you upload a bash script

350
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,240
to a honeypot and try to execute this

351
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,639
afterwards it won't be there it won't

352
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,360
work

353
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,800
and therefore you successfully invaded

354
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,000
the honeypot what you can do against

355
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,600
this

356
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,199
is basically only uh the use of high

357
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,560
interaction honeypots

358
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,240
that emulate a full system

359
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,120
but the whole thing is a cat and mouse

360
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,519
game

361
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,160
and if you are interested in a little

362
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,560
bit

363
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,480
more of detail about this

364
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,360
i can happily recommend you the torque

365
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,760
breaking honeypots for fun and profit

366
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,240
which which is a very interesting talk

367
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,320
that goes a little bit more into detail

368
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,600
on

369
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,480
which honeypots can be detected in which

370
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,920
way so they are

371
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,959
they they they present some common and

372
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,639
interesting ways how they

373
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,120
uh were able to find honey pots

374
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,959
and as i mentioned before

375
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,079
the most important thing is

376
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,000
try to customize your honey pot so

377
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,279
most attacks out there are automated

378
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,720
which means there is no human that

379
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,160
looks at every single thing or every

380
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,279
single connection

381
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,079
their scripts do so if you want to

382
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,120
evade this

383
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,880
if you want to try and keep them

384
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,240
keep them on your pot try to change as

385
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,000
much defaults as you can and

386
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,120
also make the make your servers look

387
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,320
real so

388
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,800
that's another thing if you think about

389
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
a mongodb cluster

390
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,519
it is unlikely that a big mongodb

391
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,600
cluster deployment of

392
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,440
five or six five or six machines

393
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,519
that every single machine of them has

394
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,839
only 256

395
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,360
mbs of ram so try to make it look real

396
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,519
try to have reasonable sizing

397
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,720
you don't have to have it in hardware

398
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,079
but make the honeypot show

399
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,040
reasonable sizing which is something

400
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,079
that it can do

401
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,440
usually and also think about cluster

402
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,320
state

403
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,360
that's something that especially bigger

404
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,040
deployments

405
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,360
are quite good at in emulating

406
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,359
so you've got all your honey pots

407
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,559
up and running now but

408
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,160
they look like this so all you can see

409
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,839
is text scrolling down your screen

410
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,520
which is something that is not nice to

411
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,359
read for humans

412
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,480
so what can you do what can i recommend

413
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,400
you to do is

414
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,600
use something like splunk or elastic

415
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,039
to find to sift through this haystack of

416
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,440
semi-structured log data and visualize

417
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,960
it

418
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,080
how can this look in reality just as a

419
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,919
quick glance

420
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,559
as you can see here this is my live

421
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,280
splunk deployment um

422
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,200
and as you can see this is kind of an

423
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,840
overview of the main

424
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
yeah this is the main dashboard that

425
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,480
then branches out into

426
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,960
details on how each honeypot performs

427
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,880
so if we take an iot honeypot that

428
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,679
we've developed ourselves you can see

429
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,200
that

430
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,799
we've got quite a bit of insight in how

431
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,440
this honeypot is used how it get got hit

432
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,160
and

433
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,520
what people do on it

434
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,520
so

435
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,880
basically um this

436
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,679
visualization is something that heavily

437
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,039
depends on your use case

438
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,799
so it is always best recommended best

439
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,360
practice

440
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,160
to define your use case and especially

441
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,320
define what you want to see or

442
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,200
visualize beforehand and then building

443
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,200
dashboards and visualizations for this

444
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,880
and there is something that you should

445
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,840
keep in mind when you build

446
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,880
dashboards which is filtering noise

447
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,480
what you see here is something

448
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
this is these are payloads that got

449
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,520
uploaded

450
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,400
and if you have a look at the shot

451
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,799
hashes you can see that every

452
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,080
payload has a different hash but

453
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,200
all of them share a common file name or

454
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,559
upload path

455
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,200
and this is where you can see that these

456
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,120
so these files don't hold

457
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,440
any valuable information they are just

458
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,520
generated noise

459
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,320
and this is something you should always

460
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,720
be on the lookout for

461
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,520
especially as it pollutes your uh your

462
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,480
visualization

463
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,400
and your dashboards but

464
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,760
enough from the technicalities let's

465
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,840
have some fun and look at the fun stuff

466
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,160
which is also known as everybody face

467
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
from time to time

468
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,280
so what this is is common pitfalls that

469
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,520
i

470
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,760
encountered in running honeypots and

471
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,679
common pitfalls that

472
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,919
users of my honeypots encountered so

473
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,400
what happens to me more often than i

474
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,080
would like to to

475
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,280
admit is uh i connect to my honeypots or

476
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,120
want to connect to my honeypots for some

477
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,960
quick maintenance

478
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,360
and i'm wondering why my sshk isn't

479
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,000
working

480
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,840
i mean i'm sure it's the right password

481
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,000
so

482
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,280
think about it what could happen

483
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,080
and yes so this

484
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,360
usually uh ends up me being

485
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,159
me just could really connecting to the

486
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,919
honeypot itself and not on the host

487
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:36,960
system

488
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,080
so i reset all my passwords keys scrub

489
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,520
all of my data out of my splunk

490
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,320
dashboards

491
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,840
and basically do a cleanup on l5

492
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,679
unfortunately so

493
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,039
all infrastructure was up and running at

494
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,480
one point

495
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,679
so i had multiple vps providers running

496
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,799
my honeypots

497
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,159
and i had all my infrastructure spread

498
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,600
around the world

499
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,960
the problem was there was quite a big

500
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,120
debt pooling scam going on and

501
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,520
mind you this is my private money as it

502
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,919
this is my private project

503
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,480
so i chose the least expensive providers

504
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,600
that i could find which all

505
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,039
basically closed down without further

506
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,559
notice so

507
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,799
all my honeypot infrastructure was gone

508
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,240
in the process of having my

509
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,480
infrastructure i decided to move splunk

510
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,520
to another host

511
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,880
so splunk holds at this point

512
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,840
holds all of my data and all of my

513
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,799
payloads and

514
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,840
executed commands

515
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,400
and i forgot to check backups which

516
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,679
means

517
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,679
yeah i tried to move it i just i decided

518
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,000
on

519
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,159
just deleting it on on the one provider

520
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,000
and then using my backup

521
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,679
to restore it on another one and yeah

522
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,880
basically i'm not the only one that this

523
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,960
happened to

524
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,240
so please check your backups

525
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,280
check that backups are done and verify

526
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,600
your backups

527
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,159
it's a heartfelt thing that you should

528
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,400
think of

529
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,440
so what i also did and what i wouldn't

530
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,000
recommend

531
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,400
is deploying honeypots to system python

532
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,360
so

533
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,440
i would recommend at least if you're

534
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,280
running python

535
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,440
python honeypots use a virtualmf because

536
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,480
the next apt update will definitely

537
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,280
update some python dependency and this

538
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,679
will

539
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,400
break all of your honeypots at least

540
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,520
this is what happened to me

541
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,360
what i also did was i updated the list

542
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,200
of allowed passwords

543
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,640
on one of my honeypots and i started

544
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,600
seeing lots of denied password attempts

545
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,240
and

546
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,440
yeah i ended up

547
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,400
pasting the wrong format for the file

548
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:10,880
which

549
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,120
allowed my honeypot no more logins at

550
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,240
all

551
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,840
and that's something yeah i haven't seen

552
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,240
because i was monitoring my honeypot so

553
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,520
maybe either have this done

554
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,520
by configuration management as an

555
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,880
ansible or

556
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,440
maybe monitor your your honeypots which

557
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,520
is also a thing that i would recommend

558
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,720
and finally there it is again

559
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,919
please do not run your honeypots as rude

560
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,039
i did this the system

561
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,520
got owned quicker than i would like to

562
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,559
admit

563
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,000
and yeah i ended up rebuilding the whole

564
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,400
system please don't make the same

565
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,200
mistake i did

566
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,039
so basically best practices please

567
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,480
monitor your honey pots

568
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,520
especially storage and services

569
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,080
as in are they running correctly are

570
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,279
they

571
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,919
are they storing is there enough storage

572
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,440
is there enough room

573
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,400
and regularly clean your payloads and

574
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
payloads and logs

575
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,720
because what happens is you can have the

576
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,880
best honeypot infrastructure

577
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,919
if the device is full it's full

578
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,039
so what have i found as well

579
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,400
um i have found something

580
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,039
some high or i can give some best

581
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,279
practices maybe for aspiring developers

582
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,320
which is

583
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,559
maybe do something after you connect so

584
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,440
this is something

585
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,559
from my smtp honeypot and as you can see

586
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,559
uh this is the connection count per

587
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,159
minute so

588
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,279
there is a barely noticeable spike with

589
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,360
with uh 250 connections from a single ip

590
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:53,760
in

591
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,720
in two minutes i mean maybe my honeypot

592
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,520
is broken

593
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,559
but it feels a little bit

594
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,880
like this so

595
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,960
another option is please provide actual

596
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,600
login data if you try to log into one of

597
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,520
my systems because

598
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,559
if you're using the port and the ip that

599
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:14,880
is

600
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,880
definitely something that shouldn't be

601
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,400
in username and password

602
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,360
or system commands shouldn't be username

603
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,799
password

604
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,919
or your any file title

605
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,159
for login shouldn't be there

606
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,320
and finally always check your strings

607
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,720
so in this case

608
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,600
the avid reader might have seen it as in

609
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,320
this is an

610
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,399
invalid address so there's no ip address

611
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,240
and that this there's something

612
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,279
also interesting for me because uh this

613
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,880
is something that happened on my adb

614
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,080
honeypot

615
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,320
more often than on any other honeypot

616
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,840
attackers just dumped all their

617
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,919
payloads in a hail mary attack and tried

618
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,840
to execute them which means

619
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,039
i get to have all your fancy honeypot uh

620
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,039
all your fancy payloads on my honeypot

621
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,600
and finally there's some just

622
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,480
weird things that i found over the time

623
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,520
so

624
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,640
for example these are user agents on my

625
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,440
honeypot

626
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,760
on my iot honeypot and keep in mind

627
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,520
these are easily forgeable

628
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,559
but there's something interesting as in

629
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,320
there are some messages from well-known

630
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,080
agents and well-known services

631
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,360
and then there's this i still don't know

632
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,320
how this got there

633
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,919
and there's always this one special

634
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,120
friend you have

635
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,799
that runs his own asn

636
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,919
which is also an interesting thing to

637
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:00,240
see

638
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,000
on your honeypot infrastructure

639
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,360
and finally having a look

640
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,240
at things that get uploaded is something

641
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,760
that is definitely

642
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,279
always worth a shot for example this is

643
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,960
an ssh key or public part of an ssh key

644
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,720
and if you find this in your

645
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,880
infrastructure

646
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,120
you should maybe start thinking about

647
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,279
if you're getting breached or not

648
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,399
because

649
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,600
this is an ongoing distribution of an

650
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,360
ssh key and this key

651
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,000
i started seeing it roughly in december

652
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,600
last year

653
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,960
and to this date i have i have catched

654
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,679
it from

655
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,360
more than 1 100 different source ips so

656
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,120
if you find this in your infrastructure

657
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,760
maybe think about nuking your most of

658
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,320
your infrastructure

659
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,000
so conclusion the next

660
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,080
things for me are high interaction

661
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,240
honeypots on nested virtualization

662
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,799
which is the thing that is quite complex

663
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:07,360
but

664
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,919
is getting more and more usable by day

665
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,039
and in general i would like to do

666
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,679
more tooling and integration tooling

667
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,720
integration and more

668
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,399
automation as in i'm not good at reverse

669
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,360
engineering so

670
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,799
i'm leaning on my strong suits

671
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,399
in automation and building workflows

672
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,600
that do stuff automatically without

673
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,039
me interfering with it

674
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,440
i want to give you on the other hand the

675
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,080
chance to

676
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,360
to use the things that we've built

677
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,799
and profit from the research we did

678
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,559
which is um i can recommend you

679
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,000
the um the honeypots that we've built

680
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,799
and the splunk dashboard that i have

681
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,440
shown you

682
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,679
in this presentation you can download

683
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,360
these and use them with

684
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,159
little tuning in your own infrastructure
