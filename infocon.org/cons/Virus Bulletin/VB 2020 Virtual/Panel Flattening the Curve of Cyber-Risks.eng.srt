good day i'm kathy whitby

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,759
and i'm a program manager with unit 42

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,520
with palo alto networks

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,360
today i am pleased to be with some

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,200
wonderful people who have important

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,040
insights to share with us

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,920
on flattening the curve of cyber risks

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,199
please take a moment to introduce

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,039

i'm a coordinator at the national

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,399
cyber security center in the netherlands

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,840
i'm managing the threat intelligence

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,399
teams and

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,440
that's about it hi

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,480
i'm derek menke i'm with 40 guard labs

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,879
from fortinet i have 20 plus years

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,120
experience in the industry over 16 at 40

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,920
minute now

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,520
i lead our global threat intelligence

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,280
team with sportinggradlabs so this

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,840
is um doing data science and processing

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,280
of threat telemetry

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,199
but also working on our global threat

30
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,040
alliances including

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,200
the cyber threat alliance as well of

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,159
course so very happy to be here thanks

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:12,720
everyone

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,720
and as you can see we have we have quite

35
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,040
a an array of expertise here on our

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,400
panel this morning

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,799
um what this panel intends to do is to

38
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,799
shed some light on the do's and don'ts

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,720
on what corporations should or should

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,640
not do to flatten the curve of cyber

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,520
risks

42
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,079
to minimize any impact on your networks

43
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,759
and to provide you with the necessary

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,520
resilience

45
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,600
norte let's start the conversation with

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,759
the important topic of what actually

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,479
makes good

48
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,079
quality threat intelligence well kathy

49
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,880
i think everybody agrees on uh threat

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,759
intelligence

51
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,920
that it has to be relevant and timely

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,640
accurate and that it has to be reliable

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,640
of course and all those things

54
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,119
but i think what's what's really

55
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,119
important for threat intelligence to be

56
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,240
is that it gives

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,439
information on the probability and the

58
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,000
impact of certain digital attacks

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,639
and what i specifically look for in

60
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,639
threat intelligence is to combine

61
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,360
technical information like indicators

62
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,760
with

63
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,400
uh contextual information or tactical

64
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,120
context

65
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,080
or what you want to call it because it's

66
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,560
very

67
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,120
important where that you know what

68
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
you're going to do

69
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,200
to deal with in case of cyber attacks

70
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,360
and who you're going to deal with

71
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,319
i think um technical indicators are

72
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,080
sometimes not

73
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,760
threat intelligence at all they

74
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,840
give a huge false amount of false

75
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,040
positives

76
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,800
and i think what really gives

77
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,640
organizations a view of the threat

78
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,200
is this information on the modus

79
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,000
operandi

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,239
and the motives of the party behind it

81
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,440
and the probability

82
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,280
that it can get into their systems as

83
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,560
well

84
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,959
okay derek

85
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:03,840
what do you think some of the

86
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,920
prerequisites are for cyber security

87
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,680
threat intelligence to be effective for

88
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,400
our organizations

89
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,280
yeah so i guess i'll i'll pause for a

90
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,159
second and say

91
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,720
it really depends on the organization

92
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,599
first and

93
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,840
i think we can talk about that later uh

94
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,280
you know in my experience

95
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,040
um first of all there's a difference

96
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,959
between information

97
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,959
intelligence knowledge um as as was just

98
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,159
said you know

99
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,840
if we look back 10 years ago all too

100
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,480
often what people would misquote or

101
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,879
talk about intelligence would just be a

102
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,400
flat list of indicators

103
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,040
um that was sufficient 10 years ago

104
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,400
nowadays

105
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,519
we really need more rich information uh

106
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,920
enriched information when it comes to uh

107
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,319
to good true threat intelligence

108
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,920
so there needs to be some work put in

109
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,319
between layers of automation ai machine

110
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,040
learning all that

111
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,720
all that stuff on the data stack can but

112
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,400
also the humans and really

113
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,040
the context uh it is key i agree with

114
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,640
that so that is definitely one

115
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,599
uh prerequisite not just the what you

116
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,720
know but the why

117
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,040
um the how ultimately getting into when

118
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,959
we build playbooks into the attribution

119
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,439
that the cube with the hoopies

120
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,399
um so yeah the context is probably one

121
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,279
of the most

122
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,279
one of the most important uh pieces

123
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,959
today as a prereq

124
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,440
uh also having you know making sure that

125
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,000
it's

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,440
fresh and agile those have to be

127
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,360
combined together i think obviously

128
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,560
when we have fresh fresh intelligence

129
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,160
we want to make that agile we want to

130
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,680
get um put that

131
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,759
uh the rubber to the road like i said

132
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,520
which leads me to my last pre-rack i

133
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:37,919
think

134
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,600
and the most important i know we talk

135
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,680
about this a lot is is actionable threat

136
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,880
intelligence

137
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,560
so we also refer to this as the last

138
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,000
mile problem

139
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,479
so when you receive intelligence how do

140
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,240
you cross that last mile how do you put

141
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,000
that intelligence to use

142
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,400
and different organizations um have

143
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,000
different ways to do that so that's

144
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,040
really important

145
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,880
i guess the last thing i'll also say and

146
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,479
maybe this is more of a processing with

147
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,240
intelligence for a prereq

148
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,600
is how do you um how do you prioritize

149
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,520
that because

150
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,639
a lot of the times when we talk about

151
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,400
automation and intelligence uh there's

152
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,039
just

153
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,759
too much people um kind of roll over

154
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,440
with fatigue sometimes or they're

155
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,440
overwhelmed or overloaded

156
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
so that's more of a cso perspective as

157
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,000
how do you try start to prioritize the

158
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
intelligence that you receive

159
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,039
um uh when it comes to making that

160
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,280
actionable sometimes if it's a human

161
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,479
you know a human applying that

162
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,320
intelligence there's there's resource

163
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,080
and bandwidth issues as well

164
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,960
so i guess four foot four prerequisite

165
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,440
in my

166
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,960
life and derek just to add on to that um

167
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,360
you and i go way back from a cyber cyber

168
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,320
security um

169
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,520
perspective with the cyber threat

170
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,600
alliance how have you seen the

171
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,199
cyber threat alliance and other sharing

172
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,440
organizations grow because of the

173
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,240
this need and these um prerequisites

174
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,319
that you've identified

175
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,919
well it's it's it's been a fantastic

176
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,600
journey uh specifically with the cta

177
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,919
it's been a while now yeah it's been

178
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,639
going on six over six years yeah so it's

179
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,919
uh

180
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,160
it's growing with with the solutions

181
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,840
that we've created to be honest again i

182
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,360
don't think we could have done this uh

183
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,720
six years ago

184
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,240
um so some of the things that we

185
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,680
mentioned you know being agile about

186
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,960
putting into action you need the

187
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,880
technology pieces we needed

188
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,800
languages like you know sticks version

189
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,720
two which grew from

190
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,639
older versions of sticks 1.1 as an

191
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,039
example to be able to really um

192
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,360
you know not only describe the things we

193
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,960
need to do in a more efficient way

194
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,720
but be able to have a platform to share

195
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,000
that on a on

196
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
and this is very important i think on an

197
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,360
automation level and a human level

198
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,160
there's both i

199
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
i look at thread intel as a stack right

200
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,520
so the osi model

201
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,440
you have at the bottom layer you have

202
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,680
automation the machine learning and ai

203
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,599
and then humans sit sitting more on top

204
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,080
so it's escalation costs and how you can

205
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,560
pass that up and that ecosystem i think

206
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,919
has been created with the cyber threat

207
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:56,880
alliance which is

208
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,080
fantastic yeah thank you for sharing

209
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,160
that insight um

210
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,599
richard to add on to this um tell us a

211
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,639
little bit about what

212
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,280
what you see from a media perspective

213
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,280
and how proper information in and from

214
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,120
the media is affecting the productivity

215
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,880
of our ecosystem

216
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,360
oh that's a good point you're racing

217
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,840
proper information from and 2d media is

218
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,240
really

219
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,199
important actually adding on to the

220
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,560
topic that derek just mentioned the

221
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
context

222
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,479
information can be applied when you have

223
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,240
threat intelligence from the media

224
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,240
and they are not correct you could

225
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
actually be more devastating

226
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,400
looking your entire infrastructure down

227
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,520
for nothing

228
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
or it's incomplete and you start to

229
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,720
assume things

230
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,080
which can actually make things worse

231
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,919
as an example people always say you

232
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,280
should never pay

233
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,080
like for ransomware to the people

234
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,680
universities have done that even in the

235
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,319
netherlands

236
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,720
but the pool tax is missing and if you

237
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,479
know that the students already have a

238
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,720
really bad year because of kovac 19

239
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,080
pandemic

240
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,520
and now losing all the work i understand

241
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,639
university paid many people don't now

242
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,479
what if the university suddenly was on

243
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,319
the breakthrough of a

244
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,520
profit 19 vaccine then it's only a very

245
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,000
small

246
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,800
payment to get progress so the context

247
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,840
changes and suddenly

248
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,639
the threat intelligence uh context

249
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,680
changes to it and

250
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,599
then it's accepted so the proper

251
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,520
information from the media but also from

252
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,280
companies towards the media is really

253
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,758
important

254
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,080
yeah i think that's a great great great

255
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,279
point i agree

256
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,039
context seems to be an overlying theme

257
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,799
here because it does also help

258
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,440
with with uh the other point that was

259
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,080
mentioned earlier

260
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,719
on on verification too um the more

261
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,320
context you have

262
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,839
this with investigations any

263
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,519
investigation too right the more

264
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,040
the more the more trust you can have in

265
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,640
it the more confidence you can have in

266
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,360
it

267
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,000
yeah and we've seen that in research as

268
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,880
well like

269
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,640
if if like a threat is actually

270
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,600
attacking an ip number 10 10 10 10

271
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,440
what does it say it's oh it's an

272
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,600
intranet id

273
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,120
not important but if it in your

274
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,040
organization is the classified document

275
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,080
server

276
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,760
yeah a little bit more important context

277
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,279
yeah and this is something that actually

278
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,200
we as an example we reward in the cyber

279
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,000
threat alliance

280
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
for sightings right if more than one

281
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,399
member c sees the same thing verifies

282
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,040
that

283
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,120
that that is no additional context for

284
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,959
that right i'd say it's just another

285
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:27,680
piece of

286
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,399
of context which helps to make it more

287
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,920
more reliable

288
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,040
but i think in the case uh richard

289
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,760
mentioned

290
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,680
the university of maastricht that got

291
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,080
hit by a ransomware

292
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,519
earlier this year um they they

293
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,040
thought that quite well they they sought

294
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,320
they saw the media they held a symposium

295
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,440
and they called for openness and uh for

296
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:53,839
uh

297
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,800
sharing of threat information on the

298
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,040
kind of attacks that they were hit by so

299
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,680
i think

300
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,800
in context

301
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
if you look towards media attention if

302
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,200
you do it right in the right way

303
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,959
in the right way of openness and sharing

304
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,720
of information then it can be really

305
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,120
productive as well

306
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,279
yeah and if the information information

307
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,880
in the media is right and really

308
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,720
explaining why it has been done

309
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,200
it can even be accepted or in this case

310
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,720
it makes threat intelligence

311
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,600
more acceptable and more understandable

312
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,480
as well

313
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,920
yeah so that leads me to a

314
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,079
our next question and i think it's a

315
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,920
pretty interesting thing to consider

316
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,120
um what is it that

317
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,640
sharing this threat intelligence

318
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,120
information is helping us to

319
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,839
make the work of the cyber adversaries

320
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,959
harder

321
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,399
yeah so yeah so again this comes down to

322
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,000
the ecosystem to me um so every

323
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
er as for the cyber threat alliance as

324
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,240
an example we can refer to that as

325
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,880
an ecosystem a platform um you know to

326
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,279
me

327
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,279
every member has different backgrounds

328
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,440
um there's some overlap for sure

329
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,480
but again it's it's about how we

330
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,880
uh you know the overarching goal is is

331
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,640
how do we make it more expensive for

332
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,480
cyber criminal software

333
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,079
so if you look at it from a strategic

334
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,839
standpoint there's there's various

335
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,519
models and ways to do that of course

336
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,160
right

337
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,360
if you look at it from a vendor

338
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,200
standpoint it's mitigation

339
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,839
right so it's resiliency of networks uh

340
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,640
adding more

341
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,279
security controls by making that uh you

342
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,480
know intelligence quick

343
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,120
actionable um in other words making it a

344
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,279
pain to cyber criminals uh to try to get

345
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,160
into

346
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,519
uh networks and systems um you know the

347
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,040
more resiliency

348
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,120
you know they're often unless we're

349
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,600
talking about targeted attacks as well

350
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,160
you know the lions or bulk majority of

351
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,680
attacks that we see with cyber crime are

352
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,240
after

353
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,279
the low-hanging fruit um and

354
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,279
if if they see that there's no low

355
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,880
hanging fruit and there's more resilient

356
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,240
networks they're going to go notching on

357
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,680
someone else's store

358
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,079
that's just one part of the strategy

359
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,680
right but if we look at

360
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,160
how um because you know if they have to

361
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,519
go back to the drawing board and they

362
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,320
have to

363
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,639
put more r d resources on their end to

364
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,920
create a new piece of

365
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
malware or a zero day exploit that's

366
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,600
going to cost money right

367
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,519
um so it's the same so that's one one

368
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,120
piece with you know the other piece is

369
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,519
from

370
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,079
looking at obviously from a disruption

371
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:22,800
standpoint

372
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,720
and we have certain online so i won't

373
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,320
talk too much about that

374
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,920
but that comes down to description of

375
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,680
infrastructure right uh trying to take

376
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
c2 servers offline and

377
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,760
infrastructure how they operate again

378
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,519
they have to be forced to make another

379
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,240
move

380
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
um and then obviously there's the

381
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,079
attribution piece so that's that's

382
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,399
going after uh what i call cutting off

383
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,279
the head of the snake

384
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,760
going after the the top top level of

385
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,000
their cyber criminal organizations

386
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,920
uh through attribution that comes down

387
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,120
to law enforcement prosecution arrest

388
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,320
which is probably you know freezing of

389
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,360
of assets on their end which is i think

390
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,800
one of the toughest things to do but

391
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,320
most rewarding too

392
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,320
okay um in addition to the expense

393
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,079
what are some examples you can give to

394
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,440
explain the pros and cons of sharing

395
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,040
threat intelligence information with law

396
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,959
enforcement agencies around the world

397
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,760
what do you think about that richard oh

398
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,240
i

399
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,000
i'm actually all in favor of sharing

400
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,279
with law enforcement

401
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,959
but as you mentioned it has pros and

402
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,200
cons um

403
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,000
pros because we can actually get much

404
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,240
more done with law enforcement present

405
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,040
taking it down uh the coolness that may

406
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,000
be way

407
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,399
slower to taking it down because law

408
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,360
enforcement has to

409
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,680
uh like follow certain protocols they

410
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,360
may do investigations

411
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,040
they they may need to take all the

412
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,560
evidence into account

413
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,920
uh official law agreement contracts with

414
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,680
different countries

415
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
and of course as long as the bad guys

416
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,519
are able to continue the more money they

417
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,800
make

418
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,279
so we could do it faster by not sharing

419
00:13:59,279 --> 00:13:59,839
but it

420
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,839
actually pays off to actually share

421
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,279
information because there's a bigger

422
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,360
chance that the attribution really works

423
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,959
and the bad guys will be already being

424
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,959
arrested and the whole

425
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,479
operation is being taken down

426
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,800
i know that like derek just mentioned

427
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,560
earlier we have different

428
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,399
views like different organizations but

429
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,760
derek and i obviously work for a

430
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,120
commercial organization

431
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
where we want to publish our research as

432
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,199
well when that is delayed that may have

433
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:25,760
a cost

434
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,600
then again i think the cost is marginal

435
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,279
compared to the benefit of sharing the

436
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,839
information

437
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,440
yeah from an um authority perspective

438
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,040
uh the mission of of the law enforcement

439
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,920
and and from the

440
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,279
uh search and then certainly our

441
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,399
national cert

442
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,519
is to give our constituency an

443
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,360
accurate look into the dutch threat

444
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,760
environment and we can't do that

445
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,240
without information being shared and we

446
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,160
are completely

447
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,079
dependent on parties to give us that

448
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,160
information so that we can

449
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,199
warn other parties in time

450
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,920
yeah and and kathy i look at it as a

451
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,639
reward aspect too i i do think so

452
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,880
you know generally when you talk about

453
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,000
intelligence sharing

454
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
the more stakeholders you bring to the

455
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,839
table um

456
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,000
you you start to bring in other you know

457
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,440
platforms other

458
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,760
backgrounds and frameworks which it's a

459
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,199
double-edged sword sometimes it's a good

460
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,720
it's a great thing

461
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,560
but sometimes it's it can make it

462
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,320
complicated as well so that's one of the

463
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,600
challenges i'd say we have in the

464
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,880
industry is how we can

465
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,600
try to make um well i wouldn't say make

466
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
it easier but overcome those challenges

467
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,199
and i think those are growing efforts

468
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,880
you know in my experience

469
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
the great news is in the industry when

470
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,720
it comes to this particularly with law

471
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,519
enforcement

472
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,519
and concerts is that there's great

473
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,880
willingness um

474
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,920
uh to to work together uh which is which

475
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,399
is a

476
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,800
really really good thing and it's been a

477
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,639
lot of progress made

478
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,959
and we already overcame the trust issue

479
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:57,920
with the

480
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,920
uh well within the industry where we

481
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,040
were competitors

482
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,000
so it's just a small hurdle to overtake

483
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,360
to also have that trust

484
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,759
relationship with the law enforcement

485
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,399
that

486
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,079
the the information stays contained

487
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,639
and gives credit where credit is due

488
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,160
yeah

489
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,759
and a lot of what we're talking about

490
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,079
here has to do with the technology

491
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,160
that we're using to gather information

492
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,320
to kind of sort through that information

493
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
um that type of thing what are some of

494
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,360
the successes

495
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,079
that you can share um when it comes to

496
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:30,639
people

497
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,560
person-to-person interaction so what are

498
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,160
some of the things that we're doing

499
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,639
from a personal perspective that's also

500
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,600
helping in this

501
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,360
and from a law enforcement perspective

502
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,120
or even just overall

503
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,440
as an industry

504
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,659
[Music]

505
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,519
who well it all starts with personal

506
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,160
trust

507
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,560
uh networking is an important part where

508
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,639
you first have to meet the people

509
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,240
it is really difficult to start a

510
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,839
trust-based relationship

511
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,519
with the new entity just we are here in

512
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,399
the tips track

513
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,359
sponsored by cta cta at one point was

514
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,039
new it was really difficult to really

515
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,400
trust cta because

516
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,559
what is it who is behind it once you

517
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,760
have met the people

518
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
and they're great people it is much

519
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,919
easier to build a trust relationship and

520
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:16,720
to start

521
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,280
sharing information and then after the

522
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,400
first or two

523
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,240
three cases you know they're not

524
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,439
misusing it so

525
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,679
it is easier to keep sharing information

526
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,280
and especially when they are sharing

527
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,440
back

528
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,679
yeah yeah exactly bi-directional is

529
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,200
really important that's another

530
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,520
that's another new new pre-wreck i think

531
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,880
that we can throw on there because

532
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,320
that's also really important the giving

533
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,520
back aspect

534
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,320
definitely yeah the i i think it's key

535
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,000
it's critical i mean

536
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,200
as i said we need the human to human

537
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,720
interaction you need to

538
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,039
meet faces to meet people you need to

539
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,160
have the

540
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,480
growing trust and track records too

541
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,080
because obviously as time goes on

542
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,200
there's going to be new

543
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,440
new stakeholders introduced through that

544
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,200
chain of trust too

545
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,520
so it's really important and and and

546
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,840
there's also the other piece kathy of

547
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,320
humans being able to as much as we like

548
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,160
to think that that

549
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,840
science and artificial intelligence

550
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,000
machine learning is is a great thing

551
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,160
it's really a tool and so you know

552
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,919
humans can solve things that machines

553
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,039
can't stop us

554
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,520
today but it's important to have that

555
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,440
it's just there's different problems

556
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,720
that's sort of what i meant about that

557
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,039
stacked model before um and you know a

558
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,000
lot of that comes down

559
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,080
to these you know when events are

560
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,760
breaking the strategy getting on

561
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,840
on phone calls and talking to each other

562
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,120
and trying to

563
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,200
come up with a consensus of how we

564
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,360
approach a problem and

565
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,120
um and roadmap things like that

566
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,559
and i think we've seen some really big

567
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,840
successes from a personal interaction

568
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,120
perspective

569
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,120
in the recent past when it comes to

570
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,440
cyber threats

571
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,200
a lot of information about cti is

572
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,480
focused on companies or how

573
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,640
organizations should integrate cti into

574
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,919
their processes

575
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,000
is there a difference between cti for

576
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,960
companies

577
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,120
and cti for national institutions like

578
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,600
certs

579
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,640
so i'll uh start with my view obviously

580
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,440
we

581
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,120
would love to hear the third point of

582
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,720
view as well um

583
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,039
so you know generally we say cyber crime

584
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,320
has no borders or

585
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,760
that's been said in the industry for

586
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,679
years which is generally true

587
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,960
but there are specific use cases um

588
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,080
for um private sector versus public

589
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,640
sector

590
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,440
um in my experience there's overlap for

591
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,080
sure um

592
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,918
you know there's a need to have the same

593
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,720
type of information that's shared it's

594
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,559
just that there's a difference often

595
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,000
in the transport mechanism in the format

596
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,320
of that information sometimes some

597
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,840
people want to speak sticks

598
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,520
some want to speak miss as an example

599
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,160
someone um

600
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,480
you know temptatively formatted um

601
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
documents that are sent over

602
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,039
um you know prosecutors as an example

603
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,080
will handle things so

604
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,400
we'll understand things see it in a

605
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,840
different level

606
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,159
than a security operations center would

607
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,559
typically in the private sector

608
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,919
um so you know there's the core of the

609
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,440
information i think is

610
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,200
all that context everything we need to

611
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,640
form is there

612
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,799
and it's useful in different aspects and

613
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,000
different formats and

614
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,400
the way that it's it's actionable and

615
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,440
applied so

616
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,520
so short answer um yes there is a

617
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,520
difference but long answer is it's still

618
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,159
relying

619
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,679
residing on that same um you know

620
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,640
the the same core of the intelligence

621
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,039
that i'd say

622
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,679
well i agree with derek the core of the

623
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,480
information

624
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,200
uh stays the same but i think where

625
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,000
organization

626
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,080
can organizations can take a look at

627
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,960
their assets and form a very clear

628
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,559
intel requirement based on that

629
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,720
search don't have that luxury they have

630
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,400
a whole constitution the

631
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,240
sea of parts or parties in different

632
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,840
sectors

633
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,840
on different maturity levels they have

634
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,640
to serve with their information

635
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,559
so it's quite hard and it can be quite

636
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,960
overwhelming to

637
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,880
actually collect stretch intelligence

638
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,760
without any requirements or with

639
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,640
actually all

640
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,679
kinds of requirements so

641
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,039
what we do is we we

642
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,880
made a portfolio a threat intel

643
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,240
portfolio

644
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,799
and that consists of different products

645
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:29,600
from

646
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,320
cti feeds to quarterly reports on

647
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,880
dutch threats so that organization can

648
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,000
pick

649
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,640
they can choose which product actually

650
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,919
gives them

651
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,760
intelligence value and also we

652
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,559
build on trust between specialists the

653
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,320
subject which we

654
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,240
handled previously so that the threshold

655
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,120
to call us if something happens becomes

656
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,280
quite low and people can

657
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,039
know when to contact us how to contact

658
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,480
us and ask for more

659
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,840
threat information on the things they

660
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,080
need

661
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,000
yeah i would also just quickly after

662
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,039
that what what nurses say is is the um

663
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,280
you know is is the the points of view i

664
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,960
guess that's the other difference right

665
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,000
um so that's attack surface that's you

666
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,520
know i call it the threat spectrum a lot

667
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,159
of the times

668
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,960
everyone has different ways of viewing

669
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,720
information so that's more of a

670
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,640
it comes also to that bi-directional

671
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,559
feedback right building exercise the

672
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,360
more that you

673
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,080
can share these different uh pieces of

674
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,919
view and combine them together

675
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,600
the more powerful that context can

676
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,840
become

677
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,679
absolutely so the last question i think

678
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:46,480
we have for

679
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,799
our conversation this morning is um

680
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,120
from the title of our of our panel here

681
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,960
flattening the curve of cyber risks

682
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,720
um with the covet 19 pandemic going on

683
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,360
in our world at the moment how has that

684
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,159
affected

685
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,159
cti in our organizations and what do we

686
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,760
anticipate changing

687
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,240
as people eventually head back into the

688
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,840
safe harbor of their corporate networks

689
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,880
in the office

690
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,240
what are some of the things we should be

691
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,679
on the lookout for and what can we

692
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,919
expect going forward

693
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,520
oh well let me go go to the final part

694
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,559
of the question what

695
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,240
what happens when people move back into

696
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,760
the office because everybody is working

697
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,080
from home

698
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,240
smart home equipment is selling like

699
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,400
crazy people are installing it

700
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,919
the apps on their phone and they're

701
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,200
bringing in those phones into your

702
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,799
corporate network again

703
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,400
and all those phones now are starting to

704
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,720
make connections to third-party clouds

705
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,240
for like the doorbell

706
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,440
and the cameras do you really want that

707
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,120
in your corporate environment that

708
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,039
suddenly a lot of third-party clouds are

709
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,080
being accessed

710
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,080
i think that is going to be one of the

711
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,760
the most

712
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,520
important points to really pay attention

713
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,799
to

714
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,840
i think that's a good one richard and i

715
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
think i i actually don't think people

716
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,080
will fully return to the office i

717
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,600
think that people are still working from

718
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,520
home from now on that now that we see

719
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,159
how

720
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,120
things actually can work so i think it's

721
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,760
uh

722
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,840
extra important to have safe connections

723
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,039
from from

724
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,600
home to the office network i think

725
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,120
people should be watching towards

726
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,520
threats to the availability of those

727
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,919
connections

728
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,480
yeah regard i have i have visions of

729
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,000
that wooden horse being ruled

730
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,799
into the castle when you talk about it

731
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,640
let me talk about that

732
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,480
yeah i i think that's a great point i

733
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,679
mean um and

734
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,400
you know to northeast point i think i

735
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,000
think it's going to be a hybrid model

736
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,840
going forward not everyone is going to

737
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,679
return to the office but you know i

738
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,320
always

739
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,200
with any any sort of event like this i

740
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,720
always like to see opportunity

741
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,240
the right side of things too obviously

742
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,919
there are a lot of challenges that we

743
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,039
have right now

744
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,240
um but one thing that you know um that

745
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,559
that's this pandemic has has done i

746
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,080
think is bring a lot of things to the

747
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,640
table

748
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,559
it's made it very visible to people as

749
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,240
to the problems that's happening

750
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,200
it's forced organizations to um rather

751
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,880
quickly which is not always a good thing

752
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,080
but at least

753
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,720
shift to um you know new security

754
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,400
measures for these devices that are

755
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,000
starting to

756
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,760
be outside of those corporate safeguards

757
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,919
for an extended period of time now um so

758
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,039
you know that's

759
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,200
there's an education aspect to it um so

760
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,799
the education i think is starting to

761
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,400
ramp up um you know

762
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,000
the vendors have been doing a lot of

763
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,400
campaigns on on coven 19 threats as an

764
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,480
example law enforcement interpol has

765
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,200
they have their

766
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,039
they watch their fiber hands campaign as

767
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,480
an example uh

768
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,320
all these things coming together that

769
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,480
ecosystem of stakeholders i think is

770
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,159
having an impact we've actually seen

771
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,520
kova 19

772
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,080
uh fishing lures drop off since march

773
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,679
and april as an example

774
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,000
um but other things take their place so

775
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,440
going into what we can

776
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,279
what we can expect moving forward is

777
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,480
it's not going to stop

778
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,840
there's always going to be that flavor

779
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,159
of the day and um

780
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,039
but the good news is i because as an

781
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:03,760
example is

782
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,360
trying to see an impact measure that

783
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,760
that success and seeing

784
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,520
cyber criminals shift their tactics

785
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,440
means what we're doing is having

786
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
an impact in a success it goes back to

787
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
that making it more expensive

788
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,320
which which helps to reduce or flatten

789
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,760
the curve i think with cyborgs

790
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,400
awesome were there any final thoughts

791
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,240
that any of you wanted to share with our

792
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,880

and um as the world isn't ever place

802
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,120
so are adversaries so it's something

803
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,000
that

804
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,400

for us

807
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,240
um in the realm of cyber security and

808
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,320
risk management thanks again everyone

809
