00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,439
hello and welcome to this presentation

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,040
on business email compromise

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,560
and more importantly our efforts to

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,400
combat it through scalable attribution

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,040
efforts

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,320
that are driving industry and law

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,400
enforcement collaboration

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,400
my name is pete reynolds i'm a principal

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,560
researcher at palo alto networks on unit

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,640
42 the threat intelligence team

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,880
i focus almost exclusively on managing

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,560
cyber threats

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,000
that said i'd also like to take the

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,519
opportunity to thank the cyber threat

15
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,640
alliance

16
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,160
for this wonderful opportunity to share

17
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,840
our insights across all the alliance

18
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,519
partners

19
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,120
that said in terms of business email

20
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,040
compromise i think it is definitely

21
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,880
relevant to start by noting that it is

22
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,719
now the most profitable form of cyber

23
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,520
crime

24
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,760
in the most recent ic3 the internet

25
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,200
crime complaint center report

26
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,680
released earlier this year global losses

27
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,039
in 2019 exceeded 1.7 billion dollars

28
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,840
billion with a b by comparison that

29
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,039
number is both

30
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,360
one greater than the estimated combined

31
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,280
losses of not pecha and wannacry

32
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,320
combined

33
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,480
and two also greater than the combined

34
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,359
losses of all

35
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,199
other forms of cyber crime that were

36
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,600
reported last year by ic3

37
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,520
so it is now the most prominent most

38
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,000
pressing cyber crime threat that we face

39
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,840
as a cyber security industry

40
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,040
recognizing the importance i want to

41
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,720
take a quick moment to talk through our

42
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,439
approach

43
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,360
that we've taken to palo alto networks

44
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,680
when we began our journey back in 2016

45
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,040
and trying to take a look at business

46
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,320
email compromise

47
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,080
we struggled to apply the traditional

48
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,759
analytic research models

49
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,600
uh to the threat as there was an absence

50
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,360
of reporting across industry to build

51
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,880
off of as a base

52
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,880
uh you know typically in terms of a

53
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,560
traditional research model you start

54
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,560
with one or two samples of malware

55
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,079
you look for other samples that are

56
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,720
similar to it uh you do some research to

57
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,159
add some interesting facts and then you

58
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,000
publish your findings and the community

59
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,520
as a whole will continue to build off

60
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
that cyclical reporting

61
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,000
model however starting from scratch

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,320
required a vastly different model to be

63
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,280
developed

64
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,200
and what we chose to do at the time is

65
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,119
we went and looked across our holdings

66
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,119
and we looked at five malware families

67
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,320
that we saw a lot

68
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,360
of use from commodity malware actors

69
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,199
we have since grown that to 20 malware

70
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,360
families but starting with the five

71
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,000
uh we went out and we asked our platform

72
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
to return all of the command and control

73
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,200
c2 domains

74
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,040
associated with all of the malware

75
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,400
samples that we had in those five

76
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,280
families

77
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,840
which tallied up to uh over a million

78
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,040
malware samples

79
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,720
uh in a million commanding control

80
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,440
domains we then went and ran the who is

81
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,120
lookups the registration lookups on all

82
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,720
those domains and we found that the vast

83
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,680
majority of them

84
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,160
uh the largest population that we're

85
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
linking back to nigerian email addresses

86
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,040
phone numbers

87
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,440
or street and state and country

88
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,400
addresses

89
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,720
so we focused our research very

90
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,480
specifically on nigeria because we saw

91
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,400
that being the largest population

92
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,920
pushing out commodity malware at the

93
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,280
time

94
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,040
from there we went back to the internet

95
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,720
we took those email addresses phone

96
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,239
numbers street addresses

97
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,159
and ran them back through domain

98
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,000
registration tools such as highest

99
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,920
passive total domain tools

100
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,000
to expand our data set beyond just the

101
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,040
malware we had

102
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,480
but also looking for all the other

103
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,840
domains these individuals have

104
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,920
registered over the years

105
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,879
and what that led us to is over 400

106
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,599
actors

107
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,360
51 000 samples of malware 20 000 domains

108
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,000
and 1.1 million attack sessions growing

109
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,959
rapidly

110
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,040
uh about four to five years later now

111
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,760
that allows us to do quite a few things

112
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,599
based on the breadth and depth

113
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,640
of both our data sets first we can look

114
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,680
at the

115
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,400
the construct and track general trends

116
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,760
and this is pretty generic here most

117
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,599
cyber security companies can do this

118
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,519
and in this case we see that the overall

119
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,000
attacks per month ballooned in 2019

120
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,480
almost three-fold with 172 percent

121
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,200
increase

122
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,440
so we see rapid growth continuing uh it

123
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,720
has continued to grow

124
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,200
rapidly since 2014 doubling and tripling

125
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,040
in size every year

126
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,200
diving a little bit deeper we can break

127
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,040
that down by information stealers and

128
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,799
remote administration tools

129
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,799
from information stealers we see for the

130
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,799
first time last year

131
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,799
that the number of information sailor

132
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,319
samples per month

133
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,200
declined but it declined below the rate

134
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,040
of remote administration tools

135
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,360
so for the first time we've seen actors

136
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,358
preferring remote administration tools

137
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,519
over the historic use of information

138
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,399
stealers

139
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,120
so that's a very fascinating interesting

140
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,880
bit of information we can deduce by this

141
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,479
massive amount of analysis that we're

142
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,840
conducting here

143
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,320
additionally we can divide this even

144
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,560
further and go down by specific malware

145
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,360
family

146
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,199
and this allows us to do two things it

147
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,560
allows us to figure out which tools are

148
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,479
most popular with the actors

149
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,639
but it also allows us to enable both law

150
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,479
enforcement to focus on the most popular

151
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:42,960
tools

152
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,880
and allow the cyber security industry

153
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,160
ourselves included

154
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,479
to focus on developing protections for

155
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,240
the most popular tools to make sure our

156
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,840
customers have the greatest protections

157
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,320
in place

158
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,240
now here's where i want to pivot a

159
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,680
little bit and start talking a little

160
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,240
bit about

161
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,160
attribution because while charts are

162
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,080
great attribution is what we're really

163
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,759
here to talk about today

164
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,600
so in terms of attribution from our

165
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,120
vantage point of power of the networks

166
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,479
we would break this down into three

167
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,680
levels there's going to be a low a

168
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,440
medium and a high level of attribution

169
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,039
that can be performed

170
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,280
on the lower end of the spectrum i think

171
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,120
what you'll see here in front of you is

172
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,840
a very easy automated approach to doing

173
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,000
grouping and clustering of data

174
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,160
across our million samples an hour and a

175
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,000
million c2 domains

176
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,759
we went through and we started grouping

177
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,560
them by like registration information so

178
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,400
matching phone numbers matching email

179
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,880
addresses used to register clusters of

180
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,759
domains

181
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,120
and then we grouped them just under a

182
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,520
name of actor 1 actor 2 actor 3

183
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,360
and then said this group of actors is

184
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,039
nigerian so we will call them silver

185
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,880
terrier actors

186
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,680
this analysis is exceptionally cheap it

187
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,520
is very easy to do

188
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,360
it simply requires a number of python

189
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,039
scripts to run against data sets

190
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,720
and you can get groupings and figure out

191
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,960
exactly or roughly how many actors are

192
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,039
playing in a space for a specific

193
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,240
geographic population however at the end

194
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,440
of day while cheap and easy

195
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,880
it doesn't give us a whole lot in terms

196
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,720
of defensive abilities or

197
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
any value that we can apply back into

198
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,759
our platform

199
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,360
in order to help provide protections for

200
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,520
our customers

201
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,199
on the completely opposite end of the

202
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,360
spectrum we have what we call high level

203
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,479
attribution

204
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,919
which is essentially

205
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,560
uh the ability to trace malware samples

206
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,160
through the infrastructure all the way

207
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,080
back to the actors themselves uh their

208
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,600
facebook accounts the vehicles they

209
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,280
drive their license plates

210
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,240
all their friends and in doing so we end

211
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,919
up with these beautiful pictures that

212
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,000
are awesome in blogs and are great in

213
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,360
marketing material

214
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,960
and are front page worthy on the

215
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,039
washington post or the new york times

216
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,960
but at the end of the day this level of

217
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,199
telemetry and this level of analysis

218
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,360
are very costly from a cyber security

219
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,639
company standpoint

220
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,120
tracing 400 actors down to this level of

221
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,000
fidelity

222
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,160
to pull up facebook accounts is great

223
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,440
and it's a pretty picture

224
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
but it's eight to 12 hours of manual

225
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,560
labor

226
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,400
of analyst time and analysts are the

227
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,000
most expensive thing in a computer

228
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,800
science or

229
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,000
any sort of tech company so ideally we

230
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,599
want to figure out how to automate most

231
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,080
of this

232
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,240
rather than doing it manually so that we

233
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,800
create efficiencies of scale

234
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,479
additionally it's worth pointing out

235
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,000
that while it is great that we can tell

236
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,840
you the license plate make model of the

237
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,919
vehicle he's driving in nigeria

238
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,680
that data does not provide a whole lot

239
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,280
of value back to the cyber security

240
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,520
industry in terms of being able to build

241
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,360
protections for the customer

242
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,080
so from here this is great but what we

243
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,199
found a happy

244
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,960
happy medium is what we would call

245
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,759
medium and scalable level attribution

246
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,440
rather than tracing an actor all the way

247
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,039
to his facebook account

248
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,720
what we found is that if we start with

249
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,680
low level attribution and build upon it

250
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,360
we can actually get to a point where we

251
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,280
can provide protections and better value

252
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,800
to our customers

253
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,120
so starting at the top left corner here

254
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,479
what we did is we started with the

255
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,919
domains that we knew about

256
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,160
the two domains you see there zero and

257
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,960
val net

258
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,440
and slow logger.im were two domains

259
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,120
associated with malware samples that we

260
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,720
had in our holdings

261
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,400
we pulled out the domain registration

262
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,080
details for those domains we saw that

263
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,120
they were linked

264
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
and then we started pivoting on both the

265
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,639
email address and phone number

266
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,879
to identify six more domains which you

267
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,479
see in the left column and box number

268
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,039
two

269
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,360
blind mice mail services server update

270
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,720
adobe doc

271
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,520
and the remaining two with that list we

272
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,360
then went out and pulled our peers

273
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,960
to see if they knew anything about those

274
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,879
domains and you see in box three that

275
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,879
bit defender kaspersky and sofos

276
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,640
also had alerts for three domains that

277
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,799
we had not seen in our telemetry yet

278
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,719
so we can instantly block those because

279
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,958
we know that two of the domains are bad

280
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,479
those three already look fishy from a

281
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,559
human standpoint and three other vendors

282
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,000
are also calling them bad

283
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,519
and that leaves us with just the last

284
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,120
part the last three domains in the list

285
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,920
there

286
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,360
and that's where a human would come in

287
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,120
at this point and take a look at all the

288
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,399
data that's been compiled by the

289
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,600
automated scripts

290
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,160
and say that the chances of adobe asking

291
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,839
a nigerian to register a domain for them

292
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,720
in india

293
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,320
is probably pretty low same as

294
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,480
switzerland credit union asking a

295
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,640
nigerian to register a domain for them

296
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,720
also pretty low so we can then make the

297
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,160
apply or we can

298
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,080
we can then build protections based on

299
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,680
applying blocking

300
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,560
preventing or allowing um across our

301
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,760
platform

302
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,519
based on the automated analysis that's

303
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,040
going to place that we can run

304
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,839
very quickly at scale across 400 actors

305
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,200
next we found that by conducting the

306
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,440
automated analysis and pivoting

307
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,000
at scale this actually tends to lead us

308
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,720
to a much

309
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,160
easier and more efficient approach to

310
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,640
getting to high level attribution

311
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,800
because all the pivoting tends to take

312
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,080
us back in time

313
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,760
we found that an actor today may be

314
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,200
doing malware activity

315
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,800
but four or five years ago their domain

316
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,480
registrations may have been legitimate

317
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,839
they may have been using their

318
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,680
their real personal email addresses for

319
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,360
school or university work

320
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,519
and from there we can link it to a skype

321
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,200
account or a facebook account or social

322
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,240
media account

323
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,680
and once we have one or two of the

324
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,240
individuals we can simply pivot through

325
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,000
their facebook accounts their myspace

326
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,800
accounts

327
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,399
we used to be able to use google plus

328
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,160
until that platform went down

329
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,000
but you can start to quickly identify

330
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,680
the one and two degrees of separation

331
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,240
across

332
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,480
all these actors so that when you find a

333
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,839
sample of malware that

334
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,440
jimmy registered and the folder

335
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,200
structure is

336
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,160
bad domain.com johnny you can search to

337
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,440
his friends list and pretty quickly

338
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,720
figure out who johnny

339
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,399
actually is based on the conversations

340
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,079
you see on the social media accounts

341
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,839
and you can build out the entire actor

342
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,399
map here for which i apologize is in

343
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,000
size two font and very difficult

344
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,560
to read but we're going to come back to

345
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,440
the slide in just a minute

346
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,279
so i'd like to shift focus now and in

347
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,440
the final minutes of this conversation i

348
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,200
want to talk a few minutes

349
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,240
about um

350
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,560
how we are going to affect change and

351
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,920
how we would like to drive

352
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,640
outcomes across all the industries to

353
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,880
help combat this threat

354
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,279
paramount to doing so we took a step

355
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,600
back to identify what we perceive to be

356
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,000
the major

357
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,240
hurdles impeding current efforts to

358
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
combat cyber crime and we came up with

359
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,600
these three that you see on the screen

360
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,040
are funding

361
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,519
first and foremost is silos and industry

362
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,040
culture

363
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,959
focusing on the technology finance and

364
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,360
cyber security communities and industry

365
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,160
segments

366
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,519
as a starting point we recognize that in

367
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,240
order for a law enforcement case to go

368
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,560
proceed be successful and go find and

369
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,920
arrest a bad guy

370
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,680
they really need information from all

371
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,440
three industry segments they need the

372
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,800
banks to identify

373
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,360
victims and dollar amount losses they

374
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,200
need the technology sector to provide

375
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
social media account and email account

376
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,519
um attribution telemetry

377
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,959
and they need the cyber security

378
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,120
community to provide phishing emails

379
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,680
uh malware samples so on and so forth so

380
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,880
all three industries

381
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,880
plus law enforcement need to come

382
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,399
together in order to solve this

383
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
this problem split um we can add

384
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,240
additional industries that provide

385
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,000
additional value but focusing on these

386
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,040
three for a starter we recognize that

387
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
there are cultures and regulations that

388
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,000
that impact

389
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,040
how these op these sectors collaborate

390
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,680
and how they share specifically we can

391
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,279
start with the technology sector

392
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,320
and more narrowly scoping it to email

393
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,600
service providers and social media

394
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,560
companies

395
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,399
collaborative efforts need to account

396
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,480
for user privacy controls and the

397
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,839
concerns

398
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,920
similarly in the finance sector banks

399
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,839
are tend to be heavily regulated here in

400
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:24,880
the united states

401
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,040
and therefore any evidence associated

402
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,720
with victims and loss amounts is also

403
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,440
highly

404
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,760
regulating controlled therefore finance

405
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
organizations can typically only share

406
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,040
details related to attack with law

407
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,959
enforcement but sharing with technology

408
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,240
companies cyber security companies is

409
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,120
much harder

410
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,279
when you focus on technology companies

411
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,880
they can share point-to-point but they

412
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,320
are very concerned about privacy and

413
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,120
don't want to share

414
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,200
uh broadly because you know they have

415
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,560
privacy concerns

416
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,399
that leads us back to ourselves which is

417
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,720
the cyber security industry

418
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,560
of the the three organizations we

419
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,760
probably have the least amount of

420
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,680
restrictions in place on us

421
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,600
we the data is ours we own it it's

422
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,760
coming across our centers our platforms

423
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,200
we don't necessarily have privacy

424
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,040
concerns with a lot of it we can mask

425
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,079
our customers

426
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,240
and the malware can be found in open

427
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,680
source repositories as well

428
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,760
so really there's not a whole lot of

429
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,040
proprietary data

430
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,639
from a cyber crime or combating cyber

431
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,639
crime perspective so of the

432
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,079
the industries in law enforcement

433
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,880
collaboration cyber security is best

434
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,600
postured

435
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,120
has a leash restriction and has

436
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,279
overlapping data sets with all the other

437
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:29,920
partners

438
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,079
and other industries to make us the most

439
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,440
successful so

440
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,519
recognizing that that complexity between

441
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,959
these three organizations is something

442
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,880
that we need to overcome

443
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,320
number two i want to focus on

444
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,079
traditional models of collaboration

445
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,440
because they're not really suited for

446
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,920
cross-industry and global collaboration

447
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,959
to combat this threat across the cyber

448
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,160
security community

449
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,079
we enjoy several point-to-point

450
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,079
relationships with both the finance

451
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:54,720
sector

452
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,639
the banking sector and law enforcement

453
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,160
and the tech sector

454
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,839
these relationships allow for a healthy

455
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,320
flow of information

456
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,720
consistent with a relevant value

457
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,519
proposition

458
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,519
and data control mechanisms that we set

459
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,920
up be it non-disclosure agreements

460
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,720
or other mechanisms that are in place

461
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,480
but this point-to-point relationship

462
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,279
does not scale we can't scale that to

463
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,279
any sort of efficiency

464
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,519
with 35 point-to-point relationships to

465
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,240
try and drive to a positive outcome

466
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,920
so conversely you have the model on the

467
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,680
left here which tends to be the model

468
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,160
that multiple companies

469
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,839
and i'm sorry it tends to be the fusion

470
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,079
model that is most often championed by

471
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,360
government and law enforcement

472
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,680
organizations in this model multiple

473
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,199
companies are asked to send an analyst

474
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,959
to work on a joint effort

475
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,120
in which the analysts across all the

476
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,320
companies come together

477
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,560
they can see each other's data set and

478
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,279
they can maximize collaboration

479
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,959
one example of this is the cyber threat

480
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,720
alliance in which case

481
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,199
in an industry specific collaboration

482
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:55,760
fusion

483
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,560
model it is absolutely awesome it is

484
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,120
excellent

485
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,320
and excels when only one industry is

486
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,199
at play however when you try to mulch

487
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,320
multiple industries

488
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,519
based on the cultures and industry silos

489
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,120
this model becomes a little bit more

490
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,600
challenging and more problem-solving

491
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,800
because it's really difficult to

492
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,160
figure out what is the right value

493
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,240
proposition and it's really difficult to

494
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,680
manage the flow of data

495
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,160
in a manner that is consistent with each

496
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,680
industry's norms

497
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,440
therefore many of the attempts to do

498
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,199
this

499
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,959
my personal opinion many attempts to do

500
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,800
this across multiple industries and a

501
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,920
global scale

502
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,240
have struggled significantly to get all

503
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,199
the right players

504
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,360
actually needed to combat a threat into

505
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,240
the same room

506
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,079
onto the same conversation and sharing

507
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,399
data transparently across each other

508
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,880
it is just a bridge too far to get there

509
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,160
at any sort of routine

510
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,040
pace and basis so these two

511
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,399
collaboration models

512
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,639
they exist but but they're not efficient

513
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,920
enough for the threat that we're trying

514
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,040
to combat

515
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,320
and then the last thing i want to talk

516
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,800
about today uh in terms of

517
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,600
hurdles to success is geography because

518
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,240
this is

519
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,160
often overlooked but i think it is

520
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,000
absolutely pivotal

521
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,560
to figuring out how do we work better

522
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,680
across industry

523
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,600
and with law enforcement as a whole and

524
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,440
i'm focusing strictly on the united

525
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,279
states but this could simply be applied

526
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:17,600
to

527
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,320
global models as well when we look at

528
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,639
how

529
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,600
the technology sector is currently

530
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,680
geographically located and positioned

531
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,680
they're largely on the west coast so

532
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,720
therefore

533
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,800
should they identify a bad guy in their

534
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,720
holdings on their platform and they want

535
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,480
to nominate that and volunteer that

536
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,160
information to law enforcement

537
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,240
that data typically ends up with local

538
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,519
law enforcement

539
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,480
agencies on the west coast conversely

540
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,320
the finance sector is very heavy in new

541
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,040
york

542
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
washington d.c and texas and if they

543
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,800
refer data it ends up in one of those

544
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,759
three cities

545
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,759
and then the cyber security industry

546
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,920
finds itself in multiple cities as well

547
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,560
new york

548
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,759
dc a little bit outside chicago

549
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,959
as well as over in california

550
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,839
on the west coast so if we need all

551
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,280
three of the players all three of the

552
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,039
industries to work together

553
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,199
having our data referred to multiple

554
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,799
different law enforcement agencies in

555
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,799
multiple different locations

556
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,640
isn't an efficient way of getting after

557
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,720
the problem and what we've seen time and

558
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,480
time again over the last four or five

559
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,359
years

560
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,319
is that this approach right here most

561
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,480
often leads to the same actor

562
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,160
being referred by the technology

563
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,919
companies by the banking company and by

564
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,440
the cyber security company

565
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,280
but it's landed in 15 different law

566
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,720
enforcement agencies

567
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,799
who aren't able to figure out one that

568
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,919
the data exists

569
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,520
and then two how to collaborate and

570
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,039
share that data because it was shared in

571
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,160
confidence or under

572
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,720
ndas or under various other sharing

573
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,400
platforms that are in place

574
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,360
so figuring out how to merge the three

575
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,039
silos together

576
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,120
um get them to work together in a

577
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,360
collaboration model that is efficient

578
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,039
and referring data to the same law

579
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,200
enforcement agency is really the crux of

580
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,440
the problem that we're trying to solve

581
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,280
as we move forward trying to combat this

582
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,200
threat

583
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,559
to get there here's the new model that

584
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,919
we are attempting it is a lot of

585
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,840
long hard thought and challenges and

586
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,600
growing pains to get here

587
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,480
and while it may seem simple and after

588
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,000
thought it definitely wasn't a

589
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,160
simple thought when we first flushed out

590
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,760
and tried to get after it

591
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,039
so the first thing i want to talk about

592
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,520
is leadership because of culture because

593
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,600
of regulation because of visibility

594
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,120
and because most importantly of our

595
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,360
vested interest cyber security entry

596
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,960
cares about our customers we want to

597
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,080
protect our customers

598
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,919
removing bad guys that are sending

599
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,080
malware helps us protect our customers

600
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,600
that's our vested interest

601
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,760
the cyber security industry as a whole

602
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,360
is best postured to serve

603
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,039
in a leadership role to combat this

604
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,679
threat and other cyber threats

605
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,520
in the past we have sat back and taken a

606
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,120
very passive approach

607
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,799
we've said that we're going to wait for

608
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,640
law enforcement to send us a subpoena or

609
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,320
an inquiry and then we'll simply respond

610
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,360
when asked

611
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,760
but that model has not seen success so

612
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,440
we need to take a more proactive

613
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,200
approach and we would argue for a more

614
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,799
proactive approach

615
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,640
as we all become leaders in the cyber

616
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,880
security space

617
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,120
taking that leadership approach one of

618
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,880
our first pilot efforts

619
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,039
um an effort that we're currently

620
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,880
actively pursuing

621
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,320
is one of a flexible collaboration model

622
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,960
and how this works and how we flushed it

623
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,679
out

624
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,760
is that we start as a cyber security

625
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,280
company palo alto networks

626
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,679
will identify a bad actor we will build

627
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,600
a complete dossier on this bad actor we

628
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,559
will

629
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,960
compile combine all the hashes that we

630
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,679
know for this act

631
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,840
all the malware samples all the c2

632
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,720
domains

633
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,400
all of the email addresses across all

634
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,880
the tech platforms that that may be at

635
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,600
play

636
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,640
and any sort of financial losses that we

637
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,160
may know about so we know which banks to

638
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,000
coordinate with

639
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,480
we will then share that packet with our

640
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,120
partners

641
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,160
we will not share it with law

642
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,679
enforcement we will share with partners

643
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,480
and this is

644
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,360
very very um key to the collaboration

645
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,120
success of the the problem

646
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,720
you have to share it with your partners

647
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,120
first in order for them to be able to do

648
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,000
a joint referral

649
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,240
process if you give the data directly to

650
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,840
law enforcement and there's an active

651
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,280
law enforcement case

652
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,280
then most organizations cannot refer

653
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,039
their data after there's an active law

654
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,640
enforcement case they have to wait for

655
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,720
subpoena and that slows things down

656
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,240
so ideally you want to work with your

657
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,480
partners up front and socialize your

658
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,320
packet beforehand

659
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,159
the way we go about it is we make a

660
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,679
value proposition for each one of the

661
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,960
partners that we want to

662
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,200
collaborate with and what that sounds

663
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,039
like is essentially

664
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,280
dear partner we will give you our packet

665
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,960
for free

666
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,880
it comes with all the accounts on your

667
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,720
platform that were built by the bad

668
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,440
actor

669
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,280
and we will also give you all the other

670
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,960
accounts that we are tracking that may

671
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,880
be victims on your platform

672
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,559
to show that there is badness taking

673
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,080
place by an actor who's abusing your

674
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,799
policy

675
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,799
who is then targeting other actors on

676
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,240
your platform

677
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,400
that gives a value proposition to the

678
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,159
tech company or to the social media

679
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,679
company to have a vested interest in

680
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,200
pursuing this case

681
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,799
we do a similar type thing with the

682
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,360
banking industry as well

683
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,600
the only thing that we ask in return for

684
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,520
providing all this free data to the

685
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,880
industry

686
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
to the tech industry is that when they

687
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,320
do their investigation

688
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,640
we ask that they refer the data to the

689
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,520
law enforcement

690
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,000
office and organization of our choosing

691
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,840
so rather than a tech industry referring

692
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,120
it to california and us

693
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,600
referring it to new york we are driving

694
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,440
all of the referrals to the same law

695
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,960
enforcement organization same law

696
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,640
enforcement office same law enforcement

697
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,440
agent

698
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,960
to ensure that they don't have to go

699
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,799
piecemeal across various law enforcement

700
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,679
organizations

701
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,360
the data that's coming in from multiple

702
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,799
companies

703
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,320
doing so has created a tremendous

704
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,879
efficiency

705
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,880
once we've done that we then take a step

706
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,440
back

707
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,679
and we've decided that rather than doing

708
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,640
a one-off

709
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,320
we should try and build momentum and

710
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,559
build some efficiencies of scale

711
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,360
so instead of just stopping there after

712
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,120
the first actor has been referred

713
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,960
we look for another actor that is

714
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,799
loosely related either based on

715
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,120
infrastructure or social media

716
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,799
linkages between them with the original

717
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,600
referral this allows us to significantly

718
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,039
reduce the legal review

719
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,440
across all of the industry partners and

720
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,559
law enforcement

721
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,960
because it changes that conversation

722
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,760
from

723
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,320
let me tell you about a new bad actor

724
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,039
two

725
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,039
let me talk to you about another actor

726
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,480
associated with that case that you

727
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,000
already approved

728
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,440
and let me talk to you about the group

729
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,799
of actors that we've been talking about

730
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,240
for the last few weeks and here's

731
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,679
another guy that's in that group that

732
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:32,880
we've talked about

733
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,640
so we're really improving efficiencies

734
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,880
across legal review process

735
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,960
internal to cyber security companies

736
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,120
internal tech companies internal banks

737
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,400
internal to law enforcement because

738
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:44,880
we're

739
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,640
creating a tail that just continues to

740
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,039
grow on itself

741
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,080
what that looks like at scale so far

742
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,880
this year is over the last nine months

743
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,840
we have referred

744
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,200
jointly a total of nine packets

745
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,720
associated with the actors that you see

746
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,480
here on the chart in front of you

747
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,799
the box in blue is the actors that we're

748
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,039
currently working on with four partners

749
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,799
we are open to working with more if

750
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,159
anyone is interested in joining we're

751
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,240
happy to share our telemetry uh we view

752
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,000
this as being a team sport and a team

753
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,360
effort

754
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,400
and we're happy to share that through

755
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,000
the cyber threat alliance and any of

756
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,840
those collaboration platforms that you

757
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,880
prefer

758
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,720
but this model has allowed us to start

759
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,559
with one actor at the top

760
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,480
in which we had seven partners all refer

761
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,320
data on that individual

762
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,159
and then spider web out following the

763
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,320
red lines to other actors that are

764
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,760
associated with them

765
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,159
so that rather than having 25 disparate

766
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,200
cases being run

767
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,720
in 25 different law enforcement

768
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,360
jurisdictions we have one jurisdiction

769
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,720
getting all the data from all the

770
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,559
partners

771
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,200
from a value proposition standpoint i

772
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,640
would say that this has been absolutely

773
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,480
phenomenal from a cyber security

774
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,440
lens but starting with law enforcement

775
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,320
angle

776
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,159
law enforcement is now receiving the

777
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,320
right data at the right time

778
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,240
and what i mean in terms of right data

779
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,159
is rather than trying to fumble through

780
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,159
a case and figuring out a hundred email

781
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,720
addresses that a bad guy has registered

782
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,400
the tech companies are providing the

783
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
list of 100 email addresses through a

784
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,480
free referral to law enforcement

785
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,679
saying here are the hundred email

786
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,919
addresses send us a subpoena on these

787
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:16,480
three

788
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,039
don't worry about the other 97 because

789
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,320
they were stood up for two domain

790
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,080
registrations and that's it

791
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,679
and that allows law enforcement to focus

792
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,600
their time and energy on something of

793
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,400
value

794
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
place chasing dead ends and loose

795
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,760
threads uh

796
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,919
through completion so we're creating

797
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,440
quite a bit of efficiencies from a law

798
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,799
enforcement standpoint

799
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,360
in terms of a tech sector standpoint

800
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,159
we're on

801
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,159
unearthing and unmasking the tip of an

802
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,000
iceberg that is typically allowing them

803
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,960
to identify

804
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,880
massive amounts of badness taking place

805
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,720
on their platforms

806
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,559
at a rapid scale and providing them with

807
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,000
all the evidence they need to take

808
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,279
action on it

809
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,279
by starting internal investigations and

810
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,960
trying to spite a web outwards

811
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,880
we can tell them as they find new email

812
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,240
addresses and new

813
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,840
skype accounts we can tell them that oh

814
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,520
that's this other bad guy will give you

815
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,279
a packet on that other bad guy

816
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,720
and that helps that case continue to

817
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,799
flow internal to the tech company

818
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,960
and then from the cyber security lens

819
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,640
we're receiving additional selectors

820
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,240
back from this process and additional

821
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,760
domains back from this process that we

822
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,000
may

823
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,120
not have known about other

824
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,400
infrastructure we may not have known

825
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,039
about

826
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,480
that allows us to continue building

827
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,320
protections for our customers

828
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,760
so all things being equal this is

829
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,320
provide a tremendous amount of value for

830
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,720
all of the players involved and we would

831
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,559
open that up to anyone else who wants to

832
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,120
participate

833
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,720
given this model and its success um

834
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,559
we're cutting time we're cutting energy

835
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,000
while producing enhanced value for all

836
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,320
the partners we hope that this has been

837
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:40,559
a

838
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,799
valuable 30 minutes of your time if

839
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,799
there's any questions or concerns about

840
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,000
the model and the approach that we're

841
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,760
following or any interest in joining the

842
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,400
effort
