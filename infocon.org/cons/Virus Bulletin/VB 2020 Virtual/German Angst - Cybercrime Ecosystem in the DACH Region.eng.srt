almost 15 years

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,920

more insight about how these

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,239
cybercriminals evolved and adapted to

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,399
several well things happening out there

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,840
like

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,760
influence from the russian-speaking

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,039
cyber criminals

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,600
or english or other international cyber

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,800
crime

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,399
organized gangs we are aware of

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,119
today i'm presenting this or offering

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,400
this talk to you

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,000
because the ecosystem in the dark region

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,439
differs very very very much from

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,040
what we are known or know about today's

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,080
structure uh from eastern europe or

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,200
other international speaking forums

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,080
um the origins and today's structure of

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,799
cyber criminals they the careers started

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,960
very early in the early times of cargo

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,759
planet shadow crew or dark market

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,320
some of you may aware or heard of these

38
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,759
these forums in the past

39
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,759
these are forums from the beginning of

40
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,520
the new millennia

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,079
and these been international speaking

42
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,479
forums mostly led by

43
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,200
eastern european gangs or criminals and

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,920
some of them also also english speaking

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,000
and the origins of these professional

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,079
german language cybercrimes were

47
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,759
goes back to this time it's a period

48
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,560
from 2000 to 2008

49
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,759
and the first split of of or split

50
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,799
from the international community to

51
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,959
some native speaking on german native

52
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,318
speaking forums

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,520
has been with the tech sector

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,879
and through the following 20 25 minutes

55
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,920
i will

56
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,480
walk you through all the different

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,599
forums which well appeared evolved and

58
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,879
disappeared

59
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,599
during the past 15 years in the dark

60
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,040
region

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,599
going from hex sector to today's crime

62
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,560
network

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,080
and even telling you that

64
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,519
well some people tried to create their

65
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,560
own well cybercrime

66
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,840
forums for their own culture so

67
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,160
people from bosnia or croatia macedonia

68
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,879
montenegro

69
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,319
serbia or slovenia they tried to run

70
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,519
their own forums like comlink and fatal

71
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,000
just to bring their own people there and

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,720
to

73
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,519
give real-life criminals from the mafia

74
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,720
a chance to

75
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,040
contact their business also in a digital

76
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,560
way

77
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,080
they failed because of their upset

78
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,640
so they use their real-life names to

79
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,040
create their the alias on the forum

80
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,760
they use their real-life ids and

81
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,560
documents to register the forums

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,680
with a hoster and domain registrator

83
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,599
so you are you can imagine how easily

84
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,200
or easy it's been for law enforcement to

85
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,000
find the people behind these forums and

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,400
well

87
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,400
take the infrastructure off

88
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,159
and with the structure and the origins

89
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,879
of the forums of

90
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,000
dark region also the payment methods

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,440
evolved in a different way than we are

92
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,799
aware of

93
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,599
from eastern european you know forums so

94
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,959
it all started with

95
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,360
with vouchers who were able to buy from

96
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,239
the gas station

97
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,519
the pharmacy or a normal grocery store

98
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,720
pay safe card or you cash and these been

99
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,840
vouchers well

100
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,760
you took your cash to the counter the

101
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,360
gas station and you got a voucher with a

102
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,480
number on it

103
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,640
it's been worth well the amount you put

104
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,040
on the on the cash counter

105
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,680
so there's been no kyc or any

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,959
verification

107
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,800
if you had enough money you were able to

108
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,400
to buy these these vouchers

109
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,160
for five hundred thousand dollars two

110
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,040
thousand dollars um no problem

111
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,120
and what they did is um where they

112
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,840
bought their credit card or they

113
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,080
they're the digital goods or they this

114
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,840
the carded iphone

115
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,880
um on the forum paid with pay safeguard

116
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,800
the vendor or the user selling this

117
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,919
product

118
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,520
um took the voucher number and

119
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,240
well reloaded with the voucher number

120
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,040
so-called

121
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,360
prepaid debit card this time there has

122
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,240
been

123
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,000
some prepaid debit cards we were able to

124
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,680
load with pay safeguard and new cash and

125
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,080
then just go to the atm

126
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,280
and cash out the money again no kyc

127
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,560
or something similar um no anti-fraud

128
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,520
mechanism like

129
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,720
like we know it today they

130
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,080
adapted and went really fast also to

131
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,280
liberty reserve some of you may have

132
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,759
heard

133
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,479
known read about liberty reserve in the

134
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,320
past and um

135
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,280
the first time web money has been well

136
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,880
introduced to the german-speaking

137
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,000
ecosystem

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,960
um it's because of well german cyber

139
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,479
criminals with

140
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,800
russian or eastern european roots were

141
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,840
aware of of web money and tried to

142
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,720
start their business with this currency

143
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,520
but

144
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,560
for a long time for a long period um

145
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,120
they still stayed with liberty reserve

146
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,479
until it's been shut down by the

147
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,759
by a u.s law enforcement so they started

148
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,720
to

149
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,520
to send um cash by mail stuffed in a

150
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,240
book or in a teddy bear

151
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,000
and sent by well by mail and

152
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,560
they had to wait several days until the

153
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,680
stuffed teddy bear with

154
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,639
some hundred euros uh has been received

155
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,720
by by the vendor and then he did send

156
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,039
his

157
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,479
is good um to the the buyer

158
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,639
um they did a lot of money graham and

159
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,520
western union transfers it's been due to

160
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,720
high quality fake ids german fake ids

161
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,000
in this this time period but um

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,479
today and since 2006

163
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,840
um bitcoin is has been the number one

164
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,400
uh cryptocurrency and currency for

165
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,240
german speaking cyber criminals

166
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,759
uh and now since 2020 or

167
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,080
2019 um some of them

168
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,560
or a lot of them are now switching to

169
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,599
monero

170
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,120
it's just because they've been aware

171
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,440
that law enforcement was able to track

172
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,479

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,920
the state criminal investigations

career and his case exposed happened

259
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,760
because

260
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,240
of a journalist from a german-speaking

261
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,000
really small

262
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,440
news channel did some research

263
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,959
and well confronted the

264
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,279
fbi with his research and so they had to

265
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,360
rush up the the sting operation and rate

266
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,399
everything

267
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,600
but what happened to marcus is that

268
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,360
in iceland the doorbell rang in the

269
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,200
morning shortly afterwards and

270
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,839
yeah i stood in front of the door

271
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,839
definitely not dhl

272
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,320
bing dong and the police the german

273
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,440
police

274
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,040
waiting for marcus but marcus has been

275
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,880
surprisingly tough the young swabian

276
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,640
asked to be allowed to put something on

277
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,000
quickly

278
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,760
so in his room he managed to switch off

279
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,320
the running computer in matrix or aka

280
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
marcus had highly encrypted the hard

281
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,120

282
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,440
his password had 64 characters and the

283
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,200
computer failed as evidenced

284
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,040

the origin of the origin of the of the

344
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,079
stolen cards has been hack shops

345
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,240
databases and phishing

346
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,360
in the past um the

347
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,959
credit cards has been stored on

348
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,279
infrastructure and

349
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,720
in plain text so the database has been

350
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,680
not so encrypted as it is today not so

351
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,199
highly secured

352
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,320

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,560
even the numbers from the customers

354
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,560
they've been stored in plain text and

355
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,399
yeah you can imagine

356
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,399
how easy it's been for the criminals to

357
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,320
access them and to resell them on the

358
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,000

363
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,040

364
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,720

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,760
and this business was going very well

515
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,280
the main source of income were fake

516
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,000
shops

517
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,559
within italy with a monthly turnover of

518
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,760
almost 600

519
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,360
000 and here you see

520
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,799
one of the two in front or at the card

521
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,240
in front of the judge

522
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,720
convicted because of distributing child

523
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,799
pornography

524
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,360
and last but not least there's been also

525
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,960
dark market seo

526
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,799
it's a little known and it's been a

527
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,240
little bit different than the other

528
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,200
communities

529
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,760
and a little unknown who the

530
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,840
administrators were

531
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,480
because there were some users who worked

532
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,960
and acted like an admin

533
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,640
but from how the forum has been

534
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,720
structured and organized

535
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,080
so professional as that has been

536
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,400
the admins and moderators they've been

537
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,240
really let's say

538
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,120
acted script kitty like so it seems like

539
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,600
there were

540
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,320
other people the real people stayed back

541
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,600
in the background

542
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,480
and that other doing their work um

543
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,240
highly specialized and fake ideas and

544
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,440
payment fraud

545
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,640
again with credit cards a famous

546
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,360
user called symbios gave away credit

547
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,720
cards for free

548
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,120
with a limit on five or ten thousand

549
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,720
euro on a daily basis so you got a

550
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,240
credit card for free and we were able to

551
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,440
buy

552
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,360
stuff in goods worth five thousand euros

553
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,240
and the users who use these credit cards

554
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,960
they made well proof pictures of the

555
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,559
goods they received

556
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,559
and put them on the forum with the guys

557
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,320
taking like thank you symbiotes for all

558
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,640
the

559
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,880
free money and the free stuff we ordered

560
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,400
with your credit cards

561
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,000
they were the best fake ids from germany

562
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,760
available which even worked in

563
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,240
banking banks in store in the banks and

564
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,200
bypassed

565
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,919
even federal printing office scanners

566
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:56,559
because

567
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,320
here supply chains were compromised in

568
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,559
order to obtain the raw material

569
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,440
to create these fake ids what happened

570
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,120
with dark market is that from one day to

571
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,520
the next

572
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,720
forum disappeared and till today it is

573
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,360
unknown

574
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,600
to me and other threat researchers what

575
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,639
happened there

576
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,720
which will lead us and bring us to some

577
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,000
well sad and different

578
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,320
part of the german-speaking underground

579
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,960
economy deutschland and deepwhip didw

580
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,000
deutschland in deepweb or gidw has been

581
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,480
the first

582
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,760
german-speaking underground community on

583
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,000
the tor web

584
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,960
so this forum has been accessible only

585
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,440
via the tor browser

586
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,960
and you read it here in terms of content

587
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,760
everything is allowed spam and fraud

588
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,320
were tolerated

589
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,480
but child pornography has been the only

590
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,400
thing that's been banned on this

591
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,840
community

592
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,880
now to this day child pornography has

593
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,720
been the only thing

594
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,039
banned on cybercrime underground

595
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,280
everything else has been allowed

596
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,880
explosives weapon terrorism

597
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,880
there's been no limits i only tried

598
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,400
pornography

599
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,280
it's been this this thing that no other

600
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,320
forum allowed and

601
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,159
even on didw what happened on the idw

602
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,840
is that with 23 000 active users

603
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,400
6 million page views per month led and

604
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,600
run by lucky specs aka alexander you

605
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,679
this forum is a sad story of a negative

606
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,320
impact on the underground economy

607
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,520
because on july the 22nd 2016 there was

608
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,640
a rampage and mass

609
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,039
shooting at the olympia shopping mall in

610
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,799
munich

611
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,600
and the 18 year old shot nine people and

612
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,000
then

613
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,640
himself and the weapon he purchased

614
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,640
through a vendor on the platform didw

615
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,000
you can imagine that no expense and no

616
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,640
effort

617
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,960
was spared to take dw offline by law

618
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,480
enforcement agents and they took it

619
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,440
offline

620
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,000
the investigators they investigated so

621
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,679
long and so hard that they

622
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,039
have taken over a moderator account and

623
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,400
with this moderator account they

624
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,159
involved the administrator

625
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,400
in a conversation and told him that his

626
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,320
infrastructure is not secure

627
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,600
and he should look into it and he did

628
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,200
at the same time his apartment was

629
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,799
raided so that he could not encrypt his

630
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,880
computer in time

631
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,200
he was legally sentenced to six years

632
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,120
imprisonment for running a cyber crime

633
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,240
platform

634
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,000
the arms dealer was sentenced to seven

635
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,840
years imprisonment for accessory to

636
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,120
murder

637
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,840
unto this day there were only two bands

638
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,559
in the german-speaking underground

639
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,640
these were child pornography and

640
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,840
terrorism

641
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,840
this has now been expanded to include

642
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,520
any kinds of weapons trafficking

643
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,039
and until today stay so no terrorism no

644
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,080
child pornography

645
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,480
no weapons no explosives since 2016

646
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,640

underground

649
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,120
economy this is him in front of a judge

650
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,159
and bring us to the final destination

651
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,919
