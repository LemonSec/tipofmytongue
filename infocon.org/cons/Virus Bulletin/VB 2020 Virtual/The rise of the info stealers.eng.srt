1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,840
the rise of info steelers

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,679
my name is shayal fassi i'm a cyber

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,440
security researcher at risen cyber

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,320
security

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,560
and i'm donna i'm a security researcher

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,840
also in this team

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,400
and reason cyber security is focusing on

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,320
end-to-end protection

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,560
talk outline what we are going to speak

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,400
about in this lecture

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,560
so we are going to speak about

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,479
infrastructure malware we are going to

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,880
really uh speak about what it is we are

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,559
going to speak also about the key

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,600
differences between

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,559
rat and infostator and we also going to

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:40,879
see

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,040
the evolution of infostater and how it

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,000
was evolved over

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,079
the last years the definition of

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,280
infostillers

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,840
what is that basically infostiller is

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,520
information stealer it's a type of

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,160
malware

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,079
that is designed to collect information

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,399
from a remote host

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,879
so what does an infrastructure actually

28
00:00:58,879 --> 00:00:59,920
steal

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,199
basically every access that it can

30
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,159
so on the day-to-day we are using many

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,360
many apps and many

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,439
platforms different platforms for

33
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,560
example facebook

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,600
whatsapp dropbox and other

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,560
infostater are focused on two things the

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,280
first one

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,880
is of course getting the information

38
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,560
from your browser and getting all the

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,040
data

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,439
so it can access those platforms and

41
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,320
secondary

42
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,119
it's actually the file system itself so

43
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,640
it means that the infostiller

44
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,280
has two sides the first stage of it is

45
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,479
the browser mugging

46
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,560
as we can see on the right picture we

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,680
can see a process

48
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,720
of a new enumeration process that the

49
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,759
malware is doing

50
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,320
to actually find out which browser that

51
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,360
computer have

52
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,479
and if it found some browser so it

53
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,360
actually goes

54
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,200
and try to see if it can steal some

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,759
information from the files

56
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,720
so what does actually browser mugging is

57
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,479
the infostator is focusing on a few

58
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:56,960
things

59
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,079
it focused on saved password that stays

60
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,479
and saved on our browser it focused on

61
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,200
save

62
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,040
credit cards information cookies and

63
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,560
sessions email addresses

64
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,199
username phone numbers first name and

65
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,000
last name

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,319
and all the information that is saved on

67
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,879
different forms that we filled out

68
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,599
most of the time as users we don't like

69
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,360
to put our credentials

70
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,440
all the time we don't like to type in we

71
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,640
like to give

72
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,599
the browser the ability to remember and

73
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,160
save our credentials so we can go faster

74
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,920
and work faster with the browser

75
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,319
and it happens when you actually want to

76
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,760
fill out some form

77
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,959
register form maybe to sign up or log in

78
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,920
to some platform or some website so

79
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,120
always the browser will

80
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,840
actually try to ask us if we want to use

81
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,560
the save credentials that we have

82
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,680
next is basically the file system the

83
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,400
file system

84
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,879
focused on things that happens on the

85
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,239
file system itself

86
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,239
and not the browser so on the right

87
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,400
picture here we can actually see

88
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,440
that we have an enumeration process of

89
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,400
cryptocurrency wallets such as electrum

90
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,200
ethereum

91
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,400
and other also we are looking for

92
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,319
screenshots cryptocurrency wallets as we

93
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:10,959
see

94
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,920
system information steam accounts saved

95
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,560
password

96
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,680
geolocation and raising documents

97
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,840
now infostealers are actually today

98
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,959
looking for more

99
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,800
recent documents and it's very very

100
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,480
interesting for them because

101
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,959
if the user have some important files

102
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,319
that it

103
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,599
uses on daily basis so maybe it could be

104
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,400
it could have some value for the

105
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,760
attacker itself

106
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,360
so the attacker can take this

107
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,599
information and find out exactly what it

108
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,400
is

109
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,080
and more than that the information

110
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,920
stealer could actually

111
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,319
use all of those files and all of those

112
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,920
credentials that it collects

113
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,480
in order to actually elevate the attack

114
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,400
itself to something which is much more

115
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,200
bigger

116
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,360
so as we see right here we can

117
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,200
understand what exactly infrastructure

118
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,599
is

119
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,640
and what it go after so we saw it was

120
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,599
split into

121
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,879
browsers and also for file system

122
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,799
but let's really understand exactly how

123
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,239
it operates and what

124
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,080
are the key differences between an

125
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,360
infrastructure to

126
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,799
a rat as shai said

127
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,238
the infostiller comes to steal

128
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,478
information so we see it more as a quick

129
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,160
attack where the malware reads the

130
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,918
sensitive files and sends them back to

131
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:22,880
the attacker

132
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,400
sometimes without the user even

133
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,320
realizing it was compromised

134
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,840
let's take for example the lacun

135
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,479
infostiller it remained undetected for a

136
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,919
whole month but not because

137
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,240
it did some extraordinary av evasion

138
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,960
techniques

139
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,360
but because it kept its infrastructure

140
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,440
dynamic and innocent looking

141
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,680
deracune would send a request to google

142
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,040
docs or to github

143
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,720
and from the response it would parse the

144
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,400
ip address

145
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,880
to realize the iq to send the data to we

146
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,720
want to emphasize why we see

147
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,120
more infostatus distribution instead of

148
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,199
rat distribution

149
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,880
so for one the very lack of an

150
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,400
installation process

151
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,039
or persistence or firewall changes or

152
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,360
any other typical malicious changes to

153
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,600
the system all of those are potential

154
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,560
iocs

155
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,280
or triggers for av detection and when we

156
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,320
look at prices

157
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,479
of buying a rat as a service or buying

158
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,160
an infrastilla as a service

159
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,840
we can see that there is an additional

160
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,759
price for every new compilation

161
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,000
so when you take out the amount of iocs

162
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,680
that needs to be changed every time the

163
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,720
malware is caught

164
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,560
you reduce the price significantly

165
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,440
also if you're operating this alone it

166
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,800
means less effort for you

167
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,840
and less changes to the code

168
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,759
on the right we can see how it is

169
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,039
reflected in reality

170
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,639
when we look on the metro and attack

171
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,720
charts we can see that the less cubes

172
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,560
marked means the less suspicious and

173
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,639
less eye-catching the malware is

174
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,479
additional benefits are the immediate

175
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,639
access to the sensitive data

176
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,840
one can have access to someone else's

177
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,000
wallet

178
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,639
immediately instead of just waiting for

179
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,039
the

180
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,600
mining activity to get beneficial enough

181
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,280
also you don't have to wait for the

182
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,039
specific time the user will log on to

183
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,319
the specific site

184
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,880
in order to get the passwords and maybe

185
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,440
are more

186
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,280
philosophical point of view is the

187
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,639
severity of the actions

188
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,600
stealing passwords might feel less

189
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,840
visually threatening than a ransomware

190
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,240
and doing it might feel less damaging

191
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,800
for the moral attackers between us

192
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,440
those details are later sold for example

193
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,360
one credit card can reach the price

194
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,600
of five dollars up to thirty dollars

195
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,960
really depending on the amount of

196
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,479
personal information include

197
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,280
included for example the geolocation of

198
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,520
a credit card owner from switzerland

199
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,759
is worth way more than the one from

200
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,960
egypt

201
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,800
besides gaining free access to the

202
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,000
sensitive data

203
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,319
a more disturbing manner is of espionage

204
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,280
reconnaissance

205
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,199
and getting further access to even more

206
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,199
sensitive accounts or environments

207
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,720
that may have not been stored on the

208
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,199
system while the attack occurred

209
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,280
while some malware check the geolocation

210
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,240
some also

211
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
check the network name in order to

212
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,160
derive the company name or just to steal

213
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,199
wi-fi passwords

214
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,039
think of how many sites require you for

215
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,639
two-factor authentication

216
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,800
and how many not and how many regular

217
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,720
users are actually bothering themselves

218
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,160
to apply those

219
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,199
protection mechanisms so gaining access

220
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,880
to those credential

221
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,280
may gain access to the vpn of a bridged

222
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,160
employee

223
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,479
to zoom accounts or private github

224
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,160
projects or competitors

225
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
or just credential staffing let's move

226
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,919
on to some visual examples

227
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,680
this is an example of a javascript

228
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,599
infosteerer that we analyzed

229
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,599
and we can see how it is activating the

230
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,520
functions of credential stealing

231
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,160
it steals from filezilla servers and

232
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,759
then decrypting the password

233
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,520
after the data is stolen it is being

234
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,960
sent to the attacker

235
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,440
one of the most common ways we saw is of

236
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,120
composing an email message

237
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,960
with the address of the attacker and the

238
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,240
body contents are the

239
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,720
stolen credentials sometimes it is even

240
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,280
encrypted to avoid further detection

241
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,599
also our malware love to stay under the

242
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,879
radar

243
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,240
and they are achieving this goal by

244
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,400
using a whitelisted services

245
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,800
such as google docs github twitter

246
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,520
remote mysql and so on

247
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,360
that way the infrastructure remains

248
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
undetected for longer and it is also

249
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,560
harder to block

250
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,319
so the data can be exfiltrated

251
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,000
successfully so when you

252
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,720
hear of passwords being stolen from web

253
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,599
browsers

254
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,360
uh this is where the action actually

255
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,599
happens uh this is the

256
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,759
google home visual data default folder

257
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,520
and it contains many sensitive files

258
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,400
such as cookies history and login data

259
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,560
the login data file contains all the

260
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,440
passwords

261
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,559
and similar files also exist

262
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,039
for the rest of the browsers such as

263
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,240
firefox opera

264
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,919
thunderbird and even email accounts or

265
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,679
cryptocurrency wallets or amazon

266
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,399
credentials

267
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,440
also can be stolen from the station

268
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,680
so this is how the login data file looks

269
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,560
like when you open it in the sql browser

270
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,680
and we can see that the login site and

271
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,440
the username are stored

272
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,839
in clear text while the password is

273
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,560
stored as an

274
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,200
encrypted blob this is the same

275
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
javascript from before but this time

276
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,720
those are the functions to decrypt the

277
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,200
password in order to get the plain text

278
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,000
password we

279
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,080
use the krypton protect data api

280
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,959
imported from crypt 32 dll

281
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,360
um if you ever were physically in front

282
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,200
of your browser and try to look at your

283
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,000
passwords

284
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,480
you know that the the browser ask you

285
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,120
for

286
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,839
for your windows credential but in code

287
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,279
it's not needed

288
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,200
this is a short python code that does

289
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,560
exactly that

290
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,080
we we read the login data file and query

291
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,080
and execute an sql query

292
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,320
we are querying for the site username

293
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,680
and password

294
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,720
and for each result we iterate and

295
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,360
uh and apply our password decryption

296
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,320
routine

297
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
you can see that there are two options

298
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,760
here and that that is because

299
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,880
in older versions of chrome uh

300
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,040
one call to the crit unprotect data api

301
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,240
function was enough

302
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,160
but in newer version we also need to

303
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,440
have the master key

304
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,519
but fear not it's only like five lines

305
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,720
of code

306
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,279
so to derive the maester key we read the

307
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,120
local state file located in the same

308
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,360
folder as the login data file

309
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,079
and then we derived the master key from

310
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,720
a base64 encoded encrypted key

311
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
and applied the same cryptonprotectdata

312
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,200
api function

313
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,480
then we use it to generate an aes cipher

314
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,200
and uh and an iv that was stored

315
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,399
alongside with the

316
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,440
with the password blob and we have the

317
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,680
password

318
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,760
so what happens with all of the stolen

319
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,880
data after all of this journey

320
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,120
we can see that we can sell a swedish

321
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,320
passport for

322
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,800
four thousand dollars and all of the

323
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,040
gaming and email and other accounts that

324
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,760
we

325
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,320
talked about are sold for single dollars

326
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,839
and um

327
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,240
paying methods are also well paid for

328
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,320
for example you can see at the top chart

329
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,519
that bank details can be sold for 250

330
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,920
as long as you have a minimum balance of

331
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,279
at least

332
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,920
two thousand dollars and uh paypal is

333
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,160
also interesting because you can pay for

334
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,959
only

335
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,720
only the login credentials or you can

336
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,240
also pay for the trans

337
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,320
transaction itself of the transformation

338
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,160
of money

339
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,560
and this is another example of selling a

340
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,800
bunch of italian email addresses for two

341
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,760
dollars

342
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,959
and another example of selling uh

343
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,920
um a pack of spotify netflix and hulu

344
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,760
accounts also for two dollars

345
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,440
so when you sell them over and over

346
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,959
again you can gain

347
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,480
a lot of money and that's basic cycle

348
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,839
of stealing user information

349
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,040
great so after understanding really how

350
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
it operates and how infrastructures are

351
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,480
actually working

352
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,279
from the technical side let's understand

353
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,079
what happened

354
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,880
and how it works about the evolution of

355
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,839
the infrastructures

356
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,639
itself so we will start with a familiar

357
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,440
infostealer

358
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,320
that was out there since 2016 which

359
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,680
called azeroth

360
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,560
azeroth it's very basic infostealer

361
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,399
which of course was first seen again

362
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,200
in 2016. the main purpose it was to

363
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,959
steal browsing history cookies

364
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,839
passwords credit card information

365
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,480
cryptocurrency and of course

366
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,040
system information it was sold on

367
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,800
russian underground forms

368
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,920
and today we also see it being used by

369
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,720
attackers

370
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,560
the last time that we came across the

371
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,920
azeroth it was

372
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,480
on our last threat research on the kovi

373
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,560
19 the map of threats

374
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,639
so what happened over there it was

375
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,920
actually that

376
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,320
the mallards of the attackers were

377
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,600
disguised the malware

378
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,720
the map of john hopkins so it took

379
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,480
all of the statistics of john hopkins

380
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,399
map and just what happened in the

381
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:40,959
background

382
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,800
is the malware itself the infostator

383
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,240
itself starts

384
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,040
running and the other world itself it's

385
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,639
pretty

386
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,839
easy to follow because all the code and

387
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,920
everything out there is pretty simple

388
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,639
if we take it and we reverse engineer it

389
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,160
we can see all the capabilities and

390
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,800
abilities

391
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,040
of this malware and it was pretty simple

392
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,320
to follow and see

393
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,880
that it's an infras information stealer

394
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,800
so here in the picture

395
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,279
we can find out that the malware itself

396
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,680
actually extracted the passwordless.txt

397
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,320
file

398
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,040
and took my username and my password to

399
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,680
my email

400
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,560
to my email account and below that we

401
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,720
can see that it was sent via post

402
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,000
response to the attacker itself

403
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,720
so the azeroth itself it's just a old

404
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,800
malware from 2016

405
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
that doesn't have really a lot of

406
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,839
capabilities

407
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,399
but it's very simple and it works until

408
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,120
now

409
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,920
and the idea behind azeroth is that you

410
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,720
can still

411
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,040
find it for sale in different forms and

412
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,399
you can still take it

413
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,040
and actually use it to steal information

414
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,760
as a world

415
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,959
it's a dummy malware because all of the

416
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:49,920
capabilities

417
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,800
are basically just the same and it's

418
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
basic and it's very easy to

419
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,839
catch it and flap it but when we go

420
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:58,480
further

421
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,639
there are another infrastructures like

422
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,600
for example

423
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,240
paulo now polo was first seen in august

424
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,279
10

425
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,240
and the idea behind polo is that it was

426
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,959
it used

427
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,519
adamantium thief libraries from github

428
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,639
to actually steal

429
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,959
the browser information and it was

430
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,160
sending the information

431
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,360
to remotemysql.com database so here we

432
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,000
can see

433
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,959
a file and a malware that doesn't came

434
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:23,360
with

435
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,680
the capabilities inside of the code it

436
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,399
was using

437
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,199
external resources in order to take

438
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,240
those uh

439
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,240
abilities and to apply it on the

440
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,760
workstation

441
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,920
so the idea here is that the file itself

442
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,519
the binary file itself

443
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,720
is uh uh the size of this file is

444
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,040
less than 80 kilobytes so it means that

445
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,199
an av will have a hard time to detect it

446
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,120
but not only because the file size is

447
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,240
pretty it is

448
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,360
pretty uh light it's because

449
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,880
the idea is that there are no code

450
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,600
inside the binary itself there are just

451
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,199
external resources

452
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,320
that the malware is pulling out so

453
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,800
going out next we can see another

454
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,399
influencer information stealer which is

455
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,600
pretty interesting

456
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,680
and it's and it's the zero max stealer

457
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,800
as a service

458
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,920
the idea behind xeromax is basically

459
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
that it doesn't came just as an

460
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,600
infrastructure it also

461
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,639
applies to you with a market now

462
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,199
when we are using some information

463
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:23,839
stealer

464
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,240
and we get the information itself the

465
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,399
next stage is to sell it the next stage

466
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,519
is to find out how

467
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,320
we're going to make some money of it so

468
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,399
here we have the full package we have a

469
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,519
full framework

470
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,160
so we are not just selling a zero max

471
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,639
dealer

472
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,199
we also selling for you an access to a

473
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:41,759
platform

474
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,959
which you can sell all of your stolen

475
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,839
information in this market and you can

476
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:48,880
make some money

477
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,120
the idea here is to actually motivate

478
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,399
more attackers

479
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,120
to use the xeromax infostealer because

480
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,000
they will have

481
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,399
a quick framework to sell all of the

482
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,839
things that they stole

483
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,720
so as we can see here we have actually

484
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,120
some

485
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,399
evolution of infostillers we start with

486
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,399
the azeroth which was pretty

487
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,880
easy to find and pretty dummy because it

488
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,240
did everything that it can

489
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,880
all the code came just in one pack there

490
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,160
is no usage

491
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,399
with uh obfuscation or any other

492
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,279
mechanism

493
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,120
to actually try and cover

494
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,839
the actions of this malware and next we

495
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,199
saw paolo which paolo

496
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,320
did something else it was used

497
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,199
it's used with external resources from

498
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,480
github and from

499
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,959
remote mysql and it's hard to detect

500
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,320
that by av because

501
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,040
av will take time to flag those external

502
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,720
resources and then understand

503
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,759
that this malware is actually a modeler

504
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,399
and next we saw the xeromax dealer which

505
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:48,800
was

506
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,440
very interesting because it is not just

507
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,720
an information stealer

508
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,680
it gives you and gives us the ability to

509
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,079
sell

510
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,880
all of the things that we have stolen to

511
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,480
a market that is pre

512
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,160
uh preloaded so we can have a malware

513
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,319
and a market so we can have more

514
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,720
motivation to use this kind of malware

515
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,839
and of course still more information

516
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,119
what's next so as we can see

517
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,720
there is a huge difference between all

518
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,119
of them but we cannot predict for a

519
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,000
hundred percent

520
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and say exactly what is going to be but

521
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,439
we can say that

522
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,640
we will see more and more uh malwares

523
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,079
and information stealers

524
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,400
like paulu and this and the zero max

525
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,440
theater because

526
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,360
information stealer it's pretty light

527
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,559
it's pretty easy it's

528
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,880
quick and we believe that more and more

529
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,400
attackers will follow

530
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,720
that path and we'll try to create more

531
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,400
and more variants like that

532
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,799
because it's much much much much more

533
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,400
harder to detect

534
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,320
and it takes less effort from the

535
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,240
attacker to actually set up

536
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,240
some cnc servers and more

537
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,280
so for more information please feel free

538
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,240
to reach us

539
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,840
thank you very much
