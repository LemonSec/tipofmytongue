1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,360
hi everyone and welcome to creating

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,240
network effects

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,759
intelligence sharing for supply chain

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,839
security my name is andrea little

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:08,800
lombago

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,160
i'm the vice president of research and

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,160
analysis at enteros and i'm thrilled to

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,519
be here at the threat intelligence

9
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,000
practitioner summit at virus bolton

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,760
today what we'll be talking about

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,680
is the essential role that intelligence

12
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,520
sharing can play for supply chain

13
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,160
security across your entire ecosystem

14
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,920
now before getting into this role of

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,599
intelligence sharing it's really

16
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,359
important to first understand

17
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,519
just how complex supply chains have

18
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,960
become and how fragile

19
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,960
and insecure they become to then

20
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,880
highlight just the how foundational

21
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,559
intelligence sharing is for supply chain

22
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,120
security

23
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,480
and so i'd first like to focus on is

24
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,640
that within global brands

25
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,000
it's not just a few suppliers that they

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,840
may have it's tens of thousands

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,760
or even hundreds of thousands of

28
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,879
suppliers

29
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,000
and so when you think about gaining

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,520
visibility and threat intelligence

31
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,800
sharing

32
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,000
if you have hundreds of thousands of

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,320
suppliers it becomes very very hard to

34
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,359
understand

35
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,280
who all those partners are within your

36
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,640
network and what their levels of

37
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,920
security are

38
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,600
so it really does broaden the attack

39
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,360
surface in ways

40
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,840
really an unprecedent from previous eras

41
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,920
so how did we get to this point and so

42
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,920
let's quickly walk through how we got to

43
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,400
the

44
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,159
area where supply chains can have

45
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,520
hundreds of thousands of partners

46
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,080
because that

47
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,600
really does just seem overwhelming in

48
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,159
numbers and so it all goes back you

49
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,240
in post-world war ii era look at the 50s

50
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,240
and 60s the advent of computers and

51
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,520
containerization

52
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,479
warehouse management that really helped

53
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,759
to expand

54
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,400
supply and and trade practices across

55
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,520
the globe

56
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,360
and so that continued at a decent pace

57
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,920
but really took off in the 80s and 90s

58
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,520
when the end of the cold war started to

59
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,280
spark a shift towards manufacturing in

60
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,000
asia

61
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and really importantly the japanese

62
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,240
model of lean production took off

63
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,680
and why that's so important because it

64
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,840
really highlighted and focused on this

65
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,399
role of

66
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,640
optimization and so what that means is

67
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,240
really doing just in time production so

68
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,719
that

69
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,880
the production within the warehouses was

70
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,079
only stuck

71
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,920
stocked enough to have whatever was

72
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,360
needed in the very near future

73
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,038
and as we've seen over the last few

74
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,878
months that's part of the reason why

75
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,239
we've had such extensive

76
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,480
disruptions across supply chains not the

77
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,080
only reason but it helps contribute to

78
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,840
it

79
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,440
so during all those technological and

80
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,360
geopolitical shifts that were going on

81
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,040
the beginning of 2000 as the internet

82
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,560
took off and as china became a member of

83
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,599
the wto

84
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,280
we saw again this enormous

85
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,879
transformation in the

86
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,480
shifting of the world system at the same

87
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,120
time as the drivers of technology

88
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,519
leading to a doubling of global trade

89
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,640
during this time period

90
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
and so it's really the height of global

91
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,920
interdependence and trade going on

92
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,440
during this time

93
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,360
and then really over the last decade yet

94
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,680
again technology plays a very big role

95
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,000
in the expansion of globalization and

96
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,879
global trade

97
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,640
with internet of things big data

98
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,560
analytics production automation and so

99
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,120
forth

100
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,200
and this automation continued and so

101
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,879
while technology took off

102
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,519
we also saw china's role as the world

103
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,239
supplier

104
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,640
and really the a huge concentration

105
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,440
component

106
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,920
of trade going in and out of china

107
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,280
really to a point that it was such a

108
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,480
focal node

109
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,159
that hadn't been in existence before

110
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,000
across the supply chains

111
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
and so we got to this point where really

112
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,120
interconnected

113
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,959
very complex with hundreds of thousands

114
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,159
of suppliers

115
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,599
and then at the same time this

116
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,200
concentration within china

117
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,680
and this just-in-time automation led to

118
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,959
an environment

119
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,120
where when kobe came along earlier this

120
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,280
year the global pandemic

121
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,959
just really shook the foundations of

122
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,400
that system

123
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,959
so you look at the graphs of the trade a

124
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,159
global trade fell

125
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,120
at a record level and so there are many

126
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,319
records that have been broken on the

127
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,680
trade and economic front over this past

128
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
year in addition to the

129
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,920
horrific human toll that is the pandemic

130
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,120
has caused

131
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,560
on the in the area of supply chain

132
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,680
that's global supply disruption of trade

133
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,360
really just disrupted all the supply

134
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,120
chains as well we see trade falling for

135
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,599
u.s

136
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,920
uh in china as well you can see a little

137
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,360
bit on the

138
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,760
on the graph where the trade war already

139
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,200
started to see a decline in trade

140
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480
between the two countries

141
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,680
but it still continues to uh decline

142
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,360
since the beginning of covet and so

143
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,400
there are all these trends that were

144
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,280
already

145
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
accelerate that were already existing

146
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,799
prior to the pandemic that are now

147
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,798
accelerated including the geopolitical

148
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,918
tensions going on

149
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,478
and a distrust of trade between two of

150
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,079
the major powers across the global

151
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,479
system

152
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,360
and so we're at a point with just

153
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,000
enormous supply chain fragility

154
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,919
they were extraordinarily complex that

155
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,440
again gets to the

156
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,880
thousands tens of thousands hundreds of

157
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,120
thousands of pliers all across and

158
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,320
if you look at that i think that graph

159
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,160
is actually a nice uh

160
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,520
visualization because that really is

161
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,639
what it looks like when you start to map

162
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,759
out all the different suppliers

163
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,479
super super complex super integr uh

164
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,840
related integrated

165
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,120
um just leading to basically just uh

166
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,000
very complex supply chain systems that

167
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,960
then become

168
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,040
very opaque because it's really hard to

169
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,320
gain visibility across

170
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,840
all of your partners across that entire

171
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,680
supply chain and so there might be

172
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,720
vulnerabilities in there but they're

173
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,080
masked because you can't see them

174
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,080
so in addition to that we also have the

175
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,919
concentration risk so these bottlenecks

176
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:10,639
in china

177
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,080
that we highlighted in the previous

178
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
slide just increases concentration risk

179
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,360
and it's not just a geographical

180
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,639
concentration risk

181
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,680
it's also a risk that can occur from

182
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,759
uh focus on a specific vendor if there's

183
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,960
a concentration risk there

184
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,800
but also on the geography and in certain

185
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,039
products and so any kind of

186
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,560
over reliance and over concentration

187
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,479
within a supply chain does in turn make

188
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,520
it fragile

189
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,639
and in addition to geopolitical tensions

190
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,240
we see the floods in china also cause

191
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,360
major disruption across supply chains

192
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,120
and finally in india perhaps most

193
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,680
related all of these together combine to

194
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,360
create just enormous insecurity

195
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,880
across supply chain ecosystems

196
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,280
and that's really what we'll be focusing

197
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,720
on is just this complexity

198
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,280
this limited visibility also helping

199
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,880
highlight the ip theft and cyber

200
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,759
vulnerabilities and

201
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,919
even the legal risks that can emerge and

202
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,400
so as globalization has taken off

203
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,479
as we've seen the supply chains become

204
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,240
extraordinarily interdependent

205
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,560
and opaque you see the concentrations

206
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,080
risk going and you see this

207
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,720
globalization getting really disrupted

208
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,360
during

209
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,600
uh prior to covet and then it's really

210
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,880
uh accelerated

211
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,960
after it and along with all that came

212
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,199
along these these security risks

213
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,800
both by having an over concentration in

214
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,479
certain countries that may mandate

215
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,919
access that's where the legal risk comes

216
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,919
in they there are certain governments

217
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,280
that mandate access to data if your data

218
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,479
is stored in those countries so that's

219
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,800
some data localization laws

220
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
so just a whole range of risks are

221
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,639
starting to emerge into super insecurity

222
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,840
across the entire

223
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,119
supply chain ecosystem

224
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,759
and so it's no surprise given everything

225
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,440
that has walked through the

226
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,199
the complexity the opacity the

227
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,680
concentration resistance and security

228
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,280
should be no surprise that supply chain

229
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,720
attacks continue to be on the rise

230
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
and so just for a little a few data

231
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,479
points to help highlight that

232
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,400
uh according to one study your supply

233
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,240
chain attacks increased 78

234
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,720
in 2019 and so clearly that's just an

235
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,479
enormous jump from from previous years

236
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,319
at the same time we're seeing 60 of data

237
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,000
breaches that are linked to third-party

238
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,880
vendors

239
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,960
uh also increasing so again when we

240
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,080
think about

241
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,919
the role of third party risk management

242
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,199
very often you see

243
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,880
focus on your immediate partners but not

244
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,080
necessarily your partner's partners and

245
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,120
so forth but

246
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,319
with this integration and their

247
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,560
dependencies go across the supply chain

248
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,840
that's where you start seeing additional

249
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,039
so it's not surprised to see some of

250
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,720
these big jumps given that foundation

251
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,319
that we laid out as far as the

252
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,840
how supply chains actually work together

253
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,440
and how just interrelated and complex

254
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,840
they are

255
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,440
so we're also seeing a thousand percent

256
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,880
increase in financial crimes linked to

257
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,000
third parties and that's just

258
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,199
a staggering increase and then next-gen

259
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,000
supply chain tax

260
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,599
just more advanced supply chains

261
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,960
especially going in through apps and

262
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,000
different kinds of

263
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,759
updates which we'll talk about you know

264
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,919
surging 430

265
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,360
so these are all different studies but

266
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,120
at the end of the day they all highlight

267
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,639
very very similar trends

268
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,400
that supply chain attacks are on the

269
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,719
rise

270
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,879
and it's to the point that earlier this

271
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,160
year the fbi issued a notification

272
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,440
focused on cyber supply chain campaigns

273
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,039
that are targeting certain industries in

274
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,560
this case it's targeting the health care

275
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,440
sector

276
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,879
and so this is something that we'll see

277
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,560
again again throughout this talk is that

278
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,879
very often these supply chain attacks

279
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,560
are targeting certain industries

280
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,720
and so that can help highlight just how

281
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,000
much there needs to be that information

282
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,199
sharing intelligence sharing

283
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,800
both across industries and then within

284
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,080
your supply chain as well

285
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,080
now let's first focus on physical supply

286
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,360
chains because

287
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,399
for the most part when you think about

288
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,159
supply chains i think people get in

289
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,039
their mind

290
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,040
uh just you know they've got views of

291
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,959
ports and warehouses

292
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,160
and various kinds of logistics and

293
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,600
certainly that's the foundation to it

294
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,720
all

295
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,000
but we don't really think about how

296
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,760
those different ports of entry can also

297
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,240
become

298
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,720
point points of entry uh for supply

299
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,000
chain attacks

300
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,640
and so suppliers and partners are very

301
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,480
increasingly the point of entry into

302
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,160
your network and so uh in the past we've

303
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,920
talked about unfortunately target seems

304
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,360
to be the name that always pops up for

305
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,399
these kind of

306
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,760
uh third-party uh risk and access

307
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,720
when one of their hvac contractors uh

308
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,399
access to that network then became an

309
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,640
access to the network of target but they

310
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,160
are by no means alone and that that's

311
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,279
something to really

312
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,240
uh you know highlight or illuminate

313
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,040
because if you look at the

314
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
stats i showed on the previous screen

315
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,200
you know it's increasingly common

316
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,839
the f-35 similarly you know it wasn't

317
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,480
the

318
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,600
the main um supplier it was it was a

319
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,399
supplier

320
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,240
and a contractor you know of a major

321
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
corporation that was the one that ended

322
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,480
up

323
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,360
uh becoming the access into it and so as

324
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,120
organizations especially as these big

325
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,200
you know fortune 500 global brands as

326
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,720
they become better and better defending

327
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,680
themselves

328
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,120
what you see is that attackers work to

329
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,480
look to the weakest link and that

330
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,399
weakest link may be your initial partner

331
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,000
but due to the supply chains and just

332
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,440
how broad and

333
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,959
expansive they are it might be your

334
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,120
supplier suppliers or their suppliers it

335
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,959
really can go on

336
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,760
and while all that's going on for the

337
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,440
most part suppliers are really viewed

338
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,800
though as trusted networks and so

339
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,600
they're not

340
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,040
always brought in when thinking about

341
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,800
third party risk management because if

342
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,320
it's a trusted partner why do you need

343
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,519
to defend against it

344
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,120
and so that perception needs to change

345
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,320
they still can be trusted as far as

346
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,440
having a partnership

347
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,480
we need to think about what they're

348
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,800
doing for their security uh and how that

349
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,000
may impact you as well

350
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,120
and how it may impact the broader

351
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,240
ecosystem

352
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,399
now there also are really the focus on

353
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,920
digital supply trainers and digital

354
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,200
supply chains

355
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,880
attacks can manifest themselves in

356
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,560
numerous ways it could be along the

357
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,760
lines of installing a

358
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,360
malicious hardware software for back

359
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,120
door access and control

360
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,640
and so if you think about the cleaner

361
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,040
attack from a few years ago

362
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,959
is a really good case in point so what

363
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,240
happened during that point

364
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,320
during that attack uh was that a

365
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,600
legitimate software

366
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,760
update the ccleaner legitimate software

367
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,040
the update within it

368
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,399
was injected with malware and so at the

369
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,519
at the peak of that 2.25

370
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,959
million downloads of the software of the

371
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:09,440
update

372
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,079
the corrupted update uh was downloaded

373
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,440
so that's extensive that's

374
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,839
millions of uh of computers are impacted

375
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,800
by it

376
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,959
but only one well over one and a half

377
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,200
million of those phoned home

378
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,839
and of those it turned out that 40

379
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,360
organizations were targeted

380
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,399
and so i think it's a really good

381
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,040
example of how even for very targeted

382
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,160
attacks

383
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
others may get caught within the they

384
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,680
get caught within it and download some

385
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,640
of the corrupt

386
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,279
files because they're part of that that

387
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,800
ecosystem and they're able to get in and

388
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,000
that's that's sort of the backdoor

389
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,200
attack the installation of malicious

390
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,079
hardware and so

391
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,240
even for very targeted attacks others

392
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,839
can become

393
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,800
collateral damage within that and so

394
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,920
that's one way you also can think about

395
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,880
the installation of

396
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,880
counterfeit hardware or software again

397
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,720
that impacts trust

398
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,320
you could be relying on a malicious or

399
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,920
unqualified service provider

400
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,200
it's another way for digital supply

401
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
chain attack to happen and sometimes it

402
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,480
can be unintentional uh with

403
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,680
unintentional hardware software

404
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,720
vulnerabilities

405
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,639
and this is something that we see

406
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,560
increasingly with misconfigured clouds

407
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,279
where

408
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,680
it could be one of your partners exposes

409
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,120
your data because they misconfigure

410
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,120
their own cloud and so it may not be

411
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,519
uh something that is in your control it

412
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,399
may not be

413
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,240
uh something that's intentional and that

414
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,519
may not be a malicious intent but it

415
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:21,839
does

416
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,519
happen it can impact the security of

417
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,839
your of your data

418
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,920
and so one more example of the malicious

419
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,040
hardware software providing that

420
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,360
backdoor is dragonfly 2.0

421
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,959
again very you know recent attack where

422
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,279
trojan software was in the updates very

423
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,639
similar with you know to see cleaner as

424
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,160
far as the focus on the updates

425
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,240
uh leveraging phishing emails again

426
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,600
major uh

427
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,920
you know it remains a major point of

428
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,000
entry uh this one focused on targeting

429
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,279
the energy sector

430
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,440
so again again we see the the sector

431
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,200
component becomes very very important

432
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,680
which is

433
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,360
again why within supply chains why that

434
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,720
communication across

435
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,079
your industry but really within across

436
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,680
your suppliers becomes really really

437
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,079
important

438
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,040
now i like this because it's a good

439
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,279
example of how intelligence is really

440
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,320
just growing importance

441
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,839
as the globe is going through so many

442
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,760
shifts and so as i i've

443
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,560
alluded to you know with the supply

444
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,880
chain disruptions of the last six months

445
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,160
that's going on at the same time as all

446
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,519
these geopolitical shifts that are going

447
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,240
on

448
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,160
and so more and more organizations are

449
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,680
rethinking what does it mean to

450
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,839
to have security uh within you know

451
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,320
going forward within a trusted network

452
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,200
you know what does that look like within

453
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,040
a re-globalized world and so this was a

454
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,800
really uh interesting op-ed that focused

455
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,320
on the imports of maritime

456
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,079
so kind of going back and focusing on

457
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,519
what we really you traditionally think

458
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,360
about when we think about supply chains

459
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,600
and and within those areas this is a

460
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,519
necessity for information sharing

461
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,839
uh across the community is really

462
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,680
becoming highlighted as foundational for

463
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,320
security

464
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,079
and for situational awareness across the

465
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,600
entire operations

466
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,440
and so even within these broad logistics

467
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,279
chains and so forth

468
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,880
the role of information sharing just

469
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,399
remains foundational

470
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,240
uh to that it's for situational

471
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,760
awareness and to

472
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,360
bring together all those diverse data

473
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
sets together so that everyone within

474
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,040
the ecosystem everyone who's partnering

475
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,920
working together

476
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,519
from then it's across the carriers and

477
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,199
the equipment and so forth

478
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,240
uh provide and to yield greater insights

479
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,480
and to be able to proactively identify

480
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,680
vulnerabilities before

481
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,399
they get exploited

482
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,560
and this is i think just gets back to

483
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,639
the overarching theme of supply chain

484
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,760
attacks this is a recent

485
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,519
wall street journal op-ed that i highly

486
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,040
recommend that focuses on

487
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,639
the role of sharing information across

488
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,959
supply chains and it's a substantial

489
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,600
investment

490
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,399
in securing customer data at one company

491
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,000
can easily be undermined

492
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,440
by a supplier with weak financial

493
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,959
incentives for safeguards

494
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,040
now what that really highlights is you

495
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,800
know it gets back to that weakest link

496
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,120
and so you know i think very often we

497
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,480
hear the human is the weakest link in

498
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,680
cyber security and that's you know

499
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,199
perhaps one of my pet feeds i i hate

500
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,480
focusing on that because human elements

501
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:54,880
are

502
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,639
are part of it take that notion

503
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,839
of the weakness link and look at you

504
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,120
know the weakest link tends to be that

505
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,320
that we can slink within the chain of

506
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,279
your of your

507
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,120
of your supply chain and which company

508
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,720
has the weakest security

509
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,560
could then come back and and haunt you

510
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,399
as well and lead to your own insecurity

511
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:10,959
and so

512
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,040
there needs to be incentives to help

513
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,959
encourage across your supply chain

514
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,560
greater collaboration for information

515
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,839
sharing and we'll talk about that in a

516
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,079
bit

517
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,959
and so when thinking about information

518
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,160
sharing you clearly need to know

519
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,240
who is in your network and so that's one

520
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,680
of the first steps is really identifying

521
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,959
what is in your network

522
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,279
and fortunately standardized information

523
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,720
sharing can help

524
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,279
and so currently with such complexity

525
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,920
and opacity within supply chains

526
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,079
really what we're seeing is that there

527
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,600
isn't that visibility you know for the

528
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,199
most part it doesn't exist

529
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,639
and for even places where there is

530
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,639
pretty good visibility uh as we've seen

531
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,399
your supply chains are really changing

532
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,759
quite a bit right now and so

533
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,600
even if you think you have a good idea

534
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
of what your supply chain looks like now

535
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,639
you know a month from now two months

536
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,839
from now it may not do to either you

537
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,680
know bankruptcies shifting suppliers and

538
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,440
so forth the disruptions are having a

539
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,959
ripple effect throughout

540
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,560
and so you need to continuously have

541
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
that visibility across your supply chain

542
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,759
and that's exactly where information

543
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,759
sharing can help to you know to enable

544
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,120
that continuous monitoring

545
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,399
to figure out how some of the companies

546
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,639
are shifting across your supply chain

547
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,320
and you have a good gaze on who and who

548
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,160
the partners are so then from there you

549
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,000
can start focusing on security but

550
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,120
you can't really think about getting the

551
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,480
security unless you know who's in your

552
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,040
network

553
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,160
and to figure out who's your network

554
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,360
that's worth a lot of standardized

555
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,480
information sharing

556
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,360
and sharing of some of the threat

557
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,600
intelligence even can help figure out

558
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,560
and help build out

559
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,240
that situational awareness of what your

560
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,839
ecosystem even looks like

561
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,480
and so the first thing you obviously

562
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,240
when you've got that visibility

563
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,680
next you need to ensure that there's the

564
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,440
fundamentals flow across your entire

565
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,040
supply chain ecosystem

566
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,320
and so don't just have a visibility

567
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,240
visibility for visibility's sake

568
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,560
start then from there start sharing

569
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,440
information

570
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,519
sharing intelligence to figure out uh

571
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,720
where some of those weakest links are

572
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,320
and then to help work as a community

573
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
to help build them build the incentives

574
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,680
and that's where also as you're starting

575
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,680
to think about different partners

576
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,360
across your supply chain you know those

577
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,199
with greater security you know

578
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,640
leverage that up as a higher priority

579
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,559
for who can make it within your own

580
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,000
ecosystem and so it becomes very very

581
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
important to have that kind of

582
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,439
visibility and ensure that their

583
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,199
security and the standards are up

584
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,240
across the system

585
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,119
and so once you've got that you've got

586
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,880
your visibility you're starting to talk

587
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,319
about the security levels and sharing

588
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,000
intelligence

589
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,520
all that together combines to help build

590
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,160
this trusted system of systems and so

591
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,520
you know as we saw with the example of

592
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
the ports you know as far as gaining

593
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,200
situational awareness and gaining

594
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
better visibility of the vulnerabilities

595
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,480
and the threats and various processes

596
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,080
that are going on

597
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,360
a company that's only focused on their

598
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,280
own data doesn't have that complete

599
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,400
situational awareness and i think this

600
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,360
is probably a theme that we're going to

601
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,559
hear throughout

602
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,840
the threat intelligence practitioner

603
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,240
summit diverse data sets coming together

604
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,679
mean better threat intelligence

605
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,400
for everyone involved and so the

606
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,760
essential component of this though

607
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,000
has to be bidirectional and we've seen

608
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,039
over and over again that

609
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,559
information sharing intelligence theory

610
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,840
and sharing when only goes in one

611
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,640
direction

612
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,000
it doesn't build up the trust and then

613
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,080
in fact it can be detrimental because

614
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,320
it can lead to distress because if one

615
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,000
company is sharing all their information

616
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,320
and gets nothing in return they no

617
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,679
longer are incentivized and so the

618
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,039
incentives need to be

619
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,640
in such a way that both companies are

620
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,559
both entities uh feel like they're

621
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,919
benefiting from sharing that data so

622
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,200
that's where that trust comes in

623
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,440
by having bi-directional uh information

624
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,120
sharing where both entities feel like

625
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,320
they're benefiting from it

626
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,160
it creates that trust and that trust

627
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,440
then can permeate throughout your system

628
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,880
so you get a system of systems across

629
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,080
the entire network

630
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,120
of your supply chain

631
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,039
so when we've got to that point it takes

632
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,360
a trusted network you know what does

633
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,720
that really mean and

634
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,480
this is starting to take on even a

635
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,000
higher higher priority

636
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,360
as we start hearing this you know even

637
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,600
in headlines about uh countries across

638
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,120
the globe are starting to figure out

639
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,960
which technologies to allow within their

640
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,480
within their uh both

641
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,640
the government systems but then also

642
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,840
mandating what

643
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,360
any kind of contractors suppliers can

644
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,480
use based on this notion of trust

645
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,760
and so why is that so i highlighted

646
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,400
earlier

647
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,880
this notion of the the re-globalization

648
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,760
of the world and

649
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,280
the shifting geopolitics is shifting

650
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,799
supply chains

651
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,400
all of that again is just accelerating

652
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,640
right now and we're seeing you know

653
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,799
that the fracturing of the internet uh

654
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,480
that you know our radio was going on a

655
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,440
little bit as we started seeing some of

656
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,960
those data localization laws that i that

657
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,400
i've talked about

658
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,720
but what we're seeing is not just in the

659
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,160
policies and laws it's also in the

660
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,280
technologies

661
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,640
and so it's really that splintering of

662
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,400
the internet is also a splintering uh

663
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,360
across hardware as well and creating

664
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,120
these techno spheres of influence

665
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,160
where the home country of some of these

666
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,039
companies becomes

667
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,039
really really important uh because of

668
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,799
some of these digital supply chain risks

669
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,120
that

670
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,720
i talked about earlier and linking them

671
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,960
back to government actions

672
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,919
and so basically whether those

673
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,280
technologies can be used as a trojan

674
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,840
horse for access to certain data

675
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,760
and so because of that because there's

676
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,280
all this lack of trust going on across

677
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,640
the countries because of

678
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,240
you know in sync with the what we've

679
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,679
been seeing on the geopolitical tensions

680
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,039
and as well as the supply chain

681
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,720
disruptions and digital digital supply

682
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,720
chain attacks that are going on

683
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,120
in turn democratic governments across

684
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,760
the globe

685
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,919
are really stepping up and creating some

686
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,960
legislation

687
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,280
that both regulates what tech is allowed

688
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,559
within the system

689
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,919
but also the security controls across

690
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,840
the supply chains and that's why this

691
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,200
matters so often

692
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,000
when we think about the trust issue what

693
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,679
we're hearing more so is a focus

694
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,919
on just within one company that's

695
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,440
expanding into the supply chain networks

696
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,159
because

697
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,480
because of this uh growing trend of

698
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,400
digital supply chain and physical supply

699
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,320
chain attacks really those two can't be

700
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,720
uh disconnected anymore there's so much

701
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,919
intertwined between the physical and the

702
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,919
digital

703
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,320
and so in the us what we see is uh this

704
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,919
year and trusted communication networks

705
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:46,640
act

706
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,919
we're seeing that the federal

707
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,679
acquisition supply chain security act

708
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,640
and that one

709
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,320
specifically has an information sharing

710
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,000
component it highlights who has the

711
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,200
responsibility for information sharing

712
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,080
and ensuring

713
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,840
there's threat intelligence sharing

714
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,600
really across the entire supply chain

715
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,799
ecosystem

716
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,240
and so this notion of trust is so

717
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,720
foundational and so reliant on intel

718
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,320
sharing across companies and across our

719
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,880
supply chain ecosystem

720
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,480
we're seeing it in the new strategy from

721
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,640
uh dhs on 5g

722
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,159
with a focus on expanding situational

723
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,080
awareness of supply chain risks

724
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,799
and a major way of doing that is through

725
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,159
information sharing intelligence sharing

726
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:20,799
so hopefully

727
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,120
by now you're seeing this trend where

728
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,880
intelligence sharing information sharing

729
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,400
helps provide that situational awareness

730
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,320
across the supply chains which is one of

731
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,760
the biggest areas where we're seeing

732
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,559
heightened risk and heightened

733
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,200
vulnerabilities

734
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,799
to further address this uh we're seeing

735
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,880
the task force uh have evolved

736
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,520
and started to emerge to address uh

737
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,280
again these exact same kind of risks and

738
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,880
to then further figure out different

739
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,240
ways that the private sector and public

740
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,760
sector can work together better

741
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,600
again to get some of that bi-directional

742
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,880
information sharing

743
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,080
so it becomes very very important a

744
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,360
whole component of it does focus on

745
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,600
information sharing

746
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,200
and then there's the standards the cyber

747
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,039
security maturity model

748
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,000
certification the cmnmc has now gone to

749
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,640
effect

750
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,960
and so along with that what you're

751
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,880
seeing is that those standards the

752
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,480
hygiene that i showed earlier

753
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,240
companies are increasingly to work with

754
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,640
the government need to have that cmmc

755
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,600
compliance to work within and so i

756
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,960
imagine you're going forward

757
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,159
organizations may be looking more and

758
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,559
more at the cmmc and sort of that proof

759
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,320
of the seal of approval for certain

760
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,360
security standards

761
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,840
within their ecosystem so these are just

762
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,919
a few of them there's a section 889 of

763
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,000
the national defensive authorization act

764
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,559
that prohibits her and um private

765
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,840
certain companies from being within the

766
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,520
supply chain for the federal government

767
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,440
both those you know strongly linked to

768
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,600
china five chinese companies and their

769
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,440
affiliates and so we're just seeing more

770
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,880
and more of this legislation coming to

771
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,280
play

772
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,760
mandating both who can be in your supply

773
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,799
chain

774
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,080
how to share information across your

775
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,840
supply chain and what are the security

776
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,200
standards that also are there

777
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,880
to help improve the security again

778
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,720
across your entire supply chain

779
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,840
and your supply ecosystem

780
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,200
and while right now vivid is focused on

781
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,640
some of those standards

782
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,840
and the technologies it impacts really

783
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,280
every aspect of

784
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,440
hardware and software we're already

785
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,960
seeing different laws and

786
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,799
uh regulations coming out that are

787
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,720
mandating what app stores are allowed

788
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,960
which apps are even allowed uh you know

789
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,840
in india

790
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,360
recently banned over 100 different

791
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,039
chinese-based apps so

792
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,240
this is something that we're going to

793
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,559
keep seeing more and more

794
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,400
uh mandating cloud-based services which

795
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,559
ones are allowed and which ones are not

796
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,559
the same for carriers and you know at

797
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,440
some point make it to the point of

798
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,960
understanding cables which ones might be

799
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,280
uh allowed to be used or which one's not

800
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,720
so all this gets into

801
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,880
what you know the focus on having

802
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,080
trusted networks

803
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,600
and ensuring that there are trusted

804
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,120
networks within your supply chain

805
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,200
it's really going to permeate throughout

806
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,240
uh and

807
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,919
legislation and regulations are just

808
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,200
going to continue coming i mean i think

809
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
it's one of the most

810
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,159
uh dynamic regulatory and compliance

811
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,000
landscapes that we have seen in really

812
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,360
quite some time

813
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,799
and a lot of it is because of this

814
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:57,840
growing trend that we've been seeing on

815
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,199
the digital supply chain tax

816
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,279
uh you know laws has been us focused but

817
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,720
i really really want to highlight

818
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,279
it's more than the us many democracies

819
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,240
are very concerned

820
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,039
uh about technology and software coming

821
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:11,919
from china

822
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,159
but also just ensuring that uh they they

823
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,120
have their own

824
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,039
uh national champions as well in certain

825
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,440
areas and so it's really an interesting

826
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,039
distinction that's starting to emerge in

827
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,200
australia there's a really great report

828
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,720
on supply chains and cyber security so

829
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,360
i'd recommend reading that from aspi

830
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,799
and the focus again is on greater data

831
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,799
security across that supply chain

832
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,559
um what are the what are some standards

833
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,240
for sharing what are some for securing

834
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,200
that data and they

835
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,880
walk through a lot of that that

836
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,720
hopefully can help influence

837
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,320
other democracies as they start thinking

838
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,880
about progressing and prioritizing this

839
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,600
kind of security

840
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,400
in the uk i really like this quote from

841
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,679
the ncsc

842
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,039
do as much as you possibly can to work

843
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,640
with your suppliers supply chain and

844
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,679
partners to help them improve their

845
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:54,880
security

846
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,120
and foundational to that is ensuring

847
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,880
that everyone has situational awareness

848
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,559
through that information sharing through

849
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,919
that intelligence sharing that becomes

850
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,799
very very important

851
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,080
then finally you know uh from constant

852
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
tab when we have three information it's

853
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,200
worse to have it

854
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,640
and not use it than it is to have it not

855
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,400
have it so really

856
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,320
if you have information and intelligence

857
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,840
and you're not sharing it that's even

858
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,720
worse

859
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,480
and we know that's happening and this

860
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,640
this one quote really highlights very

861
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,279
strongly

862
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,200
just that role of bi-directional you

863
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,360
know in the in the role of trust

864
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,279
if entities aren't trusting one another

865
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,720
to be sharing that information they're

866
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,760
not going to share it

867
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,840
and so it's an acknowledged challenge

868
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,200
and problem um

869
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,600
definitely building out that trust is

870
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,320
requires

871
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,840
all sorts it's not a technology problem

872
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,360
you can fix a lot of that certainly

873
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,559
there are aspects of the technology that

874
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,760
helps fix it and ensuring that those

875
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,279
foundation that that cyber hygiene is in

876
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,960
place to secure that data

877
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,720
but overcoming that the trust issue is

878
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,559
really something that uh

879
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,880
you know the task force and other forms

880
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,080
of legislation are really trying to

881
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,279
shift the incentives

882
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,520
to ensure that there is a bidirectional

883
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,440
data sharing aspect of it

884
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,559
to help increase the situational

885
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,919
awareness both for companies

886
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,520
as independent companies but also

887
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,760
acknowledging just the interdependencies

888
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,200
and the integration across the entire

889
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,320
supply chain

890
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
and so i think we're moving a direction

891
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,559
where the problem has been identified

892
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,480
still plenty of emphasis on the tech

893
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,520
solutions which is great but i think

894
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,799
we're getting to the point where

895
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:19,840
really focusing on some of the

896
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,279
organizational issues as well to help

897
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,400
address it

898
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,600
and so to wrap up really the forces

899
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,840
are aligning that are prioritizing

900
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,360
greater security across your supply

901
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,480
chain

902
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,840
so in the beginning we talked about the

903
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,159
increasing attacks and how those attacks

904
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,520
are starting to emerge

905
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,640
because of this expansion of the

906
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,720
complexity the lack of visibility that

907
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,039
massing these vulnerabilities the you

908
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,159
know the

909
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,600
thousand-fold increase in some of these

910
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,000
attacks all that's going on across the

911
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,080
entire supply chain ecosystem

912
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,120
at the same time as geopolitics and just

913
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
a shifting global environment

914
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,039
are leading to greater focus on new

915
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,720
regulations and compliance

916
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,600
to ensure there's trusted software and

917
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,559
trusted security

918
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,760
uh standards going on within your

919
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,279
company and across your entire supply

920
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:07,919
chain

921
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,039
and so whether it's focusing on the

922
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,159
attacks whether it's focusing on the

923
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,760
supply chain compliance and regulations

924
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,279
that are coming

925
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,039
both are coming together to really

926
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,080
highlight the heightened role for

927
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,440
intelligence sharing and supply chain

928
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,640
risk management

929
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,679
so i'm i'm hopeful that this focus will

930
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:22,880
continue

931
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,919
but what we really need to see is that

932
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,120
there's more focusing within our

933
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,480
community to highlight how can we

934
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,320
increase information sharing

935
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,080
and intelligence across the entire

936
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,600
supply chain and

937
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,880
look at different ways not just across

938
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,399
new industries but also think about

939
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,600
these ecosystems to have

940
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,120
and benefit from those network effects

941
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,039
and so just you know a quick way to look

942
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,320
at how you do it you can gain the

943
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,440
visibility

944
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,039
ensure those access controls are going

945
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,360
on securely share that intelligence and

946
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,200
it becomes a virtuous cycle

947
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
you know very often right now there's no

948
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,640
visibility which means you can't verify

949
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,760
any security

950
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,919
and there's in some cases very minimal

951
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:58,799
uh

952
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,399
intelligence sharing across supply

953
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,080
chains so if we can change all that you

954
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,440
benefit from the network effects and

955
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,440
everyone can you know raise up everyone

956
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,960
and make them more secure

957
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,919
and have more timely and insightful

958
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,360
early warning of vulnerabilities and

959
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,399
attacks

960
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,360
in order to defend against them and so i

961
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,440
want to leave off with a

962
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,840
a quote from uh winning ather when

963
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,799
talking about threat intelligence

964
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:21,679
sharing

965
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,360
so it used to be that that defender had

966
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,480
to be right all the time an attacker

967
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,000
only had to be right once we hear this

968
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,279
all the time

969
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,200
but if you have information sharing

970
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,960
especially across the supply chain

971
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,399
now the attacker has to be silent all

972
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,320
the time the defender only has to spot

973
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,279
it once

974
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,919
if someone with any ecosystem spots it

975
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,600
they can share that information

976
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,679
and they can all as a community help

977
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,799
stop it and so

978
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,200
the benefit can go to the defender so i

979
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,640
think it's a great quote i think it's a

980
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,039
point of optimism to end on uh and if we

981
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,320
can all you know work together across

982
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:50,960
the community

983
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,559
across your supply chain to gain this

984
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,799
visibility share intelligence

985
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,120
uh we can help move those stats in the

986
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,399
other direction and really

987
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,840
lead and help strengthen defenses

988
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,240
thank you
