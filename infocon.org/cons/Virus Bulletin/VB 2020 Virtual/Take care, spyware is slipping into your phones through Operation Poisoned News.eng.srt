1
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,719
so my name is nelson williamson sanchez

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,240
i'm going to present operation potion

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,599
news something that we discover a

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,480
beginning

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,600
of this year and

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,880
first of all i would like to thank to

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,160
wireless world people giving us the

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,160
opportunity to prayer to be presenting

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,080
the first fully online

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,519
uh events uh ever done in in the history

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,640
of survivability

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,720
so thank you very much and we are

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,479
covering this agenda so basically what

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,840
we are going to cover is

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,200
to apply where one in uh designer for

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,760
ios

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,800
for ios and design for android

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,640
and the ios version is

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,239
more complex and has more functionality

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,840
and more parts and the drive version but

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,320
both

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,760
the vibration is simpler but have the

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,000
same

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,160
the same relation to this campaign so

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,120
they are both

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,760
in the same campaign so we are covering

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,280
uh both of them

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,080
but in more detail the ios the ios

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,840
version

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,720
and something that we like to do is

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,479
leave a comment about this work because

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,600
uh there was a collaboration across five

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,600
different teams we have the apt team

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,680
the mobile team description team that

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,600
was advanced research team

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,040
uh zero day initiative team zd i

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,840
which i'm a member of so at cdi we have

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,560
a couple of

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,799
uh hunting system that are cutting

40
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,400
sources uh

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,439
like a url from urls uh

42
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,640
scanning uh samples as well and one of

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,439
the trigger

44
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,680
in this system was the one that uh

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,720
started this

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,640
uh the research at the beginning of this

47
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,280
of the year

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,880
i would like to do a special thank you

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,720
to uh

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,680
joseph sichen which is a non-researcher

51
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,799
internationally and

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,040
friend micro and he did he's knowing

53
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,320
that police but he did a good

54
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,000
contribution to this

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,920
uh to this work something that we are

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,280
not going to cover is

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,560
attribution uh so we decided not to go

58
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,080
attribution design not to mention

59
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,598
anything about the tv

60
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,200
even when we know from the beginning

61
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,560
that there was a very well organized

62
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,520
operation

63
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,000
uh we are not talking who is behind it

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,160
so instead we are covering details

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,400
about the operation even we are going to

66
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,959
give some hints about who he began him

67
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,560
it's up to you to have

68
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,160
to write to the final question we are

69
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,920
not going to mention we speak

70
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,280
with possibly behind and

71
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,599
we would like to do some highlights and

72
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,959
this campaign before entering the

73
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:35,680
details

74
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,519
so one of the things the main objective

75
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,720
of the campaign is

76
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,519
pi and establish full control of the ios

77
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,000
android devices as i said before the ios

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
is more complex than the android device

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
but all both have the same effective

80
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,319
so even when they were using the last

81
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,440
exploitation in the case of ios

82
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,879
but the complexity of the ios spyware we

83
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,000
know that this

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,319
developer were working on the team

85
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,840
behind it was working much before

86
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,319
that the time that we are going to

87
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,560
put in this presentation and this was a

88
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,040
very planned attack ahead of time

89
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,239
so we found uh two malicious spyware one

90
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,440
is live spy for ios and one sdms fighter

91
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,280
we named it that we created that name

92
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,760
for them and

93
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,400
and we are going to show up why we

94
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,360
created that name

95
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,560
that name before uh uh

96
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,560
during the presentation also we found

97
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,360
that hong kong uses were targeted

98
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,840
specifically by this by this campaign

99
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,319
the ios spyware is designed

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,360
to monitor certain applications but

101
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,760
the monitor or monitoring of certain

102
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,840
applications for extracting

103
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,239
sensitive information so from safari for

104
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,519
groundbreaking chat

105
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,879
they extract all the possible artifacts

106
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,280
relating to the user behavior

107
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,840
when the user is are playing

108
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,720
using this application and we are going

109
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,480
to show that in the presentation as well

110
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,478
this is uh this uh picture show the

111
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,120
uh full attack chain of the iot device

112
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,399
this is specific already

113
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,160
so from here we are going to discontinue

114
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,440
device spyware

115
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,040
and this is the full attraction so

116
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,320
everything started with malicious

117
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,199
websites

118
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,199
uh the public suicide related to the

119
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,880
landing pages and faces

120
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,400
spreading society silently uh

121
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,320
past safari vulnerability at the time

122
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,240
that half a cv associated with that

123
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,600
as well it was very easy uh correlate

124
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,160
with bach was exploiting we are going to

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,280
choke point

126
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,400
and once they get

127
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,479
protection done they execute the payload

128
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,560
the payload also tried to

129
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,440
to jailbreak but tried to jailbreak the

130
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,520
maximum number of

131
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,919
version the support and maximum number

132
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,759
of ios version

133
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,560
that they could do at the time and we

134
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,919
are going to show why

135
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,639
that happened as well and after that

136
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,199
they

137
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,360
launched a couple of process and they

138
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,440
they end up in the

139
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,000
light mode which is the main model which

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,479
is communicating with the cnc server

141
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,560
and doing the uh

142
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,680
managing of different modules so

143
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,520
through the line module the attacker can

144
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,120
control all the other modes can you take

145
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,639
more you can send commands to the same

146
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,320
command to the model so from here we are

147
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,520
going to uh

148
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,560
discuss the different uh stations

149
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,759
so now now we are going to discuss

150
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,240
the tactics of the malicious website how

151
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,919
they created the amazon site and

152
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,919
what were doing how they were working

153
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,320
that period of time

154
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,479
to get this campaign this campaign

155
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,639
working on

156
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,360
and one of the tactics that we found was

157
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,800
that the domain that we're using were

158
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,880
mimicking high profile events

159
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,319
uh here was one example of hkey

160
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,000
revolution so the skill revolution

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,560
domain it was meaning in the uh

162
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,800
a twitter account which is a hp

163
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,000
revolution

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,199
and uh they that that that account

165
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,919
joined to

166
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,160
twitter in november and specifically the

167
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,840
first tweet was in november 17

168
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,360
2019 what they did in this case was

169
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,560
create

170
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,440
a page uh and they put the page in the

171
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,720
control domain

172
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
and the page has the frame and the last

173
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,639
frame just relay due to the chinese

174
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,800
canadian new paper and that is the only

175
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,080
thing that you can see if you visit this

176
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,520
website and the first link is the

177
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,800
landing page in the land display will

178
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,080
compromise the device if you have

179
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,759
another one the second link is for a

180
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,919
statistic about who using

181
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,199
these uh uh this was

182
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,080
the these you are accessing these uh

183
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,400
this

184
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,479
this page and they leaked some

185
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,440
information here

186
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,280
i'll show at the end what information

187
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,880
they leak in this

188
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,720
in the second view and

189
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,199
another domain before interesting was

190
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,240
poor god day

191
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,759
the brugge days and arguments have

192
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,360
certain coverage in

193
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,639
hong kong and half a fine coincidence

194
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,919
they started the same

195
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,000
november 17th the last year in 2019 the

196
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,960
same day that

197
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,960
was the first twitter account uh tweets

198
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,000
uh of dragon that i showed before and uh

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,919
the tactics of the techniques that they

200
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,120
were using here

201
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,560
was just mirroring a page from

202
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,840
an all new site with hkap4daily.com

203
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,440
and they mirrored the page and they

204
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,440
inserted the one

205
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,919
iframe there to go to to attack the user

206
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,280
and both url were posted in hong kong

207
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,720
forums

208
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,000
and the public on concourse

209
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,000
and from here so

210
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,400
i would like to discuss the uh the back

211
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,360
by itself

212
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,599
so we have the the tactic that we're

213
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,599
using for luring the user to see the

214
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,639
websites and

215
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,800
that have a landing page and the line

216
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,840
page has

217
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,080
exploitation for this specific box so

218
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,520
everything started with the

219
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,840
known researcher when when the

220
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,960
non-researchers look at today's

221
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,840
composted

222
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,599
water and they that he found one and

223
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,240
they

224
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,160
in javascript core he posted the plc

225
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,560
but when you analyze the timeline of

226
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,840
that poc

227
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,560
you will find out that the back was

228
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,680
already fixed in

229
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,960
june 19. and

230
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,719
at the time that he posted of course it

231
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,640
was ending because i bought forever for

232
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,519
places to

233
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,440
already fix it but uh if you track

234
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,679
the versions uh if you go through every

235
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,039
this information is completely full

236
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,560
because you can track by yourself

237
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,640
if you track the version uh which is

238
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,560
affecting affected by this with the

239
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,760
spock you will see

240
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,720
that this box is not fixed until the

241
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,440
release

242
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,080
of july 22nd so on july 22nd apple

243
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
released the actual official

244
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,519
uh uh updates

245
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,839
for the final user which is fixed this

246
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,959
book so

247
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,720
at the end of the day that means that

248
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,800
the book the back

249
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,160
was known for uh was a number

250
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,880
for apple developers that was a zero day

251
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,320
from the point of view

252
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,120
of final customer and it was a c day for

253
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,000
17 days

254
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,760
so the question is is this time window

255
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,240
being used by the attackers or not that

256
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,120
is

257
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,920
uh the interesting question here and

258
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,040
something to be noticed if you are uh

259
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,600
as if you are a company software company

260
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,120
that have a pulley tracking system you

261
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,640
have to be careful

262
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,399
with the bug that you fixed there

263
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,240
because attackers are looking at the box

264
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,279
actually

265
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,320
and uh taking to use that small wheel in

266
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,560
this case maybe not the case

267
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,720
but uh that is center of the portion i

268
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,200
think we had presentations at some

269
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,160
events

270
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,120
uh before that show up how the attacker

271
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,760
used

272
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,200
the time window looking for open source

273
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,600
uh code which is fixed some information

274
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,200
but actually the final product

275
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,440
after digit and that that window is very

276
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,399
critical

277
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,680
uh for compromising users

278
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,959
and if you see uh this is one section

279
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,880
from the split by itself from the in the

280
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,839
wire display

281
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,519
and they support the version 120. sorry

282
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,040
12.2 and that is

283
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,959
uh why they actually were no use

284
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,279
the time window of the saturday of the

285
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,480
zero day

286
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,680
because uh even when the 12.3 version

287
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,800
was vulnerable

288
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,240
right and they also only cover

289
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,279
uh 12.2 that means that

290
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,200
they were attacking them wash devices

291
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,279
uh at the final or the other final

292
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,399
customer and not

293
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,760
by utilizing the the 17-day

294
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,120
uh zero day which would be for my point

295
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,240
of view recession

296
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,680
would be great but that was not the case

297
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,160
and uh the back by itself

298
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,760
is uh just in type type confusion

299
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,600
and we are going to enter in the detail

300
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
how this ploy the back

301
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,320
where the behavior of the back how what

302
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,600
at the back by itself

303
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,839
uh we put a slide here just for the

304
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,440
comments we don't have time

305
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,640
uh to cover the detail here uh we

306
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,360
post in the in the in the blog that we

307
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,040
publish in try macro in the white

308
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,720
in the white paper uh in the paper for

309
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,760
white holiday we post uh put reference

310
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,399
there

311
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,560
where you can go and visit and read more

312
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,600
about this read more about this

313
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,399
and once you get this protection of the

314
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,360
bug

315
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,040
you get another interesting part of the

316
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,120
attack which is the

317
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,800
payload solution so the payload

318
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,160
execution which is namely payload in the

319
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,680
in the in display by itself

320
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,000
uh it tried to cover the maximum

321
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,440
possible versions

322
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,800
at the time uh with the pull information

323
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,440
is the conclusion that we have so they

324
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,800
including that payload

325
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,000
they uncover uh jailbreak tool

326
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,040
and they go uncover uh uncovered the

327
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,240
jailbreak tool includes all these uh

328
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,680
cv but the vc is covering only 12.1 uh

329
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,680
12.12 version it's not going to the 12.2

330
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,600
that's why they need something else to

331
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,800
get that ratio

332
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,639
and another interesting thing that found

333
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,839
this by lot is

334
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,279
that the pelois sign with the

335
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,399
developer certificates from apple uh

336
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,560
services in november 29 2019. so this is

337
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,040
the

338
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,160
day range that we are moving

339
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,279
or we are moving uh around this in this

340
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,600
presentation

341
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,519
this is the correlation between cover

342
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,800
and the pilot

343
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
payload the compilot so it's support to

344
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,880
the version 12.1 so if you go to the

345
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,240
payload and you compile that you will

346
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,959
see

347
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,480
the full uncovered uh so-called embed

348
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,880
in the in individuals everything is

349
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,920
based on that

350
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,519
but i said before it's not covered in

351
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,320
12.2 to cover 2.2 they

352
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,839
include these another exploit which is a

353
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,079
subport

354
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,120
using this cv and

355
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,800
at the time they were working in this

356
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,959
project that was completely public so

357
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:27,519
they

358
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,360
was very easy for them to incorporate

359
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,680
and elevate a little bit more

360
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,920
the number of ratios supported by the

361
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,880
attack

362
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,160
and this ploy also have a very

363
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,399
very nice history with the buck was

364
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,000
fixed in 12.3 but also was

365
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,199
broken and was uh i thought i wanted

366
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,560
in 12.4 so the thing is because

367
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,480
these the 12.3 passed this back

368
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
they they don't have oil orchards on the

369
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,519
fallback

370
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,480
to 12.2 and that was the only option

371
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,199
that they have

372
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,519
so they fall back to 12.2 because they

373
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,639
don't have any

374
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,000
fully available uh

375
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,519
jailbreak variability to use at the time

376
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,880
so they were sure of uh resources

377
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,399
to go for the uh 17-day zero-day window

378
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,720
that is our conclusion this uh of this

379
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,959
analysis so they fall back to 12.2 that

380
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,839
is the maximum version that they

381
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,920
supported better and

382
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,800
uh so this is how they introduced the

383
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,440
support

384
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,120
in the code so they introduced the

385
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,639
entry point of the support exploit

386
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,519
at the beginning of the jailbreak

387
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,680
jailbreak or main function of the

388
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,399
uncover

389
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,480
so this is like seems like a

390
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,920
last time or later time addition to

391
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,720
destroy it

392
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,959
to cover more more devices this is the

393
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,320
feeling that i have

394
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,360
for this uh way that they combine both

395
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,959
both plates once the deployed is working

396
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:07,519
the

397
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,320
the the spywares start downloading a

398
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,079
bunch of

399
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,760
of of of modules

400
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,040
and then they launched uh

401
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,880
another another process we have a

402
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,320
configuration they then

403
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,920
launched another one which contained the

404
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,160
configuration for the cnc

405
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,720
and with the configuration from the cnc

406
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,160
they start another module which is the

407
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,040
main module

408
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,720
which is communicated with the cnc

409
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,399
server and that is

410
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,639
this model is named light that's why we

411
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,199
named livespike

412
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,120
and we found that this configuration

413
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,920
file has

414
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,040
uh an android dmm

415
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,600
inside so we said okay so this may be is

416
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,160
uh

417
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,639
android version of this so that is why

418
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,040
we involve other research team and train

419
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,759
macro so

420
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,519
to work in parallel because working

421
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,000
against time so this is the timing thing

422
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
because everything can shoot down in

423
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,079
fact many of some of the android

424
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,880
indicator that we found was already

425
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,560
deleted from from

426
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,880
from from fully sourced from forums

427
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,759
awards already

428
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,199
so that was uh fighting against time for

429
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,759
forecasting all the information this

430
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,920
discovery

431
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,160
and the live module basically is

432
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,360
responsible for

433
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,240
uh for connecting to back to the cnc

434
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,920
survey and doing the mobile management

435
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,720
have a very

436
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,639
good architecture and they communicate

437
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,120
using websocket and the format of the of

438
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,440
the

439
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,440
data is embedded in this one in the json

440
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,720
format and with that

441
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,959
uh this main model is capable of

442
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:43,920
deploying

443
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,320
common to specific blue ink plugins and

444
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,680
is a very well uh

445
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,880
very well designed from the point of

446
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,959
view of architecture and

447
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,680
very flexible uh you can say and from

448
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,040
here we are going to talk

449
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,440
uh some of them all that we think that

450
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,360
are interesting with this

451
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,880
percentage so first of all we are we are

452
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,599
going to show the shell command module

453
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,000
we

454
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
allowed to the attack allowed to attack

455
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,039
it to do real

456
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,760
uh time full control of the devices so

457
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,359
this

458
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,199
module the only thing that is doing is

459
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,559
just uh

460
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,359
executing comma so uh it receives a

461
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,959
couple of parameters like a command a

462
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,240
working directory

463
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,919
the free the first thing that i did is

464
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,440
cd to the working directory and

465
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,039
executing a cover

466
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,160
and it sends respondbacks to the api

467
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,600
channel results uh

468
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,919
endpoint in the api of the cnc server

469
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,880
and and this is the way that is work the

470
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,080
changes they will give you

471
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,000
full control anytime you can execute any

472
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,600
command even you can execute so there is

473
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:47,840
all

474
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,440
we are going to describe other modules

475
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,280
that allow you to upload files so you

476
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,320
can load file

477
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,720
and then execute through here and you

478
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,360
have the full

479
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,600
the full chain control of what you can

480
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,880
do with the device

481
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,400
and all over the place in all the

482
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,160
modules

483
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,440
you can see a chinese strings everywhere

484
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,919
even for logging errors

485
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,400
for tracking the execution of the of the

486
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,440
modules by itself

487
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,559
and another is the screen screen module

488
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,000
so the screen module

489
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,280
is it's a funny module because

490
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,480
we found that the module name is

491
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,320
not matching with the functionality of

492
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,840
the model so this is a screen name but

493
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,919
the functionality of the model is just

494
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,840
network scan so they combine a couple of

495
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,200
open source tools like

496
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,240
a mm-1 scan and

497
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,360
we start functionality they intend to

498
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,160
map or to find all the ap in your

499
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,039
network

500
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,919
uh so they go they p the mask and they

501
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,280
combine both and they find all the

502
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,720
network that all the ip that they want

503
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,360
the scan

504
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,760
and they scan all the availables are p2c

505
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,960
to get information about that there's

506
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,480
return there is phone back that respond

507
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,120
back to api land devices

508
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,679
and this wall have some interesting

509
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,160
thing which

510
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,720
is is the one with leaking the most

511
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,200
long so the longest uh project

512
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,919
uh structure so you see in the last in

513
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,760
the last in the last image

514
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,039
at the bottom so the whole prior

515
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,720
structure that we're in the developer

516
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
machine is that

517
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,760
of of the developer of this spyware

518
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,200
and they got uh f wireholds there that

519
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,400
we don't know

520
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,760
what is the uh house there

521
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,080
but there is uh you can get a sense of

522
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,640
what is the

523
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,000
structure of the project so there is

524
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,520
another model which is file managed the

525
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,480
file manager can

526
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,400
load copy move the leads another

527
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,840
operation on files

528
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,640
and have some very targeted operations

529
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,039
over

530
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,760
all very targeted commands for a

531
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,440
specific application for this specific

532
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,480
application

533
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,880
and they send everything to the api form

534
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,840
file

535
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,640
endpoint in the cnc center in the cnc

536
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,080
control server

537
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,520
and the uh

538
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,480
objective for this uh specific

539
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,760
application in this case

540
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,440
for this for the pacific application in

541
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,799
this case you just

542
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,760
get the file list in this case so they

543
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,000
have

544
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,679
other modules specific for each

545
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,360
application but this one

546
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,679
uh includes functionality to get the

547
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,559
file list for

548
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,880
those and those applications so other

549
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,240
models have the soft info

550
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,640
so this all soft info it get the entire

551
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,600
applications

552
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,000
you get the list of running processes

553
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,679
and there is another model they say

554
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,480
wi-fi

555
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,320
and the wi-fi model is interesting

556
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,480
because i try to get all the wi-fi

557
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,559
which i connect this to you all the

558
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,880
wi-fi names that are surrounded to you

559
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,280
even if you have the wi-fi disabled the

560
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,440
module will enable the wi-fi

561
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,679
and start scanning

562
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,440
the for trying to get the

563
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,400
wi-fi near to you this is uh a very good

564
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,840
information we give you a lot of detail

565
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,760
about where you're moving on where

566
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,799
what it calls to you locations uh by the

567
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,720
name of the wi-fi you can find many

568
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,200
interesting stuff and uh

569
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,480
there is another model which is a

570
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,000
browser module so the browser mode is

571
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,960
covering

572
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,720
safari and chrome and what it's doing is

573
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,640
getting the history they don't

574
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,880
feedback the whole file but they query

575
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,799
the file they parse the file which is

576
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,600
normally a

577
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,400
sql lite device they pass the file they

578
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,159
extract the field

579
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,600
they are interested on and they feedback

580
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,640
that to the to the api browser history

581
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,280
and we have the location module which is

582
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,880
trying to get all the post information

583
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,320
about the location of the device that

584
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,200
provide the api of the device and they

585
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,480
start the telemetry that they

586
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,760
send back and they have a special

587
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,520
condition for the location if you are in

588
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,039
china so they have pressure calculation

589
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:53,679
there

590
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,760
for the locations so we are not going to

591
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,720
talk about that

592
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,080
why did these these

593
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,039
specific conditions there but there is a

594
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:03,840
very

595
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,679
clear function there for if you are in

596
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,360
china they do a specific condition if

597
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,240
you are not

598
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,760
do another calculation

599
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,720
uh these spyware also have uh targeted

600
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,840
word specific

601
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,000
uh capabilities so we don't have time to

602
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,600
cover all the modules here and all the

603
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,320
details

604
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,960
so what we are going to say here is the

605
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,039
the spyware the ios by wire have a

606
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,039
specific mobile phone chats for qq and

607
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,080
for teleram

608
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,559
and they have work like quite similar

609
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,720
they locate the sensitive file of this

610
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,600
application

611
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,360
they parse the file according to the

612
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,799
form and extract the field

613
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,480
and they send information back to the

614
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,640
cnc so the information that is

615
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,480
destructive on this file is the chat

616
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,520
message the

617
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,320
chat contacts the chat head contact

618
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,559
image which is

619
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,440
very nice information you can have a

620
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,120
more picture of people that is talking

621
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,159
to you

622
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,720
and the personal log information onto

623
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,280
those

624
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,280
applications whatever it is uh whatever

625
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,520
is possible so these are modules that

626
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:01,840
are

627
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,919
designed specifically because you didn't

628
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,600
find any other one

629
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,240
and uh for any other application so we

630
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,400
have chrome safari with chat keep going

631
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,039
there

632
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,200
where they want to release in these

633
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,360
cases

634
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,600
uh so if you remember from the last

635
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,200
configuration in the main module

636
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,159
we have uh we have one android there and

637
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,840
one reward that i mean

638
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,559
and that three year second research uh

639
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,159
looking for more posts more

640
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,720
uh aspect of this campaign more uh

641
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,159
you can say indicator of the campaign

642
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,000
and we actually found uh

643
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,480
android uh application which is this as

644
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,280
a calendar

645
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,600
and the calendar for uh hong kong

646
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,120
democratic freedom activity

647
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,880
and supposedly calendar is going to have

648
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,799
all the dates that activity is going to

649
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,840
take place

650
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,400
but if we dig deeper in these uh android

651
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,000
power and we found correlation in the

652
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,600
domains and the fracture that we're

653
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
using with the

654
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,080
uh ios uh uh

655
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,120
with ios infra bios uh ios firewall as

656
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,039
well and we think that these two are

657
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,360
correlated so the complexity of this dms

658
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,000
uh

659
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,880
right it's not like that it's not like

660
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,440
ios

661
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,080
is much better from the point of view of

662
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,640
uh

663
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,960
of architecture but uh this one is

664
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,120
you don't think is uh part of the

665
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,880
campaign uh we think he's part of the

666
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,600
campaign

667
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,440
and also that we think it started before

668
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,880
so the link was spotted in fifth

669
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,760
november

670
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,919
and we found the uh apk apk

671
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,960
was uh the android uh

672
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,080
application was signed from july 11.

673
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,679
so i think we think this campaign

674
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,919
started much before and then they got

675
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,080
the plc from ios they said let's go on

676
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,880
this

677
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,679
and they attack the ios as well uh at

678
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,799
this point

679
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,360
at the point that we're working on so we

680
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,360
we managed to get the uh so then drive

681
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:51,919
also

682
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,080
version was uh skate it was packed with

683
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,520
very known packs so we didn't pack it

684
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,039
and we executed them

685
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,720
and the application we got though we'd

686
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,080
be able to get all the

687
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,440
uh all the uh cnc

688
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,799
uh cnc api called api endpoints names

689
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,440
from from there this is something that

690
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,320
uh

691
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,520
this is some of the information that the

692
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,559
device called

693
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,640
that this spike collect in the device

694
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,840
firewall and

695
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,840
device id brown model ios version

696
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,960
physical location

697
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,360
and sms information store the device as

698
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,039
well and before another interesting

699
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,960
functionality which is

700
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,880
a register to receive uh

701
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,440
in real time this is sms message from

702
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,640
the

703
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,880
from the device in real time is feedback

704
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,480
to the cnc server

705
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,520
so that is another

706
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,400
function i did i'm very fortunate as

707
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,840
well

708
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,360
so as a conclusion uh

709
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,440
we we present indicator here that the

710
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,799
campaign uh

711
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,559
so by some information that we have the

712
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,320
campaign statements five

713
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,520
fifth in november and uh

714
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,880
for us it's clear that attack uh was

715
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,799
starting for a while already so it was

716
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,919
planned ahead

717
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,200
and was a design

718
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,360
ahead of time and was very well planned

719
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,400
and very well

720
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,880
organized is her opinion so we didn't

721
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,000
find any actual

722
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,880
zero day in this attack but uh

723
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,159
but we think that uh our opinion they

724
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,320
don't have access to zero data they will

725
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,039
try to cover

726
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,720
they try to go at the maximum possible

727
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,559
version in the us case

728
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,320
that was possible all the time at the

729
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,080
time with the known police staff

730
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,640
you that you can find and the attack at

731
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,679
the end of the day was

732
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,440
targeting parts device and

733
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,960
and that that was the way that they

734
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,480
operated so the last

735
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,880
uh last bite as by where it was has

736
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,120
evolved the same and was very well

737
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,200
organized by the league progress

738
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,400
structure we think that

739
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,240
multiple pro multiple developers were

740
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,480
working on that i can show one slide

741
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,919
after this we chose some some cases

742
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,799
of the prior structure we think that

743
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,640
multiple is very we're working on

744
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,200
but we didn't find any information of

745
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,279
this campaign that was having financial

746
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,559
interest

747
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,960
so you can draw your own conclusion for

748
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,600
that

749
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,279
as a final bonus slide we

750
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,760
posted here in the light deck that some

751
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,520
interesting path that you can find that

752
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,320
they like

753
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,159
in the code and bunch of api

754
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,880
as well so we have two bonus slides that

755
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,159
you can look at

756
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,919
because we don't have more time for

757
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:46,880
for first place thank you very much
