00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,560
welcome i'm joe levy cto of cephus

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,319
i'd like to thank virus bulletin and the

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,680
cyber threat alliance for this

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,360
opportunity to share some thoughts with

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,240
you today

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,759
on the topic of collaborating with

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,320
competitors

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,160
to say that a security professionals we

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,920
should share more threat intelligence

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,800
would be both platitudinous and true it

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,080
would be a platitude because

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,160
admonishments to share intelligence date

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,840
back to at least the morris worm of

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,599
1988.

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,359
we have made significant progress since

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,760
then and more admonishments are unlikely

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,960
to help

18
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,640
and it would be true because there's

19
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,320
overwhelming evidence that sharing

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,520
beyond our current levels

21
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,280
could protect thousands of exposed

22
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,360
organizations from reach

23
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,440
yet despite the seemingly clear benefits

24
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,120
of threat intelligence sharing to beat

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,399
adversaries

26
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,920
our efforts at creating new threat

27
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,680
sharing standards and coalitions

28
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,280
haven't yielded the game-changing

29
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,399
benefits they promise

30
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,280
we still face a variety of obstacles

31
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,680
including but not limited to

32
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,760
market disincentives to sharing even

33
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,319
among fully bought in sharers

34
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,080
privacy concerns related to the

35
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,240
information being shared

36
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,000
and inefficiencies in building the

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,840
requisite trust relationships among

38
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,159
sharers

39
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,640
thus we must continue to ask and ask

40
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,520
again

41
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,280
how do we move the needle on sharing

42
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,880
timely high quality

43
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,119
and sometimes organizationally sensitive

44
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,080
intelligence

45
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,920
to better ensure the security of

46
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,640
internet dependent societies

47
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,240
this talk will introduce three

48
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,159
provocations designed to help us think

49
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:32,720
differently

50
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,880
and disruptively about these old and

51
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,439
seemingly intractable problems

52
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,600
the first is to accept that the barriers

53
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,520
to sharing are in the staying power of

54
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,560
game equilibria

55
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,200
between self-interested parties and that

56
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,119
only by changing the incentive structure

57
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,000
of the game

58
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,520
will we align interests and

59
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,759
significantly increase sharing

60
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,000
indeed vendor share because it's in

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
their mutual self-interest

62
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,360
trading off between the coalitional

63
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,520
advantages of pooled intelligence

64
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,200
and the risk of giving away competitive

65
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,560
advantage

66
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,840
breach victims trade off between the

67
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,439
risk of embarrassment

68
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,679
information leakage and legal liability

69
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,480
in their threat sharing decision making

70
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,560
the patterns we enact have names for

71
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,640
example tit for tat and prisoner's

72
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,680
dilemma

73
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,280
and could be understood as strategies

74
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,879
and games no different than those we

75
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,080
observe in economies and nature

76
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,000
the second provocation i'll introduce

77
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,440
flowing from the first

78
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,440
is a call to immerse ourselves in the

79
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,519
new technologies and privacy preserving

80
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,280
data sharing that other fields

81
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,440
such as biology and medical research are

82
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,879
already using

83
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,239
and that have been shown to change the

84
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,319
matrix of self-interest we are locked in

85
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,680
for the better

86
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,440
these technologies include differential

87
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,040
privacy which affords

88
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,560
optimized trade-offs between the

89
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,400
fidelity of shared information

90
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,599
and its anonymity homomorphic encryption

91
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,120
which affords cryptographically

92
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,720
principled guarantees

93
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,640
around the privacy properties of shared

94
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,159
information

95
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,080
and federated learning which allows

96
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,920
organizations to train machine learning

97
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,200
models jointly without sharing data

98
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,120
deft adoption of new technologies from

99
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,280
outside fields could unleash enormous

100
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,120
computer network defense capabilities

101
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,319
for our community

102
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,239
by changing the parameters of the threat

103
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,159
sharing game

104
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,760
the third provocation the talk will

105
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
introduce is based on the empirical

106
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,680
experience of three new information

107
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,040
sharing formations

108
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,560
that occurred in the aftermath of the

109
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,400
covet lockdowns

110
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,879
the covet 19 cyber threat coalition or

111
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,319
cctc

112
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,280
the cti league and cyber volunteers or

113
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,720
cd 19

114
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,280
which saw new spontaneous partly

115
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,120
organizationally motivated

116
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,040
and partly individually motivated

117
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,159
coalitions between

118
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,959
i.t security professionals vendors

119
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,000
government agencies

120
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
and journalists emerge focusing on the

121
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,120
experience of the cctc

122
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,040
we'll discuss the organization's balance

123
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,360
sheet as a kind of natural experiment

124
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,360
in the role a global crisis in new

125
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,599
collaboration technologies can play

126
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,840
in kicking apart ossified modalities

127
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,040
around sharing

128
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,400
drawing lessons for the future let's get

129
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,879
started

130
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,439
as i stated a few moments ago threat

131
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,280
sharing entities are self-interested

132
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,640
agents that share out of that

133
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,920
self-interest

134
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,639
indeed security companies that compete

135
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,798
sometimes ruthlessly with each other

136
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,880
in the market also share with each other

137
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
under some conditions

138
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,639
enterprises that would much prefer to

139
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,240
hide breach activity in fact

140
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,880
share detailed evidence of such activity

141
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,560
under some conditions

142
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,680
and governments that can be

143
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,240
geopolitically share threat information

144
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,639
under some conditions none of these

145
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,600
share enough

146
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,280
when they do share they share out of

147
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,800
shrewd calculation

148
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,639
and true calculation is what we should

149
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,880
expect of them based on the status quo

150
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,520
of today's current threat sharing model

151
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,440
the key implication of what i'm saying

152
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,600
is that we are unlikely to further

153
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
improve sharing simply through ongoing

154
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,000
appeals to the charity of organizations

155
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,400
whose raise on detroit is self-interest

156
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,520
be it profit

157
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,440
projection of national power and the

158
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,800
like

159
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,400
and it would be condescending and more

160
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,240
importantly wrong

161
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,080
to assume that organizations aren't

162
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,160
already sharing as much and as little as

163
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,479
in their calculated self-interest

164
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,800
rather our task is to understand the

165
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,240
game these agents are playing when

166
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,080
making choices or setting protocol

167
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,440
around sharing

168
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
and then to identify leverage points

169
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,560
that will cause them to make the

170
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,720
rational choice to share more

171
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,800
just as economists approach the behavior

172
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,160
of firms

173
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,080
we may be less familiar with analyzing

174
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,000
cyber threat sharing in this way

175
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,960
which makes it all the more important as

176
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,960
a way into this analysis then

177
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,199
let's examine the matrix of incentives

178
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,240
disincentives

179
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,479
and behavioral equilibria that drive

180
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,199
threat information decisions

181
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,600
made by private enterprises security

182
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,440
vendors and governments

183
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,680
then we'll go on to discuss some game

184
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,160
dynamics that emerge from this matrix

185
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,319
finally we'll propose some interventions

186
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,520
let's walk through the matrix given here

187
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,720
as shown in the chart

188
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,800
private enterprises are incentivized to

189
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,720
share information within constructs like

190
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,520
isacs

191
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,360
or information sharing and analysis

192
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,919
centers to gain situational awareness

193
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,280
around threats affecting their

194
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,120
particular industry

195
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
governments are incentivized to provide

196
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,160
and receive information

197
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
that would help diminish cyber crime

198
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,080
increase their nation's security

199
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,560
find and punish bad actors and identify

200
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,960
regulatory non-compliance

201
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,520
finally vendors are incentivized to gain

202
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,560
intel that will help

203
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,880
better defend their customers as well as

204
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,720
to signal to analysts and prospective

205
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,280
buyers

206
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,880
through threat landscape reports and the

207
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,520
like they are competent

208
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,440
if threat intel sharing organizations

209
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,680
were merely driven by these incentives

210
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,680
we'd see far more widespread sharing

211
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,120
than we do

212
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,520
unfortunately organizations are also

213
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,240
strongly disincentivized from sharing

214
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,000
private enterprises are reticent to

215
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,680
share their most sensitive and timely

216
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,960
threat intelligence

217
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,720
because of the risk of reputational

218
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,000
damage from disclosing

219
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,919
exploited vulnerabilities and other

220
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,599
adversary network

221
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,479
activity on their networks this means

222
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,039
that their

223
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,520
equilibrium behavior cashes out as a

224
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,720
reticence to share

225
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,240
except in cases in which they are

226
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,720
legally required to disclose breaches

227
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,560
in which case they are incentivized to

228
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,319
open the books selectively

229
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,160
to signal competence to their markets

230
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,919
and shareholders

231
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,639
governments positioned very differently

232
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,880
have rigid national security protocols

233
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,560
that prevent sharing of the timeliest

234
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,199
information

235
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,960
pertaining to both their own and other

236
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
nation's cyber operations

237
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,039
making the intel they do share less

238
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,599
relevant or so past its prime that it's

239
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,919
less effective

240
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,319
they also embargo cyber information

241
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,400
related to criminal cases

242
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,240
meaning that their threat sharing often

243
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,319
cashes out as a vague public health

244
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,280
messaging

245
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,199
around best practices and aggregate

246
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,840
statistics on cybercrime

247
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,160
last but not least vendors are locked in

248
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,319
a white hot bind between relying heavily

249
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,440
on threat sharing

250
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,759
but also investing significant resources

251
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,599
and threat intelligence generation as a

252
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,280
competitive advantage

253
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,520
and constantly calibrate and recalibrate

254
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,199
how much information they'll share

255
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,319
based on this trade-off

256
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,599
so far we've given a rough and static

257
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,800
picture of the actors

258
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,280
incentives disincentives and behaviors

259
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,759
in the threat information sharing game

260
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,680
now let's look at some of the game

261
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,759
theoretic dynamics of this system

262
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,440
that we see play out again and again

263
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,360
over time of note

264
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,519
is that while single agent games allow

265
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,599
for the selection of an optimal strategy

266
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,799
based on maximizing an expected payoff

267
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,039
multiple agent games are more complex

268
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,120
because the best strategy relies on the

269
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,120
other agent's choices

270
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,959
these dynamics match those we see in

271
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,040
economies in ecosystems

272
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,360
international relations and anywhere

273
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,320
else complex

274
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,480
self-interested agents collaborate under

275
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,399
competition

276
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,320
the first concept we'll treat is called

277
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,800
a nash equilibrium

278
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,720
a nash equilibrium is the state a game

279
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,200
gets to when every player strategy is

280
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,279
optimal given the choices of the other

281
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,560
players

282
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,200
put more colloquially nash equilibria

283
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,240
are where games get

284
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,720
stuck where player strategies cease to

285
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,519
evolve because they appear to be optimal

286
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,440
it's worth noting that games can have

287
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,120
multiple equilibria

288
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,120
and can very well get stuck in positions

289
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,959
that are at the best equilibria

290
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,440
as measured by the aggregate payoff that

291
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,839
the game's players are receiving

292
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,360
you can see why this concept is

293
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,519
pertinent to this talk because i do

294
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,800
believe that we're stuck

295
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,720
in cyber threat sharing practices that

296
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
are not globally optimal

297
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,160
although there's some evidence that we

298
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
could become unstuck very soon

299
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,680
which we'll get to in a few moments

300
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,000
tit for tat is a game dynamic in which

301
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,120
actors ratchet up

302
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,360
altruism as a function of reputational

303
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,279
models they build their peers

304
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,600
rewarding others with collaboration is a

305
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,880
function of their demonstrated

306
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,480
trustworthiness

307
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
a poignant example of tit-for-tat is

308
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,000
given in this image of russian and

309
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,200
german soldiers

310
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,120
hanging out in no man's land during

311
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,800
world war one

312
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
folklore said that in some but not all

313
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,880
regions of the european trenches

314
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,800
soldiers yelled across barbed wire

315
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,720
volunteering to take a peaceful step in

316
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,240
the other group's direction

317
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,600
until they were fraternizing in the

318
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,160
middle trustworthy units found each

319
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,480
other

320
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,680
and got some reprieve from the

321
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,720
atrocities of war untrustworthy units

322
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,279
shot up their prospective friends of

323
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,079
course

324
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,000
cyber sharing alliances are all about

325
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,120
tit-for-tat

326
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,040
and we take step towards and away from

327
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
each other as we test the possibility

328
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,320
we'll get burned

329
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,240
we've all likely had experiences with

330
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
both untrustworthy and trustworthy

331
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,519
situations within

332
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,680
our security community and we've all

333
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,079
played our own tit for tat games

334
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,720
overall actors in our space behave about

335
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,160
as you would expect

336
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
most develop sharing relationships with

337
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,360
trusted actors

338
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,959
and distance themselves from the

339
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,839
untrustworthy

340
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,720
the prisoner's dilemma is a well-known

341
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,040
game in which two actors are imprisoned

342
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,880
with no means of communicating with one

343
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,040
another and where the rules describe a

344
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
system of reward or punishment based on

345
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,480
the individual choices of

346
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,880
prisoners to either keep silent

347
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,000
cooperate

348
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,120
or betray the other defect let's look at

349
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,200
the following payoff matrix to describe

350
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,720
the game

351
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,120
if a and b cooperate they both get two

352
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,240
years in prison

353
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,399
represented by the negative two for a

354
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,240
loss of two years

355
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,120
if a cooperates and b defects a gets

356
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,839
four years

357
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,040
and b goes free if a defects and b

358
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,079
cooperates a goes free and b gets four

359
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,040
years

360
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,839
if a and b both defect both get three

361
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,600
years

362
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,920
in the game of prisoner's dilemma a nash

363
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,760
equilibrium is achieved when both

364
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,040
players defect

365
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,959
meaning they have no better strategy

366
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,639
given the other's choice

367
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,320
but this is not the best possible

368
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
outcome for the pair of them

369
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,639
the term for that is pareto efficiency

370
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,560
where no change in strategy could lead

371
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,959
to a better payoff for all parties

372
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,720
and it would be achieved with both

373
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,839
prisoners cooperating

374
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,079
another game called the stag hunt is

375
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,760
perhaps a more useful example to

376
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,560
illustrate

377
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,320
how there can be multiple equilibria

378
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,880
in the game of stag hunt two hunters who

379
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,200
like the prisoners cannot communicate

380
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,880
can either choose as their quarry the

381
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,120
one stag in the range or the two rabbits

382
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,320
in the range

383
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,800
the stag is worth 10 total food units

384
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,880
and rabbits are worth two food units

385
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,000
each

386
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
it takes both hunters cooperating to

387
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,360
take down a stag

388
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,040
so if one hunts it on their own they

389
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,360
will fail the rabbits are caught as a

390
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,560
pair

391
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,320
let's look at the payoff matrix to

392
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
describe the outcomes

393
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,200
if a and b cooperate to hunt the stag

394
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,360
they get five food units each

395
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,000
if a hunts the stag and b the rabbits a

396
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,959
gets nothing

397
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,760
and b gets four units if a hunts the

398
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,279
rabbits and b the stag

399
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,320
a gets four units and b gets nothing if

400
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,880
a and b

401
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,639
both hunt the rabbits both get two units

402
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,120
in this game we can see that both rabbit

403
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,839
rabbit

404
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,959
and stag stag are equilibria but it's

405
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,440
clear

406
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,320
that one is preferable to the other this

407
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,480
is a simple example of how games can get

408
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,959
stuck in local optima

409
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,720
it should be obvious that these games

410
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,560
provide models for the information

411
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
sharing dilemma between vendors

412
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,120
under at least some circumstances it

413
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
does not apply when vendors can

414
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,000
communicate easily

415
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,160
and have built-in trust relationships in

416
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,320
advance of a sharing scenario

417
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,839
but in competitive markets where

418
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,760
strategies can be opaque

419
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,680
or in fast-moving incidents in which

420
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,199
vendors haven't established the

421
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,519
necessary protections or trust

422
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,440
they face exactly the dilemma of the

423
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,760
prisoners or hunters in these games

424
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,680
and often choose to go it alone and

425
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,839
suffer rather than share sensitive

426
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,440
intelligence that would benefit them

427
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,760
both

428
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,760
free riding refers to cases where games

429
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,839
players engage in a sharing arrangement

430
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,440
only to have some number of players

431
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,199
contribute less than others

432
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,760
free riding off their labor one of the

433
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,199
best known examples of this

434
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,279
is the tragedy of the commons which

435
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,839
hypothesizes unregulated grazing on a

436
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,120
common pasture

437
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,079
often leading to collapse many of us

438
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,760
have watched freewriting play out in

439
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,760
contexts like virustotal

440
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,519
where some vendors who have contributed

441
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,600
their scanners to virustotals pool of

442
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,800
industry scanners

443
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,040
contribute very little actual detection

444
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,360
content and a relatively small group

445
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,800
contributes the lion's share of

446
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
detection content

447
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,959
free riding causes harm in two obvious

448
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,920
ways

449
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,320
first it limits the scope and diversity

450
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,440
of the intelligence

451
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,040
reducing the potential benefit to

452
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,360
consumers and second

453
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,279
free writing can destroy information

454
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,480
sharing coalitions

455
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,240
as the contributors contemplate the

456
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,920
rational decision to pull out

457
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,880
the game theoretic dynamics i have

458
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,720
listed only scratch the surface on the

459
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,800
complexity of what drives the dynamics

460
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,480
of the threat sharing problem

461
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,320
but they are sufficient to make my point

462
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,760
which is that

463
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,680
the dynamics of threat sharing have much

464
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,680
in common with core ideas within the

465
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,000
game theoretic analysis of cooperation

466
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,199
under competition this suggests

467
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,120
that we can change these dynamics by

468
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,880
understanding sharing as a game

469
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,440
and finding its leverage points that is

470
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,040
the game parameters that would lead to

471
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
more and better sharing

472
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,720
once we have identified promising

473
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
leverage points we need fresh ideas

474
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,040
about how to actually apply pressure

475
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,480
and this could take the form of new

476
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,560
technologies or new social

477
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,479
organizational ideas around coalition

478
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,079
building

479
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,560
so where are the leverage points i would

480
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
offer a few points with a caveat that

481
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,480
this is as much an inducement to further

482
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,240
analysis within our community

483
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,160
as it is a finished set of theses one

484
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,079
privacy preserving threat information

485
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,600
sharing is a key lever

486
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,680
because if enterprises could share host

487
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,839
and network security data without fear

488
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,600
of de-anonymizing themselves

489
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,079
or revealing sensitive information

490
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,920
they'd be less disincentivized from

491
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,199
sharing

492
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,839
two agreed upon measurements of threat

493
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,920
intelligence quality is a key lever

494
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,160
because it could help identify and then

495
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,839
eliminate free riders from the threat

496
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,199
sharing commons

497
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,040
thereby ensuring the viability and

498
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,800
growth of these comments

499
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,399
and three new collaboration technologies

500
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,880
like inter-organization slack workspaces

501
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,360
telepresence technologies and the like

502
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,040
could accelerate the construction of

503
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,120
reputational networks once bottlenecked

504
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,040
by email and in-person reputation

505
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,360
building thereby ratcheting up tit for

506
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,160
tat games

507
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,480
and resulting in more and more robust

508
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,519
trust relationships

509
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,480
now let's discuss how we might move the

510
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
levers i've just identified

511
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,320
starting with a discussion of privacy

512
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,759
preserving technologies

513
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,920
which promised to facilitate information

514
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,560
sharing with less associated risk

515
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,320
moving on to a discussion of the role of

516
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,160
metrics in reducing free writing and

517
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,839
information sharing comments

518
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,439
such that these comments continue to

519
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,039
flourish and grow

520
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,720
in concluding with a discussion of the

521
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,400
surprising role that twitter

522
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,640
linkedin slack zoom and other new

523
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,559
collaboration technologies seem to be

524
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,280
playing

525
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,520
in densifying reputational networks

526
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,799
within the threat

527
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,319
information sharing community

528
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,160
privacy preserving technologies may

529
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,760
allow us to change the information

530
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,840
sharing game by mitigating disincentives

531
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,039
to sharing

532
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,520
differential privacy is one category of

533
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,160
privacy preserving technologies

534
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,200
here's the basic idea suppose i'm a ceo

535
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
of an enterprise and a government agency

536
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
comes to me asking my company to share

537
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,280
anonymous statistical information

538
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,039
on the number of times we've discovered

539
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,799
adversaries on our network in the past

540
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,360
year

541
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,960
and the failures on our end that allow

542
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,200
these adversaries to succeed

543
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,120
suppose they'd also like to record how

544
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,400
many employees we have

545
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
what industry we're in our annual

546
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,080
revenue and where our company

547
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,880
offices are located clearly i'd be

548
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,720
disinclined to share this information

549
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,240
for fair that it would easily be

550
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,280
de-anonymized

551
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,919
leading to bad press fleeing customers

552
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,840
and reduced revenue

553
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,600
differential privacy approaches are

554
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,240
designed to mitigate the risk of

555
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,120
de-anonymization

556
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,039
while differential privacy approaches

557
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,280
vary they turn on the idea that by

558
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,200
carefully adding random noise to my

559
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,000
report

560
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,880
measured by some parameter epsilon i can

561
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,400
reduce the chances that i can be

562
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,679
de-anonymized

563
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,200
all while keeping my reports

564
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,039
statistically relevant to other

565
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,720
organizations that may benefit from

566
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,200
understanding the threat landscape

567
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
the good news about differential privacy

568
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,880
models for information sharing is that

569
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,200
they're

570
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,440
already proven in use in fields outside

571
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,799
of cyber security

572
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,520
like medical research smart power grids

573
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,559
traffic planning

574
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,679
and even the 2020 united states census

575
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,440
differential privacy is not merely

576
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,600
theoretical it's a proven method for

577
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,000
sharing

578
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,880
information under privacy constraints

579
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,840
the bad news

580
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,360
is that we're behind in adopting

581
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,679
differential privacy and cyber security

582
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,520
given what a powerful tool it could be

583
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,679
in reducing the disincentives to report

584
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,160
truthful robust information about what

585
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,080
incursions enterprises are discovering

586
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,799
on their networks

587
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,960
homomorphic encryption is another

588
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,720
privacy preserving technology which

589
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,640
could change the cyber information

590
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,080
sharing game

591
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,400
homomorphic encryption allows me for

592
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,200
example

593
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,039
to compute a machine learning model

594
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,880
inference on data that you provide

595
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,480
without knowing anything about the

596
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
nature of the data that you've provided

597
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,120
or the machine learning model's result

598
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,880
i'll repeat that because it's so

599
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,760
counter-intuitive homomorphic encryption

600
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,600
allows you to send me some data

601
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,080
have me run my own computation on it and

602
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,600
send you the result

603
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,440
all without me knowing anything about

604
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,039
your data

605
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,880
thanks to both moore's law and

606
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,559
mathematical innovation

607
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,400
homomorphic encryption has recently

608
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,320
become practical to use in the real

609
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,280
world

610
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,440
its implications for cyber information

611
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,679
sharing should be clear

612
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,360
say you have a machine learning model

613
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,120
trained to detect malicious emails

614
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,559
observed on your network

615
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,080
and i have a machine learning model

616
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,919
trained to detect malicious emails i've

617
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,360
observed on my network

618
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,600
and we'd like to trade so that i can run

619
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,120
my emails through your model

620
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,799
and you can run your emails through my

621
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,320
model

622
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,799
of course we'd never make such a deal if

623
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,240
we knew that it meant we could read each

624
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,679
other's emails

625
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,760
homomorphic encryption solves this and

626
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,679
many other sharing problems

627
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,200
eliminating the need for slow

628
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,120
tit-for-tat ramp-ups and sharing

629
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,280
relationships by eliminating the privacy

630
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,720
risks

631
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
the third promising technology worth

632
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
mentioning here is federated machine

633
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,760
learning

634
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,280
in the federated machine learning

635
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,200
paradigm supposing you and i are

636
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,400
enterprises

637
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,320
we train machine learning models on our

638
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,240
own data fusing those models

639
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,760
mathematically as we go

640
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,520
into a hybrid model that contains

641
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,679
detection information contained in both

642
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,600
of our training databases

643
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,760
even while we have revealed none of the

644
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,600
data points in our databases to one

645
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,720
another

646
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,559
federated learning holds the promise of

647
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,320
lowering information privacy

648
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,159
disincentives to sharing in the threat

649
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,360
sharing game

650
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,200
while offering the benefits of detection

651
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,880
pipelines which benefit from

652
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,760
crowdsourced

653
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,480
private data

654
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,360
privacy concerns are not the only

655
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,200
disincentive to cyber information

656
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,000
sharing

657
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,480
as mentioned above dishonest actors free

658
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,080
riding on the threat intelligence work

659
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,360
of honest peers

660
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,440
is a disincentive for those honest peers

661
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,240
to participate in sharing coalitions

662
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,799
to tackle this disincentive we need

663
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,559
means to measure threat intelligence

664
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,720
quality so that we can reward actors for

665
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,880
sharing high quality information

666
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
and punish actors who share low quality

667
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,000
information

668
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,919
of course measuring the quality of

669
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,080
threat intelligence is a hard problem

670
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,080
but solving it does not require magic

671
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
was exemplified by the work of the cyber

672
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,200
threat alliance

673
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
vendor sharing coalition which has

674
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,720
developed methods for scoring

675
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,799
contributions of coalition members to

676
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,039
discourage free writing

677
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,960
as a member of the cyber threat alliance

678
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,640
we receive weekly data sharing

679
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
statistics that describe the overall

680
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,760
submission count

681
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,480
for each observable by type ip address

682
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,039
domain

683
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,080
uri file hash mutex etc

684
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,919
and submission counts by each of the

685
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,159
nearly 30 member companies

686
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,320
the cta themselves perform internal

687
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,080
quality measurements on the submitted

688
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,039
observables

689
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,720
and they give feedback to the member

690
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,480
companies on how they're doing relative

691
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,679
to the group

692
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,080
as you would expect there is variance

693
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,760
and the feedback helps us to calibrate

694
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,039
our efforts

695
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,840
as a member company cephos also perform

696
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,600
our own quality measurements on the data

697
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
that we receive from the cta and other

698
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,960
sharing groups in which we participate

699
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,640
if the data match intelligence we

700
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,640
already have we regard it as

701
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,600
confirmatory

702
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,720
and it serves to strengthen convictions

703
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,200
if the data are novel we perform varying

704
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,960
levels of validation to ensure its

705
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,320
fitness for introduction

706
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,039
into our user population influenced by

707
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,480
among other factors

708
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
the trustworthiness or reputation of the

709
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,760
source

710
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,440
errors in threaded intelligence can be

711
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,679
very expensive both for the consumer

712
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,080
in terms of operational cost and for the

713
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,880
producer

714
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,919
in terms of reputational costs game

715
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,280
theoretic innovations

716
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,200
also holds promise in helping to

717
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,880
discourage free riding

718
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,799
for example while not addressing the

719
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,720
free writing problem directly

720
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,120
a new malware detection startup

721
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,240
polyswarm

722
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,080
has created a kind of prediction market

723
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,280
for malware detection

724
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,039
in which those who contribute are

725
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,640
rewarded for making true positive

726
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,520
detections

727
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,000
and punished false positives with nash

728
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
equilibria emerging around actors

729
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,400
converging on high signal detections

730
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,320
such that actors develop individual

731
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,720
niches in the threat landscape

732
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,880
such market design approaches sidestep

733
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,039
the problem of the commons entirely

734
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,720
and are a promising alternative to

735
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,799
coalition formations that do present

736
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,559
this problem

737
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,799
finally it's worth mentioning that

738
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,400
organizations don't only share

739
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,760
intelligence proper

740
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,840
they also share detection content like

741
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,520
signatures and increasingly

742
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,240
machine learning models such content are

743
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,919
actually predictive models

744
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,159
which codify hypothesis about which

745
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,480
previously unseen artifacts

746
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,159
will turn out to be malicious when

747
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,559
placed under human scrutiny

748
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,240
the statistics in machine learning

749
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,760
literature provide methods for

750
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
validating predictive models in terms of

751
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,799
their quality

752
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,200
such as cross-validation and we should

753
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,120
employ these in assessing the quality of

754
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,520
rule

755
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,080
and ml based detection content shared

756
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,840
within threat sharing coalitions

757
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,360
to discourage free writing

758
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,240
not all technological opportunities for

759
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,159
changing the cyber threat information

760
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,840
sharing game involves statistics

761
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,720
cryptography

762
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,799
and machine learning some involve

763
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,880
collaboration technologies that enable

764
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,000
densification of

765
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,840
professional social networks and

766
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,760
optimization of the flow of information

767
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,600
along these pathways

768
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,919
twitter and linkedin have for instance

769
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,520
changed the parameters of the threat

770
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,440
sharing game by allowing ad-hoc

771
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,080
coalitions to form and zoom slack and

772
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,520
microsoft teams

773
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,520
have emerged as game-changing enablers

774
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,440
to help these coalitions quickly stand

775
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,840
up communications platforms

776
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,840
take for example the formation of the

777
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,240
kovitt 19 cyber threat coalition

778
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,320
in the midst of the global covet 19

779
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,240
lockdown starting in march

780
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,080
when a wave of covet-themed cyber

781
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,159
attacks became prominent and visible

782
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,039
in global cyber attack trends joshua

783
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:23,679
sachs

784
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,559
chief scientist at cephas initiated this

785
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,720
coalition by sending single tweet

786
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,000
shown here when josh posted this tweet

787
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,480
he assumed no one would respond six

788
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,360
months later

789
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,600
the cctc has more than four thousand

790
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,720
participants

791
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,120
has received international news coverage

792
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,120
has garnered the participation of global

793
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,799
law enforcement organizations

794
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,360
cyber security vendors i.t security

795
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,240
departments

796
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,640
and mutual defense organizations and

797
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,000
most importantly

798
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,760
has stood up infrastructure that has

799
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
protected users from cyber attacks

800
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,600
millions of times

801
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,360
they're building and enduring commons

802
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,120
for the community to leverage in times

803
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,240
of crisis

804
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,440
and are close to achieving

805
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,840
not-for-profit status under the auspices

806
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,000
of the mature consortium of vendors

807
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,039
cyber threat alliance

808
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,480
linking all this back to our game

809
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,480
theoretic frame for understanding cyber

810
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,080
information sharing

811
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,559
in the creation of the cctc actors

812
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,799
played thousands of proy's tit-for-tat

813
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,720
reputation building games

814
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,400
and played them much faster than they

815
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,640
could have in a pre-social networked

816
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,440
pre-collaboration platform age building

817
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,039
sharing links at the pace of slack

818
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,720
messages and zoom meetings

819
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,159
having never met before also due to the

820
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,080
dense network structure of the coalition

821
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,720
slack beehive it quickly identified and

822
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
demoted individuals and organizations

823
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,559
who were free riding on the coalition's

824
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,200
efforts

825
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,640
to sell products or bolster their

826
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,960
marketing and they promoted members who

827
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,480
were trustworthy and productive

828
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,600
contributors into leadership positions

829
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,000
as i suggested above we should consider

830
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,960
the emergence of

831
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,880
informational professional networks like

832
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,159
slack and linkedin

833
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,320
and cloud collaboration tools like slack

834
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,640
and zoom

835
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,799
as we think about ways to change the

836
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:07,760
game dynamics

837
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,440
of cyber information sharing

838
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,640
earlier i stated that the industry

839
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,559
generally recognizes the benefits of

840
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,840
intelligence sharing

841
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,440
and that further admonishments are no

842
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,520
longer needed or helpful

843
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,600
i base this on countless conversations

844
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,520
with security operators and vendors in

845
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,559
the industry

846
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,480
on the emergence and widespread adoption

847
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,919
of such standards as

848
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,120
sticks as a common data format and on

849
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,960
the increasing levels of participation

850
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,640
in such sharing structures

851
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,640
as the sector-specific information

852
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,600
sharing and analysis centers isacs

853
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,760
sector agnostic information sharing and

854
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,200
analysis organizations

855
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,240
isles and on non-profits such as the

856
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,240
cyber threat alliance

857
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,120
we really are getting better but despite

858
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,960
such clear evidence of progress over the

859
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,360
past

860
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,919
20 years we can still succumb to the

861
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:58,640
blind man

862
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,720
and the elephant effect where we

863
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,120
concededly find absolute truth

864
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,799
in our subjective experiences

865
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,760
in a study published this past august at

866
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,320
the 29th usmix security symposium

867
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,880
titled a different cup of tea the added

868
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,120
value of commercial threat intelligence

869
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,080
by bowman italia the researchers

870
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,000
analyzed the extent to which threat

871
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,520
intelligence from two leading

872
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,679
private threat intelligence companies

873
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,120
overlapped with each other

874
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,039
as well as with four open source threat

875
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,720
intelligence providers

876
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,000
and they found that there is almost no

877
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,039
overlap between

878
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,600
paid and open ti sources signaling that

879
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,120
they capture a different part of the

880
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,559
threat landscape

881
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,640
surprisingly there is also little

882
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,200
overlap among the two paid feeds

883
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,960
although they focus on the same topic

884
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,000
areas even when tracking the same 22

885
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,120
thread actors

886
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,120
only two and a half to four percent of

887
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,600
indicators are found by both vendors

888
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,760
depending on the type of indicator

889
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,880
timeliness

890
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,039
as measured on the small overlap among

891
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:01,919
sources

892
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,679
shows delays of more than a month

893
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,399
between sources

894
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,960
a further state the feeds are highly

895
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,240
heterogeneous

896
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,880
overlap among any two feeds is often

897
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,679
very small

898
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,480
and never more than 10 and the feeds are

899
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,399
dominated by singletons

900
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,880
entries that do not appear in any other

901
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,240
feeds

902
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,559
this also explains why in order to

903
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,480
achieve better coverage of their threats

904
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,240
network defenders combine on average 7.7

905
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,600
threat intelligence sources

906
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,320
and the study concludes the current

907
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,919
state of affairs and paid threat

908
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,840
intelligence resembles the market for

909
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840
anti-phishing services about a decade

910
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,640
ago

911
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,799
the lack of data sharing meant that each

912
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,080
anti-phishing company

913
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,240
thought it had strong coverage and could

914
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,080
protect its clients brands well

915
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,159
while the truth was that they missed

916
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,919
most of the attacks they were hired to

917
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,120
detect

918
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,200
in that market like in the market of

919
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,640
malware detection

920
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,880
sharing across vendors was eventually

921
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,559
recognized as a superior

922
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,679
security strategy until that happens for

923
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,360
commercial threat intelligence

924
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,200
the problem of information sharing

925
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,840
persists

926
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,919
let's consider some of the possible

927
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,440
takeaways from this

928
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,600
first it confirms that over the course

929
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,520
of the past two decades

930
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,679
the industry has become quite proficient

931
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,679
at sharing certain very important types

932
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,039
of threat intelligence

933
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,440
namely file based malware and phishing

934
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,640
websites

935
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,320
this suggests both the spirit of

936
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,000
openness and cooperation

937
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,919
among customers and vendors who jointly

938
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,080
work to produce this intelligence

939
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,320
as well as an ever-improving ability for

940
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,440
the industry to share

941
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,679
vast amounts of information both

942
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,159
economically and practically

943
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,840
if we consider these the low-hanging

944
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,520
fruit of threat intelligence

945
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,520
and that they are demonstrably solved by

946
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,120
existing automation

947
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,039
it means that we can now begin shifting

948
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,720
our attentions to the more complex

949
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,679
observables

950
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,399
such as behaviors tactics techniques and

951
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,399
procedures or ttps

952
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,840
and other contextually oriented forms of

953
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,200
intelligence we are ready to graduate to

954
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,279
the next stage

955
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,360
second it confirms that consumers of

956
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,039
threat intelligence recognize that

957
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,120
single sourcing their threat intel

958
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,880
even from vendors with the strongest

959
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,720
reputations in the industry

960
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,480
does not get them to their desired

961
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,919
outcomes

962
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,159
a pessimistic interpretation is that

963
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,919
thread intel consumers are blindly

964
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,159
trying to reduce their risk

965
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,919
while an optimistic interpretation

966
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,679
implies an increasing ability among

967
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,760
consumers to both assess the value of

968
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,440
the threat until they're buying

969
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,360
and to put them intel to productive use

970
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,000
finally it confirms that no one producer

971
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,519
of threat intelligence can ever

972
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,799
reasonably claim

973
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,279
any kind of comprehensiveness let alone

974
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,799
omniscience when it comes to threat

975
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,159
intelligence

976
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,760
vendors who project that they are the

977
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,320
ordained keepers of the sacred knowledge

978
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,159
should probably be treated with the same

979
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,159
skepticism as those who make such

980
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,760
dubious claims as

981
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,559
zero false positives or perfect security

982
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,039
let me wrap up by summarizing the ideas

983
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,960
we just explored

984
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,279
first threat intelligence sharing has

985
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,200
been steadily improving over the past 30

986
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,880
years

987
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,000
second despite these improvements there

988
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,399
are many

989
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,480
obstacles presenting preventing us from

990
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,840
doing better

991
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,080
mainly related to issues of incentives

992
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,399
privacy and trust

993
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,960
third that there isn't an oligopoly let

994
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,279
alone a monopoly on threat intelligence

995
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,760
as proud as we are of what we produce

996
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,200
our mindset should be

997
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,039
that we each possess just a piece of the

998
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,480
puzzle

999
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,799
fourth that is operators in cyber

1000
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,519
security

1001
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,919
we should compete on technology business

1002
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,679
and government innovations

1003
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,200
not by ordering threat intelligence

1004
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,360
this talk proposed that we can continue

1005
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,440
our progress in a few ways

1006
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,919
one by applying principles and learnings

1007
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,679
from game theory that teach us how we

1008
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:56,000
might

1009
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,559
achieve optimally efficient outcomes by

1010
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,080
cooperating within competitive

1011
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,360
frameworks

1012
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,000
two by employing the latest advancements

1013
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
in privacy preserving technologies

1014
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,760
that will allow us to share information

1015
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,200
relatively freely

1016
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,960
while minimizing the risks typically

1017
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,840
associated with such disclosures

1018
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,320
and three by leveraging collaborative

1019
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,760
technologies to quickly and

1020
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,039
inexpensively develop

1021
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,519
new trust and organizational structures

1022
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,519
uniting the efforts of experts across

1023
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,679
industries sectors companies countries

1024
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,399
finally let's maintain the conviction

1025
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,840
that as an industry

1026
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,080
we can achieve lasting impactful change

1027
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,240
by embracing the african proverb

1028
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,120
if you want to go quickly go alone but

1029
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,720
if you want to go far

1030
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,679
go together thank you
