1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,840
hello

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,320
i'm dr monica lopez and i'm the ceo and

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,719
chief science art officer of lepitinos

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:15,759
productions

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,440
and today i'm going to talk about

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,119
transparency trust

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,760
and intention what dismantling the heart

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,600
of cyber attack public attribution

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,480
reveals

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,119
about warring minds as i will be

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,039
discussing the importance of developing

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,279
a cognitive model of mindsets

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,880
from both the attackers and defenders

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,960
perspectives in addressing the major

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,280
problem with cyber attack attribution

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,520
and public attribution no less i'd like

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,680
to start with an assertion the famed

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,440
fictional detective sherlock holmes

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,000
makes

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,680
to his colleague dr watson

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,920
how often have i said to you that when

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,079
you have eliminated the impossible

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,039
whatever remains however improbable must

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,280
be the truth

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,879
whether you've read the sign of for a

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,199
story or not you can imagine that

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,039
sherlock and watson are examining a

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:03,600
crime

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,000
scene as they search for the perpetrator

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,479
seemingly magical mode of entry

31
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,439
granted it's impossible to eliminate the

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,560
impossible

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,680
but what's key here is sherlock's point

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,920
about inference to the best explanation

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,479
in crime sloothing

36
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,720
it is critical to identify as many

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,200
alternative hypotheses as possible

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,280
because such detective work will lead to

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,880
an objective solution

40
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,360
the truth and not a subjective

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,159
impression

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,640
tainted by bias like a predetermined

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,079
expectation

44
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,560
certainly easier said than done after

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,200
all

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,840
we're human and by definition filled

47
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,280
with biases

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,040
which brings us to the cyber attack

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,479
attribution problem

50
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,920
we all know that in this world of

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,520
malicious cyber events

52
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,159
attackers can achieve a high degree of

53
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,680
digital anonymity

54
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,399
and frankly their origins and intentions

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,759
are not reducible to lines of code

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,000
what this entails is that the process of

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,399
attribution is a multi-layered web of

58
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,960
hypotheses built on interpretations upon

59
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,160
interpretations

60
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,720
of both technical evidence like zero-day

61
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,640
exploits fake personas

62
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,680
ip addresses and domain names and

63
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,720
non-technical evidence the financial

64
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,239
ideological and geopolitical motivations

65
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,239
and then when interpretations of

66
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,280
culpability

67
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,760
enter into open discourse with or

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,720
without clear

69
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
and overt evidence and complete with

70
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,560
geopolitical consequences that are

71
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,040
equally

72
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,239
good bad or unknown public announcement

73
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,879
then becomes a hotbed of debate

74
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,560
what's more there is no

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,640
institutionalized mechanism or set of

76
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,879
mechanisms in place at the international

77
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,840
level for how

78
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,760
when and who ought to decide on and make

79
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,000
a statement of public attribution

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,160
and some even go as far as questioning

81
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,319
if attribution is even a plausible

82
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,720
activity given the difficulty of

83
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
accurately identifying the source

84
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,760
of a cyber intrusion what this means is

85
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,959
that we have a greater

86
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,440
tripartite psychological situation at

87
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,720
hand

88
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,080
and the first question is that of

89
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,480
transparency what is the nature of the

90
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,120
evidence

91
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
as parts and as a whole and what

92
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,360
constitutes robust and or enough

93
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,840
evidence for confident

94
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,080
attribution secondly the question of

95
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,959
trust

96
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,200
who do we as a nation-state and or set

97
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,879
of nation-states more globally

98
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,280
have confidence in for their attribution

99
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,480
capabilities

100
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,280
and thirdly the question of intent how

101
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,120
strong is the correlation

102
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
if suitable between digital fingerprints

103
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,959
of behavior and mental states of

104
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,080
premeditation

105
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,720
and deliberateness of an individual a

106
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,080
group of individuals

107
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,879
and or a state more broadly as a

108
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,239
cognitive scientist

109
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,040
what i find so crucially problematic

110
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
with cyber attack attribution

111
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,680
is that it is so rightly problematic

112
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,480
because

113
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,640
it essentially asks and then takes

114
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,400
action upon the answering of a

115
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,680
fundamental question

116
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,560
of the black box problem of the human

117
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,840
mind brain

118
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,120
how why and does actos reos

119
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,239
or pattern of actions result from and or

120
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,120
lead to

121
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,238
man's ray or particular mental states

122
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,600
i mentioned that i'm a cognitive

123
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,358
scientist and i'll take a quick

124
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,358
detour and say a bit about cognitive

125
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,280
science and why the integration

126
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,759
of this perspective is so critical to

127
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,160
addressing the attribution problem

128
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,840
for those of you who are not familiar

129
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,440
with the field you can think of the

130
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,040
discipline as the glue of many

131
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,919
disciplines

132
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,440
related to the understanding of the

133
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,040
human mind brain

134
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,199
found in the 1950s during the cognitive

135
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,160
revolution

136
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,000
cognitive science centers on the study

137
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,759
of the mind and its processes

138
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,479
and merges questions theories and

139
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,280
methods

140
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,080
from computer science psychology

141
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,120
philosophy

142
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,440
linguistics anthropology and

143
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,479
neuroscience

144
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,880
to understand human perception cognition

145
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,000
and fundamentally

146
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,880
reverse engineer the mind brain to

147
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,160
simplify the very

148
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,400
complex phenomenon of human perception

149
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,520
cognition

150
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,960
that is paradoxically so intuitive to us

151
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,520
the schematic drawing here illustrates

152
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,600
that we sense and perceive the world

153
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,280
and think and reason about what's

154
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,440
happening to move into action

155
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,680
think about it this way perceptual

156
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,520
information directly guides our

157
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,440
decisions and actions and shapes our

158
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,320
beliefs

159
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,880
just as internal knowledge of self

160
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,600
others

161
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,919
and the world influences the way we

162
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,680
perceive the world

163
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,600
this suggests that perception and

164
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,840
cognition are interdependent and we must

165
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,240
have a holistic understanding of

166
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,840
all of these elements to build a

167
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,440
satisfactory model

168
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,840
for why and how an individual or set of

169
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,320
individuals act the way they do

170
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,160
just consider how you navigate the world

171
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,240
from day to day and spontaneously

172
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,000
problem solve and adapt as you move

173
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,840
along through a constantly changing

174
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,080
environment and how that affects your

175
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,039
emotions

176
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,560
as much as emotions affect your actions

177
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,199
continuing down this line of thought we

178
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,880
cognitive brain and computational

179
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,680
scientists

180
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,520
have been and are currently grappling

181
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,039
with the following

182
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,759
we can with relative confidence identify

183
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,520
and experimentally control

184
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,280
the information that enters into our

185
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,919
sense organs or inputs

186
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,639
we can with relative confidence somewhat

187
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,360
characterize

188
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
internal cognitive symbols representing

189
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,120
the external environment

190
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,080
known as mental representations and we

191
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,240
can with relative confidence observe and

192
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,720
measure

193
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,440
internal and external behaviors that is

194
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,720
outputs

195
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,319
however we cannot yet fully describe and

196
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,120
explain

197
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,000
the mental processing that happens in

198
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,639
between

199
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,360
as it is implemented by neural tissue or

200
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,680
our brain

201
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,400
comparatively cyber attack attribution

202
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
and consequent public announcement

203
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,360
is under this perspective unwittingly a

204
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,919
partial

205
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,280
gesture of black box revelation with

206
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,240
in this case potential national security

207
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,360
and large-scale

208
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,199
geopolitical consequences we can with

209
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,120
relative confidence identify through

210
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,800
reverse engineering the tactics

211
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,720
techniques and procedures used by threat

212
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,039
actors for a particular incident

213
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,199
we can with relative confidence and

214
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,560
here's where much

215
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,280
of the argument begins to break down

216
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,000
correlate

217
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,759
such digital behavior with the

218
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,199
identified threat actors

219
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,360
past digital behavior in combination

220
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,039
with their target audience preferences

221
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,039
to determine their identity as well as

222
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,080
their presumed

223
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,520
geopolitical objectives but still

224
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,919
depending on the organization publicly

225
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:38,720
attributing

226
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,039
we cannot fully describe and explain the

227
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,080
data and methods

228
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,000
employed that made the attribution

229
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,319
possible

230
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,120
simply put delineation of actus rails

231
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,520
through forensic-based technical means

232
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,960
and perhaps even through human

233
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,879
intelligence means such as an informant

234
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,000
if available

235
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,160
leads to identification of a person or

236
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,199
organization

237
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,240
and men's real determination

238
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
but the link between behavior and mental

239
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,520
states is far more

240
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,840
complex than the result of a cause and

241
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,360
effect relationship

242
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,680
as is proving deliberateness beyond a

243
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,199
reasonable doubt

244
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,919
in fact determining the culprit can be

245
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,599
especially difficult when the situation

246
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,000
suggests state-sponsored involvement

247
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,080
i'm sure that most of us here would

248
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,919
acknowledge that even when a person has

249
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:24,240
been

250
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,680
clearly identified as being inside or a

251
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,879
citizen of the

252
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,080
attributed country it still may not be

253
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,039
definitively

254
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,799
clear from the forensics whether that

255
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,399
person is a contractor

256
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,559
or an employee operating at the behest

257
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,080
of their national government

258
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,799
or simply someone operating on their own

259
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,080
volition

260
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,440
non-digital clues become paramount

261
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,040
and matters are made even more

262
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,959
complicated when a particular entity

263
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:51,920
publicly

264
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,640
attributes remember attribution is about

265
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,279
identifying a narrative of

266
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,600
responsibility

267
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,000
for an action or set of actions that

268
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
have led to conflict or harm

269
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,279
in this case from cyber attacks

270
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,680
four entities can individually and or

271
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,120
collectively publicly

272
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,920
attribute a cyber attack the government

273
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,040
private industry

274
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,440
academia and anonymous vigilance and

275
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,600
journalist investigators

276
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
all three entities however have

277
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,680
different internal institutional

278
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,560
and or individual goals each are met

279
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,160
with different expectations by the

280
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,959
public

281
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,200
and each have varying degrees of power

282
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,880
and persuasion both nationally and

283
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,160
internationally

284
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,399
and as i mentioned earlier there are no

285
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,080
established international standards in

286
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,440
regards to the how

287
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,160
when and who of attribution so the door

288
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,519
remains open for each

289
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,720
entity to play by its own rules

290
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,920
while i will not go through all the

291
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,000
detailed reasons to attribute or not to

292
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,959
attribute

293
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,120
a summary breakdown of each entity will

294
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,160
underscore the array of motivations

295
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,720
in essence the government in a democracy

296
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,640
fundamentally has as its

297
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,440
role to be transparent in its methods

298
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,480
and motivations

299
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,120
with the public and has the clout to

300
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,800
prosecute offenders

301
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,200
the very same transparency however can

302
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,000
jeopardize

303
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,920
technical methods and practices and

304
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,480
national and foreign policy interests

305
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,399
in private industry where mass public

306
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,519
exposure equals

307
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,079
dollar signs and rapid growth of

308
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:20,800
customers

309
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,000
influence both production demand and

310
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,440
branding identity

311
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,279
attribution boils down to a balance

312
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,040
between profit gains

313
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,480
and customer satisfaction in academia

314
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,240
where its role in cyber attack

315
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,640
attribution is not yet entirely

316
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,240
established and only beginning to

317
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,360
gain traction attribution here will boil

318
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,440
down to both the breaking of academic

319
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,399
silos

320
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,760
and the maintenance at least in the

321
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
public's eye of academia's

322
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,240
general reputation in promoting rigorous

323
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,959
and honest

324
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,160
science as for anonymous vigilance and

325
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,839
journalist investigators in their

326
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,120
ultimate search

327
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,600
for truth they sit in a precarious

328
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,160
position

329
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,040
as they balance their moral convictions

330
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,880
and risk their livelihoods

331
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,560
and even lives now in dividing each

332
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,519
entity into

333
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,160
to a tribute and to not attribute i note

334
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,839
that they do not stand in opposition

335
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,000
from one another as in one or the other

336
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,040
categories

337
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,880
the dotted lines precisely suggest a

338
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,279
flexibility between factors

339
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,640
acknowledging of course the

340
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,160
decision-making regarding public

341
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,079
attribution is very much the result of a

342
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,760
combination of reasons

343
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,240
and attributing or not attributing is a

344
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,560
far more fluid process

345
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,959
however what this further highlights and

346
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:35,839
when many say

347
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,720
quote attribution is an art as much as a

348
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,279
science

349
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,760
unquote and given the fact that states

350
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,519
ultimately do as they wish in the

351
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,519
absence of established standards

352
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,240
we have an almost surrendering to the

353
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,800
volatility of perception

354
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,440
and thus we have a compounded problem

355
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,160
not only are unsteady correlations made

356
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,000
between patterns of actions

357
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,079
and particular mental states but the

358
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,079
public attribution of a cyber attack as

359
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,360
we discussed is further

360
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,279
laden with different entities choosing

361
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,720
as they deem fit why

362
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,200
how and when to identify a narrative of

363
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,639
responsibility

364
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,760
all of course indirectly or directly

365
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,360
influenced by the surrounding social

366
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
cultural landscape

367
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,519
now the devil's advocate could reply

368
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,200
well naturally

369
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,120
we're dealing with a system created by

370
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,040
humans for humans who have acquired

371
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,120
norms and beliefs through enculturation

372
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,200
and the unpredictability of the future

373
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,160
is a fact

374
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,959
so of course biases and ambiguity will

375
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,800
pervade throughout

376
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,639
and yet edmund lucard's exchange

377
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,079
principle about the physical

378
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,800
world is not for nothing it is

379
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,160
undeniable that every

380
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,120
contact leaves a trace even in the world

381
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,000
of the internet

382
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,399
where its very makeup lends itself to

383
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,600
anonymity

384
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,959
for which proposals for its

385
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,360
reengineering have been suggested

386
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,000
it does not preclude the fact that every

387
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,639
individual human behind a cyber attack

388
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,720
exists in the physical world as a result

389
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,200
something will be left behind as much as

390
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,000
something will

391
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,200
be transported away so in the absence

392
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,079
of microscopic hairs and fibers and with

393
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,120
the occlusion

394
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,440
and destruction of digital footprints

395
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,560
that something

396
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
found within the non-digital environment

397
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,680
requires

398
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,160
and acquires significant evidential

399
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,480
status

400
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,560
and a large part of the answer lies i

401
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,760
believe in rethinking cybersecurity r d

402
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,160
so how you may be asking well by making

403
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,000
a theoretical and cognitive analogy

404
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,920
between real-time improvisation and

405
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,440
adaptive problem solving

406
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,920
and the inventive threats perpetrated by

407
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
hackers as well as defenders predictive

408
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,440
creative problem solving

409
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,720
required to thwart and also

410
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,959
by integrating the r d work my company

411
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,560
has done on human creativity and

412
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,639
intelligence using the arts to precisely

413
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,639
develop a cognitive behavioral model of

414
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,760
spontaneous

415
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,680
real-time adaptability and decision

416
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,600
making

417
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,839
now let's look at an example in this

418
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,639
model here we have the following

419
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,800
using various productions of live

420
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
theater musical improvisation

421
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,120
our goal was to identify the wide

422
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,199
variety of factors such as complex

423
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,800
variables like emotion

424
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,959
implicated in real time problem solving

425
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:17,839
to establish

426
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,399
an ecologically realistic predictive

427
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,040
model

428
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,440
of possible improvisatory outcomes and

429
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,519
their effect on the audience

430
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,680
briefly in this part of the model we

431
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,959
identified various

432
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,880
multi-sensory variables such as the

433
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,079
visual and linguistic

434
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,800
information constantly in flux that

435
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,360
influence

436
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,839
how a musical improviser will react in

437
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,079
real time with any number of possible

438
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,040
musical sequences in this following part

439
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,279
of the model we have the identification

440
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:45,600
of

441
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,000
very specific elements of the visual and

442
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,920
linguistic information identified

443
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,160
as well as the combination of musical

444
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,320
building blocks utilized to represent

445
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,600
a closed set of emotional concepts

446
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,760
here we characterize the various goals

447
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
of the improvisatory process

448
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,399
and how various multi-sensory features

449
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:04,880
enter

450
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,639
into the problem-solving process and

451
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,120
actually influence the change of goals

452
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,800
across time and finally we identified

453
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,959
the interdependent novel ideas

454
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,519
focused concepts and enhanced emotion to

455
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,800
explain the resulting

456
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,040
live experience so why the arts

457
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,680
you may be asking this by now well

458
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,320
because

459
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,279
the arts are a fantastic cognitive

460
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,120
behavioral framework from which to

461
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,000
understand

462
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,560
the multi-layered complexity of human

463
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,440
behavior

464
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,600
given their multi-dimensionality and

465
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,360
interdependent roles

466
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,519
of individual expression technical

467
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,920
elements emotional motivations

468
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,279
and broader social political messaging

469
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,519
which is very much analogous to cyber

470
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,880
crime situations

471
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,959
be it from the attackers or defenders

472
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,399
perspective

473
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,240
as a parallel example just consider a

474
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,839
security analyst position

475
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,959
in situational awareness their role is

476
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,040
in holistically understanding an

477
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,240
enterprise's

478
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,000
information security environment to

479
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,079
efficiently and accurately predict and

480
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:08,880
respond

481
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,519
to potential threats by actively

482
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,199
monitoring their awareness of the

483
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,079
network

484
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,040
the threat itself and the mission during

485
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,079
real-time

486
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,360
crisis action response this role in and

487
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,000
of itself

488
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,480
needs to not just focus on simulations

489
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,639
of existing or past attacks to prevent

490
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,440
detect mitigate and recover but

491
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,399
crucially

492
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,959
to predict in a multi-directional way

493
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,639
something completely elusive

494
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,639
to artificial intelligence-based threat

495
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,839
detection algorithms

496
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,680
currently gaining popularity

497
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,639
my point is that ultimately the goal is

498
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,839
the creation

499
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,240
of a global mental model that consists

500
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,959
of identifying the micro mental models

501
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,680
like emotional influences knowledge

502
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,560
structures

503
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,199
ideation phases and external incoming

504
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,000
information

505
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,880
fundamental to improvisatory real-time

506
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,079
adaptive behavior

507
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,400
necessary for success within a changing

508
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,599
environment

509
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,199
because that is equivalent to

510
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,520
identifying the mental models of hackers

511
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,760
spontaneously adapting in real time to

512
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,439
the continuously changing cyber

513
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,720
landscape to stay

514
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,839
and steps ahead of their volatile

515
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,400
victims

516
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,720
which is equivalent to identifying the

517
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,959
mental models of defenders spontaneously

518
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,199
predicting and adapting in real time

519
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,439
to the incoming continuously changing

520
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,120
cyber attacks to steer away

521
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,160
and steps from the perpetrators

522
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,919
which brings me back to the greater

523
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,520
tripartite situation

524
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,280
of the need to answer three main

525
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,919
questions i brought up earlier

526
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,320
transparency or the nature of the

527
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,440
evidence

528
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,799
trust or our confidence in who is making

529
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,080
an attribution claim an intent

530
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,000
or the strength of the correlation

531
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,720
between behavior and mental states

532
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,880
and amid all the biases and ambiguities

533
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,960
of human perception and cognition

534
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,559
we need to build robust mental models of

535
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,679
both attackers

536
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,679
and offenders behavior because those

537
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,440
models will then improve

538
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,280
transparency trust and intent

539
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,320
because again cyber users defenders

540
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,000
and attackers are all human and when we

541
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,760
characterize the trending causes of

542
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,039
cyber crime

543
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,440
beliefs wants and desires are the

544
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,240
emotional

545
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,600
motivators underlying economic personal

546
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,960
political and or ideological gains from

547
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,360
cyber crime and the fact of the matter

548
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,720
is we humans are

549
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,280
efficient at dynamically understanding

550
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,960
the various features of these emotional

551
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,160
variables

552
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,799
years of evolution have endowed us with

553
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,120
the intelligent capacity to do so

554
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,760
in order to adapt but we must make the

555
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,039
variables explicit

556
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,960
and then integrate them within our

557
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,559
detection prediction

558
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,440
and reverse engineering models as many

559
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,000
analysts

560
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,880
know many attackers are consistent in

561
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,720
their behaviors and not only the victims

562
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,080
they choose

563
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,640
and how they inadvertently identify

564
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,280
themselves

565
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,919
digitally but in how they operate

566
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,679
throughout the attack cycle after

567
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,280
establishing a foothold

568
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,600
in the compromise network one obvious

569
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,200
example is the use of privilege

570
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,919
escalation tools

571
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,000
in conclusion my proposal is the

572
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,039
following

573
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,720
like the existential crisis that

574
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,080
healthcare industry

575
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,640
is dealing with where we can no longer

576
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,000
just treat disease

577
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,799
after the fact but need to prevent

578
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,120
disease with a holistic perspective

579
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,520
on mind body and the environment

580
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,160
cyber security needs a similar paradigm

581
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,799
shift

582
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,960
we need to spend far more serious

583
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,240
efforts in predicting

584
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,559
and preventing human creative behavior

585
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,160
before the attack

586
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,080
not just ad hoc by wading through what

587
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,679
we think is evidence

588
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,240
we need new methods and new methods that

589
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,960
include

590
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,120
human cognitive behavioral models that

591
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,880
are predictively useful

592
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,360
towards developing sophisticated

593
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,720
mathematical models

594
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,440
to then fine-tune algorithms for both

595
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,159
data

596
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,480
mining and artificial intelligence

597
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,320
training towards the detection

598
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,360
of advanced persistent threats but that

599
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,919
will only happen if we cross disciplines

600
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,640
and when we integrate what we know and

601
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
need to know about human perception

602
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,520
behavior and cognition to hack the minds

603
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:23,760
of

604
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,960
hackers just as hackers are hacking our

605
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,760
minds

606
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,080
because in the end it's all about

607
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,600
creative minds

608
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,840
at war with each other

609
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,080
i include here a list of sources

610
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,880
relevant to some of the points i made

611
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,280
and finally on that note thank you very

612
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,400
much for listening

613
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,919
and if you would like to contact me you

614
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,200
can reach me at monica

615
