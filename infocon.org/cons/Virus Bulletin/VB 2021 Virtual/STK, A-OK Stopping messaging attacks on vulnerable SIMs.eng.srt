2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,960
good afternoon or good morning our good

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,080
evening depending on what part of the

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,719
world you're in my name is kahul mcdade

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,760
i'm the cto of adaptive mobile security

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,600
and today i'm talking about presentation

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,000
entitled sdk aok mobile messaging

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,800
attacks on vulnerable sims

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,560
this presentation is something of a

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,800
follow-up presentation to a presentation

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,159
we give two years ago in vb 2019 in that

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,000
presentation we revealed the existence

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,840
of what we call the sim jacker

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,879
vulnerability this is an exploit of sim

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,399
cards within mobile phones which is

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,559
being used by surveillance companies to

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,960
track the location of tens of thousands

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,719
of mobile phone users

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,640
the vulnerability itself was present in

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,320
we believe several hundred million sim

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,320
cards so it's quite a large and serious

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,960
vulnerability which was discovered

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,559
for more information on that you can

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,399
clearly see it on our website at

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,719
simjacker.com but in our presentation

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,039
today we are trying to answer two

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,040
separate but related questions

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,360
one of those was that sim jacker was

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,000
actually using binary sms and in this

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,520
presentation we tried to see was there

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,360
any other similarly vulnerable

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,640
applications to binary sms and secondly

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,560
what we also try to answer

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,960
is the reaction of the industry and the

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,119
attackers to the actual revelation and

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,600
the the discovery of sim jacker

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,079
so before we go any further it's time

38
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,840
probably talk a little bit about what is

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,360
binary sms

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,520
well first of all binary sms is probably

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,439
used a lot more than you think if you

42
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,119
look at it into when we did some

43
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,119
analysis in three mobile operators we

44
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,720
could see that on the delivery side

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,920
which is from the messaging

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,399
infrastructure to the handset that quite

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,960
a large but fairly regular percentage of

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
traffic was actually of this type so

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,360
operator a to operator c is all roughly

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,799
between 39 and 35 percent of traffic

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,640
um a much smaller percentage of this

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,799
traffic then is used for these messages

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,560
which are sent to the actual sim card or

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,960
the uicc so this varies between

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,560
operators sometimes it's relatively high

56
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,560
around nine percent and sometimes it's

57
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,679
quite low

58
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,080
so the overall usage of binary sms is

59
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,400
for many things one of the most commonly

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,800
used is for missed call notifications

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,239
but also be used for changing roaming

62
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,920
settings and these messages which are

63
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,599
going to sim card these can change the

64
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,040
settings on the actual sim card

65
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,360
it's quite difficult in fact sometimes

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,200
to actually identify all the different

67
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,800
types of binary sms there's three

68
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,720
parameters which we use

69
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,040
within the actual message headers to

70
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,800
identify binary sms those are the pit

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,360
dcs and the user data header

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,040
by the way for for information on this

73
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,160
and for any other parts of my

74
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,319
presentation please please see the paper

75
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,239
which gets released at the same time of

76
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,360
vb 2021

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,200
so those are the

78
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,840
traditional good uses of binary sms but

79
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,239
it's very fair to say that binary sms

80
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,159
has also been misused over the last

81
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,159
really 20 years and some people be

82
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,319
surprised by how often it is misused and

83
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,840
how often new vulnerabilities actually

84
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,319
arise in the last 20 years been at least

85
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,519
28 known separate vulnerabilities

86
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,200
and they actually occur fairly regularly

87
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,560
over time

88
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,159
one interesting thing about this is when

89
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,920
we go to investigate this is that the

90
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,000
general complexities of these attacks or

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,200
these vulnerabilities have been

92
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,720
increasing over time

93
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,560
the initial vulnerabilities

94
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
as i show here were actually quite

95
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,879
simple mostly denial of service but the

96
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,400
more recent ones

97
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,239
have been used to extract information

98
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,239
such as the sim jacker attack are to do

99
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,000
other types of attacks

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,519
you can also see in some of these names

101
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,440
is that it's anytime there's publicity

102
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,120
about this as always sometimes scary

103
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,040
names such as the very first one which

104
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,040
we could be we can look at now with a

105
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,720
right smile but killer text message

106
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,560
found but also names like curse of

107
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,920
silence sms the debt monkey calendar and

108
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,319
so on the vast majorities of these like

109
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,159
i've said have targeted the device or

110
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,560
the os but recently as with the case of

111
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,000
sim jacker and also related attack

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,400
called web attack 25 percent of them one

113
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,159
quarter have targeted the sim card

114
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,560
itself

115
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,720
so

116
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,640
talking about those sim card destinate

117
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,120
sms we have to ask ourselves when

118
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,879
actually should we worry about these

119
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,880
the thing with sim jacker plus other

120
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,199
types of vulnerabilities like web attack

121
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,959
is what how they work is they use this

122
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,880
binary sms that was directed to a

123
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,479
specific vulnerable sim card application

124
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,080
and how they know what sim card

125
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,759
application to send it to is defined by

126
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,400
the tar value so the tar value is

127
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,560
something which is encoded in

128
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,160
a part and message called a command

129
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,320
header which is two or three layers

130
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,080
within the actual sms header of the

131
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,759
packet

132
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,280
so here you can see the tar header and

133
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,800
actually when it came to sap browser

134
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,639
which is what the sim jacker attack

135
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,080
exploited there was two separate

136
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,000
different tar values

137
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,840
however while this may identify the

138
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,639
actual vulnerable sim card application

139
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,240
this isn't really the parameter that we

140
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,320
worry about the parameter that we worry

141
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,919
about to see if this

142
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,280
actual sim card application is

143
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,800
vulnerable or not is the spi value

144
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,199
so and in particular what we look for is

145
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,479
the left most five bits of this value if

146
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,240
this is set to zero there's essentially

147
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,160
no security and what that means is that

148
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,320
any text message from any source which

149
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,880
is received by the sim card application

150
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,440
if the sim card application is expecting

151
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,520
these values to be set to zero then it

152
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,840
will accept this message from any source

153
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
and the ambiguous setting of this in the

154
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,680
sap browser specification was actually

155
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,759
the key cause of the sim jacker

156
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,320
vulnerability essentially the sim jacker

157
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,039
the

158
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,120
sap browser specification did not

159
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,440
specify exactly what to set this spi

160
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,120
value to as a result all the

161
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,639
implementations which went into all the

162
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,720
sim cards around the world

163
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,639
in the vast majority cases did not

164
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,320
expect any security to be set so they

165
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,720
accepted commands from any source

166
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,800
so what we did and a key part of this

167
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,960
research is we look to see where there

168
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,319
more of these vulnerable sim card

169
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,039
applications essentially we look to see

170
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,440
was there traffic that was being sent to

171
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,639
sim cards with this spa spi value are

172
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,199
the leftmost five bits of it set to zero

173
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,199
this was an indication that operators

174
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,600
were sending traffic of this type

175
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
to sim cards and they were expecting it

176
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,840
to be probably answered and it would

177
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,440
also indicate that this sim card

178
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,479
application

179
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,720
would then in theory accept these

180
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,840
commands from any source

181
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
so what did we find well if we took an

182
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
overall viewpoint of all the sim card

183
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,360
applications

184
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
the ones that we've talked about in the

185
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,199
past was that the vast majority of these

186
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,720
vulnerable sim card applications which

187
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,960
we could detect from messaging traffic

188
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,199
at least three quarters of them were sat

189
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,280
and 11 percent of them were from the web

190
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,000
browser but there was a small but you

191
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,560
know consistent percentage

192
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,840
of traffic

193
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,680
which originated from other sim card

194
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,120
applications

195
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,720
now this is made up of a lot of

196
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
different types of sim card applications

197
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,120
in fact there was over 30 unique tower

198
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,960
values now if you remember what i said

199
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,039
tower was towers that it actually stands

200
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,039
for toolkit application

201
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,680
reference this is the identifier of the

202
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,080
sim card application itself

203
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,479
but there's over 30 different ones

204
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,919
if you're wondering where this traffic

205
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,240
comes from this is traffic which we took

206
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,599
from uh from customer operators and how

207
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,160
we determined the total global view of

208
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,120
it is we took this traffic of traffic to

209
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,039
from global inbound rumors so we could

210
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,160
actually look as part of our

211
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,360
investigation to see what tar values we

212
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,520
were being sent messages from and using

213
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,440
these types of methods we can build up a

214
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,199
view of global

215
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,120
of globally vulnerable

216
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,000
sim card applications

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,280
so when we actually went and

218
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,440
investigated these in detail we could

219
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,199
see some interesting geographic uh

220
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,800
allocations of these

221
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,120
so the vast majority of these towers

222
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,639
were in places like um south america uh

223
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,280
parts of africa eastern europe russia

224
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,280
and a few parts of asia

225
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,280
we detected that these sim card

226
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,440
applications were active in roughly

227
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
about 50 operators and 39 different

228
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,479
countries

229
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,240
now the colors here themselves don't

230
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,919
actually represent the scale or the

231
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,479
usage of these tar values and the colors

232
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,160
actually represent the number of unique

233
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,720
guitars in those country so that's why

234
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,560
russia six is that we discovered that

235
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,400
there was six different unique guitar

236
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,280
values which had zero security set for

237
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,120
the actual prevalence and for the actual

238
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,520
usage of these sim card applications

239
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,199
there's more information on our paper

240
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,800
but in general we found that they

241
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,759
weren't

242
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,479
highly used unlike this that's why the

243
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,159
the percentage volumes were much less

244
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,320
than you could and for example the sap

245
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,839
browser or the web browser

246
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,839
however

247
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,920
it doesn't matter how large they're used

248
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,200
or how small they're used there's still

249
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,320
a question that we have to answer if

250
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,440
they're actually vulnerable because in

251
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,880
this particular case attackers could

252
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,480
actually exploit them

253
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,240
so then we had to do some analysis to

254
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,080
see you know were these sim card

255
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,760
applications actually vulnerable and

256
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,279
this is a really difficult question to

257
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,440
answer in our research we didn't have

258
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,519
time to reverse engineer the protocol

259
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,120
format of 30 different sim card

260
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,200
applications this would take several

261
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,839
months so instead

262
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,959
what we did as a sort of a quick but

263
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,120
reasonably effective method is we tried

264
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
to graph out the entropy of these of

265
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,640
these different applications

266
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,800
and the reasons we did this is the

267
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,399
theory behind this is that then you

268
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,880
could say that if a packet with which is

269
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,680
addressed to when these entire

270
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,080
applications has got low entropy and we

271
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,000
use sample and shine and entropy here in

272
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,240
these two axes then we could say that

273
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,920
its structure was you know not um random

274
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,240
but regular and so then an attacker if

275
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,480
they knew how to encode the message

276
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,040
could reasonably recreate it

277
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,800
and to prove why this method actually we

278
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,560
believe actually works here we can see

279
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,640
that the sat and the whip

280
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,399
tar values

281
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,080
taken as an average of their respective

282
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,000
towers you can see that they're over

283
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,760
towards the bottom left or certainly on

284
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,560
the left-hand side

285
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,640
but it's quite interesting if we look up

286
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,120
here in the top right here we can see

287
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,200
that these some of these tar values at

288
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
least the round one the round blue ones

289
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,839
they're all around got a high sample

290
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,399
entry and a high shannon entropy

291
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,920
and you could say well how do you know

292
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,279
and we believe in this particular case

293
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,680
that why do you have a high entry is

294
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,240
that they have encryption in place

295
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,760
and you could say well how do i know

296
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
that they have encryption placed well to

297
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,519
prove this we actually took some tower

298
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,839
values which we knew were had encryption

299
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,480
in place so these had an spi which is

300
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,640
that the leftmost five digits weren't

301
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,240
set to zero they're actually where some

302
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,920
of them were set to one

303
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
and but here we could actually see that

304
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,079
the entropy of these tar values which we

305
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,079
know had encryption placed also is in

306
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,800
the top right hand corner so this allows

307
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,399
us to confidently say that those tower

308
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,399
values up there even though they were

309
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,440
sent messages with the spi set to zero

310
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,279
they probably had some additional form

311
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,440
of encryption in place which meant then

312
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,640
that these applications aren't

313
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,480
vulnerable

314
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,279
the same can't be sent in said for these

315
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,040
applications the remaining applications

316
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,519
though because the entropy of those

317
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,279
seems to be considerably lower seems to

318
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,440
be around the scale of applications that

319
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,079
we know have been exploited such as sat

320
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,200
and web

321
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,560
we can probably say that there is

322
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,320
probably no encryption in place for

323
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,800
these sim card applications and if you

324
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,720
were to base the lack of encryption on

325
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,240
vulnerability that they are potentially

326
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,240
vulnerable

327
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,680
so

328
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,519
now that we're saying that these sim

329
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,880
card applications are potentially

330
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,640
vulnerable then we have a question about

331
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,320
what could be achieved if you could

332
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,800
actually access them and instruct them

333
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,880
to do malicious operations

334
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,120
well from our investigation

335
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,480
as i explained we didn't reverse

336
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,079
engineer authority applications but what

337
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,320
we could do is we could tell from the

338
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,240
types of messages which had been sent

339
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,839
and sometimes the responses of what was

340
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,920
occurring what actually

341
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,519
they were being used for so from our

342
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,880
investigation the majority's

343
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,959
applications were used simply for

344
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,040
notifications in some cases for contacts

345
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,320
to change

346
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,440
generally the

347
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,200
scale of malicious activity you could do

348
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,880
these was you would expect to be

349
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,720
relatively limited although they could

350
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,160
be exploited you know there could be

351
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,399
possibilities of putting malicious

352
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,399
contacts onto a person's phone or to

353
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,240
give them some notifications which they

354
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,760
may not be expected or telling them to

355
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,839
do something which you know may not be

356
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,440
desirable

357
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,720
however there were some tires

358
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,200
uicc applications which have access to a

359
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,360
lot more sensitive information those are

360
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,560
primarily the tires we start with 0xb

361
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,720
and in some of those cases those could

362
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,959
be if they were used and if an attacker

363
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,639
was aware that they were made available

364
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,399
you could use them for location tracking

365
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,639
because you would request the

366
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,959
specific location from the sim card you

367
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,399
could potentially extract information

368
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,160
from the same directory such as mz

369
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,839
certain cases you potentially could

370
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,760
extract the sim key and you could change

371
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,600
things like the roaming settings

372
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,360
in those particular cases

373
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,000
those tires those zero xp ones should

374
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,320
always have their security set so in

375
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,839
those particular cases it seems that

376
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,920
possibly when we discussed with the

377
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,360
operator there may have been some

378
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,399
changes or there may be some

379
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,320
configuration irregularities which may

380
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,519
have temporarily allowed some access

381
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,279
so when we add up all of these

382
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,600
potentially um

383
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,040
and when we when we try to make an

384
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,720
estimation of how many subscribers were

385
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,480
potentially vulnerable which is a useful

386
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,240
metric to see this the total scale of

387
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,839
the threat level

388
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,200
there's several different metrics that

389
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,560
we could take

390
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,959
a very unrealistic but theoretical

391
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,920
maximum number of vulnerable sim cards

392
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,720
will be around 700 million 770 million

393
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,160
we don't think it's anything that high

394
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,680
because in the vast majority of these

395
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,920
cases we believe that so many sim cards

396
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,440
applications were only present on a

397
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,399
subset of operators traffic

398
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,240
uh a much more conservative estimate is

399
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,079
probably only between 30 to 40 million

400
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,360
sim cards

401
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
are potentially vulnerable and it's

402
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,040
probably very probably that much less

403
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,120
than 100 million uh sim cards are

404
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,800
actually vulnerable and like i said the

405
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,120
scale of vulnerability varies here i'm

406
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,880
saying any type of vulnerability so this

407
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,560
includes these

408
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,800
applications which potentially have just

409
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,000
which you could just potentially do

410
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,680
malicious notifications or contacts

411
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,880
exchange rates

412
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,720
so any type of vulnerability is not good

413
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,320
but in general

414
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,000
the scalities would not be the same

415
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,480
level as the satch browser or the web

416
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,120
attack but like i said some of them had

417
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,839
access to quite sensitive information

418
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,680
and but the good thing about this though

419
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,199
is that from our investigation over the

420
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,120
last six months to a year we don't see

421
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,639
any of these applications being

422
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,079
exploited this is very very different

423
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,680
from the sap browser which we saw being

424
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,440
exploited by surveillance company so

425
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,680
this is very very good news

426
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,360
and at the same time as well we've also

427
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,959
reached out and

428
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,120
informed all the operators which we

429
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,120
could identify about this and in our

430
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,480
paper as well we also cover the

431
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,040
different responses and our interactions

432
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,480
with the operator to get them to make

433
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,240
changes and to

434
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,920
fix the sim card settings or put in

435
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,480
security if they weren't able to

436
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,079
directly influence the sim cards

437
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,959
so this is a relatively good case we

438
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,680
were able to identify extensively

439
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,040
these sim card applications and like i

440
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,800
said it's also a relatively good case in

441
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,240
that we didn't see any sign of

442
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,000
exploitation

443
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,800
but it's a good time now two years on

444
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,639
for us to possibly look back and take

445
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,920
stock on

446
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,160
some of the activity we we reported on

447
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,639
two years ago because we can also see

448
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,000
some of the differences that happened

449
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,120
since then

450
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,040
and now and also the reason some of the

451
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,480
decisions that we actually made at the

452
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,000
time because it actually makes sense for

453
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,959
a good

454
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,279
after action review

455
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,160
so

456
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
when we communicated the sim jacker

457
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,639
vulnerability in 2019 we had several

458
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,639
issues in doing this first of all that

459
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,560
this was a very very obscure technology

460
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,880
the sap browser technology very obscure

461
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,279
but it actually had a wide access it had

462
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,120
complete access to a subset of the sdk

463
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,279
toolkit on the mobile on the mobile sim

464
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,160
card

465
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,000
there was also issues as well that only

466
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,680
mobile operators could mitigate the

467
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,880
vulnerability

468
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,240
so

469
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,839
there was very little that uri could

470
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,040
actually do about this other than

471
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
possibly changing operator which in some

472
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,880
cases was pointless because every

473
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,240
operator in certain countries actually

474
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,120
use a technology are the very worst or

475
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,720
the very best you know

476
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,399
the only one possibility you could have

477
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,680
is maybe just stop using your mobile

478
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,800
phone which wouldn't be realistic in

479
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,959
many cases

480
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,199
we also had a obviously a massive

481
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,639
massive issue that it wasn't just a

482
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,240
theoretical vulnerability it was also

483
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,000
been actively exploited by a

484
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,759
sophisticated surveillance company to

485
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,600
attract tens of thousands of people so

486
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,800
this wasn't the

487
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,399
attack in theory this was being used

488
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,800
every single day

489
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,040
and there was also the scale so unlike

490
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,639
the previous sim card applications which

491
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,680
we have talked about which would be

492
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,360
monitoring for several months

493
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,800
the sap browser was considerably

494
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
different it was much much more wide

495
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,759
scale

496
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,399
um we saw at least 61 mobile operators

497
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,959
and it was heavily used in several in in

498
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,040
several of those 29 countries in fact

499
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,440
heavily used in most of those countries

500
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,399
and

501
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,079
the other issue that we had at the time

502
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,759
is potentially on no more operators

503
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,720
because

504
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
the sap browser functionality had been

505
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,639
employed in many operators and in some

506
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,079
cases they had stopped using it but

507
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,760
there was many residual sim cards in

508
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,439
those operators where it was still

509
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,760
present and because our observations

510
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,439
were primarily from what we saw in

511
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,599
active users being sent these messages

512
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,640
we didn't have a full idea of how many

513
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,319
operators still had it resident under

514
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,760
sim cards but just dormant

515
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,000
so how we went about informing the

516
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,319
industry is that we did it through the

517
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,960
working group for the gsm

518
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,320
community which is called the gsm

519
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,919
association through their coordinate

520
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,360
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

521
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,960
program

522
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,160
this has

523
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,320
is very effective but it has certain

524
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,080
gaps in that

525
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,840
the there are several hundred mobile

526
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,000
operators in the world and many of them

527
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,080
while they're all members of the gsm

528
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,400
association many of them actively don't

529
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,400
actively participate and so even though

530
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,240
some information may be shared they

531
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,840
don't actually see it

532
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,960
as well as that there's also

533
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,280
effectiveness of it um

534
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,640
it's quite a new program it's just

535
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,600
getting started out and in fact the sim

536
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,120
jacket vulnerability was the first one

537
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,840
of a live vulnerability ever

538
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,360
recorded and disclosed within the gsm

539
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,280
association and also there was a

540
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,640
question that we had of of leakage um

541
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,000
we were worried as well that some of

542
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,919
this information would also make its way

543
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,600
to attacker which may make our job and

544
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
actually blocking it

545
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,200
slightly more harder

546
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,320
so we had a a conundrum in how to make

547
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,799
sure that all the vulnerabilities were

548
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,960
made all vulnerable operators were made

549
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,960
aware of these of this vulnerability

550
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
so one particular approach that we took

551
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,919
and i know it's not everybody's um

552
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,919
favorite way of doing it is we consider

553
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,840
idea of a branded vulnerability and if

554
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,679
people remember the symbol some people

555
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,960
think it is a really you know

556
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,160
interesting

557
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
uh marketing event or people see it as

558
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,840
pure marketing other people saw it as a

559
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,760
good cyber security method of course the

560
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,400
heartbeat vulnerability in 2014

561
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,000
quickly followed up up many many other

562
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,600
vulnerabilities and factors whole web

563
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,440
pages that cover all the different logos

564
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
about this

565
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,520
branded vulnerabilities

566
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,240
obviously if overused to cause problems

567
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,919
and i know certainly that many cyber

568
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,600
security professionals would see them as

569
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,919
not the best way for former industry

570
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,720
but

571
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,320
you also have to consider that in

572
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,559
certain circumstances you know they do

573
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,360
gain publicity and they do also

574
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,880
the most important part of it get the

575
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,480
attention of those who maybe need to

576
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,400
make changes and need to put in security

577
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,760
in place

578
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,840
so the approach that we took given the

579
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,960
fairly

580
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,640
unique set of circumstances in our

581
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,240
mobile industry was a sort of a

582
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,320
three-stage approach

583
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,400
one is that for several months we

584
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,240
informed the community as best as

585
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,600
possible

586
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,679
both through the gsm association cvd

587
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,840
program and also direct contacts as well

588
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,120
reaching out to the operators that we

589
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,799
could see were being effective telling

590
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,600
them

591
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
that this technology is present on your

592
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,760
sim cards it's been actively exploited

593
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,840
and you need to mitigate this and a lot

594
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,200
of technical information was given

595
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,720
behind the scenes to these operators

596
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,960
however that we did then succession on

597
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,600
september 12 2019

598
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,400
to do initial public notification

599
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,880
with publicity and the brand to notify

600
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,280
any unaware mobile operators

601
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,440
those two parts to this is that

602
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,520
we gave the concepts but we were careful

603
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,679
not to give the full technical

604
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,679
information and the reason we didn't

605
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,679
give the full technical information

606
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,799
is that

607
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,960
if a person understood exactly what was

608
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,000
happening

609
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,600
it's actually relatively easy for them

610
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,280
to recreate this if they have the skills

611
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,880
in the gsm area

612
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,320
so we do not want to have a situation

613
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,520
where given away full technical

614
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,200
information without being certain that

615
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,520
every operator had a chance to actually

616
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,679
mitigate and put in defenses

617
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,520
before that actually happened and what

618
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,840
we did do as well in that public

619
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,520
notification is that we pointed mobile

620
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,400
operators to gsma where there was

621
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,679
full technical information available

622
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,280
and then of course then we present the

623
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,360
information of virus bulletin 2019 and

624
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,760
that was four weeks later

625
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,080
now it's fair to say that

626
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,240
in the initial response to this

627
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,520
certainly there was some industry

628
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,840
observers who said that either a that

629
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,360
this they didn't believe that this was

630
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,039
actually possible or b that this

631
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,480
vulnerability we're talking about simply

632
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,440
a copy and paste of different

633
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,280
vulnerabilities and there was

634
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,120
um including some interesting news

635
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,200
articles with these different doubts

636
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,280
about the sim jacker flaw

637
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,880
and this is what i mentioned about this

638
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,480
is why i've covered other problems in

639
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,919
interim this

640
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,600
was something that could have happened

641
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,120
and we feared it could happen and it did

642
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,200
actually happen so we didn't have to ask

643
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,120
ourselves was the method that we took

644
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,280
the right approach was this method of

645
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,120
giving some partial information with a

646
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,200
brand and then pointing operators

647
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,120
to the community and then given the full

648
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,799
information four weeks later was this

649
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,240
actually correct

650
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,720
not least because you know for from our

651
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,039
own perspective seeing people and i

652
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,520
understand why question the information

653
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,000
release was was interesting to say the

654
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,840
least but let's look at the stats and

655
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,679
let's look at the figures

656
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:56,799
so here

657
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,720
we can actually see this graph here

658
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,400
represents the number of mobile

659
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,240
operators that we could see using the

660
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,559
sap browser technology per day with

661
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,159
security levels set to zero this is

662
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,480
basically the number of unique operators

663
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,919
per day which we could see were

664
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,559
vulnerable

665
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,480
one interesting here so here is on the

666
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,000
12th of september where we release our

667
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,240
public information and then under this

668
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,480
other green dot the third of october is

669
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,400
when we give the technical information

670
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,000
so you can basically say that everything

671
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,159
fertile several months beforehand in

672
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,600
this period of time we were telling

673
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,159
mobile operators that the sap browser is

674
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,240
vulnerable you need to make changes

675
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,159
either put protection in your network or

676
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,600
either look to see how you can

677
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,320
reconfigure your sim cards

678
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,159
so even though there were several months

679
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,840
of information that we were given to

680
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,840
mobile operators up to the point where

681
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,840
we released the public information

682
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,520
the really interesting part from our

683
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,280
perspective

684
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,120
is that for the next couple of weeks

685
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,600
there were several spikes

686
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,960
and these spikes when we went

687
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,480
investigate and looked it was a whole

688
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,080
bunch of mobile operators that we hadn't

689
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,159
seen been active before and what we

690
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,360
believe that they were doing is that

691
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,960
they started doing testing and then

692
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,120
doing the level of basically

693
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,760
reconfiguration of their sim cards

694
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,760
and the fact is that this only happened

695
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
after our public release of information

696
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,960
we would have expected this would have

697
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,000
happened beforehand because we're

698
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,520
sharing information

699
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,320
so

700
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,080
what actually happened was we've been

701
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,240
sharing information but some a whole

702
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,400
bunch of sub of operators hadn't

703
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,559
actually received it

704
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,400
or possibly not acted but that's quite

705
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,600
unlikely

706
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,360
in that time period and he only took

707
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
action of when the sim jacker

708
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,720
vulnerability was announced with the

709
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,640
brands and so on so at least from this

710
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,120
perspective and the fact is that we

711
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,480
could see these spikes before the

712
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,840
technical release

713
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,360
it showed that this system actually

714
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,559
worked the method we took actually

715
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,720
worked there's no guarantee that if we

716
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,080
just um

717
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,600
giving out the information initially

718
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,960
that these operators wouldn't been

719
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,320
attacked in those couple of weeks

720
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,720
previously

721
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,559
so this is quite interesting for our

722
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,000
perspective another observation here you

723
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,679
can see the the number of operators

724
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,200
vulnerable after this point stays

725
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,279
relatively static and the reason why

726
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,120
that is is that the vast majority of

727
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,400
mobile operators have actually built in

728
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,840
defenses into their mobile network

729
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,200
they've persisted in using the sap

730
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,360
browser which is a perfect legitimate

731
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,440
way of dealing with the vulnerability

732
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,679
but it's these spikes here were actually

733
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,840
a bunch of operators who only

734
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,679
occasionally use it so they could make

735
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,600
the effort to then detect this and then

736
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,440
essentially disable it under sim cards

737
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,520
the vast majority of operators elsewhere

738
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,440
around the world use it too much so they

739
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,640
put in defenses in on the network site

740
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,000
so this is interesting to see the

741
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,440
reaction from the mobile operator

742
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,880
community

743
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,840
who tend to react towards the end or

744
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,000
after public release but it's actually

745
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,760
quite diff different when we actually

746
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,760
look at the company that are doing the

747
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,520
attacks as actual surveillance companies

748
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,159
and we can also see changes in their

749
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,720
reaction as well

750
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,760
so

751
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,640
these whole set of colors is actually

752
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,159
each color represents a unique

753
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,240
subscriber so here what we have is at

754
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,000
the top and the bottom band these are

755
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,919
two mobile operators where we saw some

756
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,640
sim jacker activity happening so you can

757
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,240
see on the left hand side for both many

758
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,320
many different colors and each column is

759
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,559
per day and this is typical of how a

760
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,919
surveillance company works the vast

761
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,760
majority of time they are tracking lots

762
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,240
of different mobile subscribers and this

763
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,760
is what you could say and from our

764
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,200
investigation this is a standard

765
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,039
behavior from them

766
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,480
however you can observe it on the right

767
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,159
is very very different the richness of

768
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,400
colors is completely gone you only see

769
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,559
one or two different colors

770
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,720
and the key and

771
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,159
then we have to ask ourselves what

772
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,440
actually happened during this whole

773
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,520
period of time our

774
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,279
our work with mobile operators was

775
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,640
essentially the same we weren't making

776
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,720
any changes so this is all due to the

777
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,480
surveillance company's decisions and we

778
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,840
can see some key changes

779
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,760
when we look here this is actually the

780
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,520
date when we released our public

781
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,360
information

782
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,559
however

783
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,760
you can see

784
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,640
that

785
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,400
the actual change happened several days

786
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,799
beforehand so if the sim jacker

787
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,799
attackers had made a decision to change

788
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,080
their activity based on our public

789
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,440
release

790
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,559
everything should have changed on the

791
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,640
12th but it didn't it changed several

792
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,480
days beforehand

793
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,159
so as i mentioned earlier one thing that

794
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,159
we were interested in understanding was

795
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,799
to see what level of essentially leakage

796
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,720
of this information would have there

797
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,240
been to these attackers

798
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,320
we must be realistic there's roughly

799
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,840
about 800

800
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,679
mobile operators in the world today and

801
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,360
there's many other people who work with

802
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,600
them in conjunction with them so we

803
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,520
expected it sooner or later because we'd

804
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,799
share this information within the mobile

805
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:29,919
community that this information would

806
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,840
leak out to these companies

807
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,840
and we were quite impressed that it was

808
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,679
until up until quite near the very end

809
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,039
when this information seems to have

810
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,880
percolated true to them and they started

811
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,960
making changes so what they did was they

812
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
started moving to a pure testing

813
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,240
environment

814
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,279
and

815
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,200
so as in order to change the scale and

816
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,240
the type to their attacks

817
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,600
so you can see there's two different um

818
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,760
perspectives there mobile operators and

819
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,520
certain circumstances wait till after

820
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,120
public information and in these

821
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,200
attackers you know in their changes we

822
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,880
could see a change before the public

823
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,520
information was released

824
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,799
so we've also observed other changes

825
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,200
well from these sim jacker attackers and

826
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,799
one of the key methods that they've

827
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,720
tried to do is evasion so what they are

828
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
trying to evade is any type of defenses

829
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,640
that we put in with our customer mobile

830
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,559
operators to block their sim jacker

831
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,159
attacks

832
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,760
so if you recall from the presentations

833
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,520
i gave two years ago there's multiple

834
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,120
different ways of ejecting in the sim

835
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,880
checker attacks you can do it via your

836
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,559
mobile handset you could do it via

837
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,880
connection via smpp or you can do a file

838
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,600
connection via ss7

839
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,080
and of course once we and our customers

840
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,480
put in blocks or firewalls to stop these

841
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,240
messages then these attacks often cease

842
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,120
but

843
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,279
as i covered previously these are

844
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,880
professional surveillance companies it

845
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,559
is their job and is what being paid a

846
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,039
lot of money to do to track people on

847
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,279
behalf of their customers

848
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,360
and they don't just think in behi in

849
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,080
terms of specifications or standards

850
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,000
they just think on behalf of their they

851
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,320
think in the scale of their targets they

852
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,000
need to track these targets regardless

853
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,520
of their technologies

854
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,679
so what we constantly have to keep an

855
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,840
eye out for and look for is if they find

856
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,279
new ways of injecting in their attacks

857
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,919
and as you can imagine we've seen some

858
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,480
uh interesting ways of that they've done

859
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,320
this and some of these are very very

860
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,240
interesting indeed so one of the most

861
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
interesting is the fact that we observed

862
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,840
these sim jack attack use a different

863
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,159
protocol so you actually use is they

864
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,279
injected sms over sip message

865
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,120
so sip is used for many things used for

866
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,760
voice or voip call and voice setup but

867
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,320
it's also used in so many ims protocols

868
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,559
and volte networks and in this

869
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,919
particular case one of our customer

870
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,480
operators the attackers discovered

871
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,000
that there was a means in which they

872
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,760
could inject their attacks using sip

873
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,960
over using a sip message

874
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,080
so

875
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,919
i wish i could say this is the only one

876
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,919
of these type stacks i mean the but

877
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,520
we've seen multiple different types of

878
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,039
variations multiple different types of

879
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,159
attempts to inject different types

880
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,799
stacks and sometimes the the

881
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,320
different types of methods is really

882
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,080
really inventive

883
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,000
but this is one particularly interesting

884
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,480
one that we observed and when we do

885
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,960
observe these different types of evasion

886
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,240
met techniques there is always an

887
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,159
inevitable period of time between when

888
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,320
we detect them to when we go to

889
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,000
essentially block and protect the

890
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,279
subscribers

891
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,039
and those small periods of time when we

892
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,399
can actually observe

893
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,799
the attacks happening

894
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,480
in their as you could say native

895
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,159
environment as opposed to a period where

896
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,919
the the attackers are actually trying to

897
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,520
test against us where those attacks

898
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,399
aren't

899
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,600
um

900
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,360
real of a you could say a normal

901
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,880
environment this allows us to make

902
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,480
judgments on the scale of the attacks

903
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,360
so

904
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,120
and that's what this is done

905
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,799
so when we actually look to those

906
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,559
periods of time those brief periods of

907
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,720
time when the attacks when we identify

908
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,880
those gaps in them we can see a large

909
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,480
variety of different types of devices

910
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,480
which are attempt to be tracked so the

911
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,240
largest type would was obviously a

912
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,679
smartphone

913
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,360
and actually actually the large type of

914
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,840
phone which is being tracked is would be

915
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,760
apple phones of iphones

916
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,440
now before you try to say anything like

917
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,440
oh is apple more vulnerable or google or

918
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,600
is android better it's not actually that

919
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,760
is that the people using these attacks

920
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,159
these sim jack attacks are targeting a

921
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,840
broad spectrum of essentially the

922
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,760
mexican market and so these are more

923
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,200
representative of the

924
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,039
deployment or the types of devices in

925
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,240
mexico as opposed to device

926
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,520
vulnerability

927
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,760
any mobile device which has a sim card

928
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,840
in it with a sap browser is potentially

929
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,000
vulnerable in these cases in fact we

930
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,600
uncovered some quite interesting devices

931
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,520
being tracked including black phone from

932
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
solid circle and as well as that we also

933
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,679
noticed and detected some

934
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,440
iot type devices being tracked as well

935
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,880
so it's a whole range of different types

936
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,880
devices but it really comes down to the

937
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,520
sim card as opposed to the actual device

938
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,279
type

939
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,880
as well as that these brief periods of

940
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,120
time also allows us to make estimates

941
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,919
estimates of the scale of devices and

942
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,519
essentially the scale of number of

943
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,919
people who would normally be tracked so

944
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,600
assuming a world where

945
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,080
there was no protection in place

946
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,559
say this would be pre-2019

947
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,880
we would have estimated that it was

948
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,480
roughly around 250 260 thousand hundred

949
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,440
thousand

950
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,880
location lookups per year and

951
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,320
given the fact that some people are

952
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,399
targeted multiple times we estimated

953
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,480
around 31 000 people

954
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,919
unique subscribers per year being

955
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,159
targeted by the system

956
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,919
those are huge numbers

957
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,240
and this is not just a system which has

958
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,399
been used or was being used for

959
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,559
you know you could say targeted you know

960
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,799
tracking this has been used to track

961
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,519
tens of thousands of people in mexico

962
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,760
per year

963
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,880
given the scale of this type of attacks

964
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,399
again i have to say that these attackers

965
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,919
are not going away and from our

966
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,840
perspective this is a constant exercise

967
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,279
to detect and block these we believe

968
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,399
that they have been

969
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,760
um

970
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,360
quite consistent they're certainly being

971
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,039
quite determined over the last two years

972
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,320
to try to make sure that their attacks

973
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,000
get together so from our perspective

974
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,320
it's constant exercise to try to detect

975
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
uh detect any potential holes or

976
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,080
vulnerabilities may be present and then

977
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,639
block these

978
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,880
so i hope you found this presentation

979
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,360
quick but uh useful

980
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
um there's three main conclusions and

981
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
takeaways i can take you from this

982
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,080
binary sms has been around for over 20

983
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,919
years people forget that and people

984
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,440
every time it comes up

985
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,039
people sometimes might assume that well

986
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,039
this is old technology but it's going to

987
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,120
continue to happen binary sms sms is

988
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,039
still going to be used in 5g so this

989
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,559
technology is not going away anytime

990
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,799
soon but there is work ongoing within

991
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,159
the industry since

992
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,600
the sim jacker vulnerability was

993
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,960
released there has been work behind the

994
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,200
scenes within the gsm association to

995
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,880
help define

996
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,159
and uh

997
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,080
techniques and methods to to block not

998
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,519
only that but all different types of

999
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,320
binary sms so there is work ongoing and

1000
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,000
has happened in the background on this

1001
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,600
area

1002
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,760
um as part of this work we we undertook

1003
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,440
and we did identify these

1004
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,640
um

1005
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,480
30 potentially vulnerable sim card

1006
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,679
applications

1007
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,320
and like i said thankfully many of them

1008
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,760
most of them don't see to be the same

1009
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,120
certainly not the same scale and don't

1010
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,960
seem to be exploited but their potential

1011
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,640
vulnerability is present so mobile

1012
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,399
operators need to be aware of this and

1013
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,919
then need to focus on putting in

1014
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,080
security for these sim card applications

1015
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,919
and finally as we show in certain

1016
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,000
circumstances surveillance companies do

1017
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,600
react faster than mobile operators or a

1018
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,760
subset of mobile operators

1019
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,120
and what i was saying is what we say

1020
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,200
with our customer operators is that you

1021
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,600
know slow as fast and old as new

1022
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
it's better to do this right

1023
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,200
and get this right

1024
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
and because the actual attackers

1025
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,720
themselves they don't think in the terms

1026
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,799
of one protocol or different protocol or

1027
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,200
ip versus mobile network they think of

1028
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,720
terms of targets and they will use

1029
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,960
whatever technology and whatever methods

1030
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,640
they can to get information on their

1031
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,159
targets

1032
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,320
and so to stop that happening threat

1033
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,080
intelligence is key knowing what types

1034
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,159
of attacks knowing the capabilities of

1035
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,840
the mobile network knowing what they've

1036
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,440
tried to do in the past and

1037
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,720
understanding what they may try to do in

1038
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,360
the future is key then

1039
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,520
these are very these are not

1040
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,719
ordinary criminals these are well-funded

1041
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,119
technically very

1042
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,960
clever technically very proficient

1043
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,280
individuals doing these types of attacks

1044
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,639
most of them i would say possibly also

1045
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,960
from a mobile background originally

1046
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,280
so in that in the best case just try to

1047
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,280
stop those trend intelligence you know

1048
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,119
intelligence what's actually going on

1049
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,440
experience and security mindset is key

1050
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,079
to defeating these

1051
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,918
so thank you very much for attending my

1052
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,239
presentation today i hope you found it

1053
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,159
useful it was very quick

1054
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,079
and like i said the paper is available

1055
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,280
on the vb 2021 website i hope you find

1056
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
that useful is obviously much larger

1057
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,040
than this and i'd like to thank all

1058
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,440
members of my team and i wish you a very

1059
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,079
good day goodbye

1060
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,929
