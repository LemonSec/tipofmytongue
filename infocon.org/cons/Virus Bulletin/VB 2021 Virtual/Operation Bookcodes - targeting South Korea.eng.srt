00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,599
hello everyone my name is don kim from

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,599
the korea internet security agency

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,000
first of all thanks for allowing me to

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,400
present myself in front of you

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,760
these four sections

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,360
of the agenda will be our presentation

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,920
subject

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,920
let me begin with initial infiltration

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,520
the operation blue course attack started

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,320
in

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,760
april 2019

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,960
the operation targeted specific

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,239
companies in korea that resulted to

15
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,840
numerous cnc firms

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,080
our investigation

17
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,360
began using documents that include

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,600
remotely controlled mario

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,479
which were acquired in january and

20
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,400
february of 2020

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,360
the common ground was documents

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,520
was saved under the names of public ins

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,960
institution

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,759
related to the domestic maritime

25
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,400
industry

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,360
the contents suggested that

27
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,960
the attackers

28
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,680
pretended to be employees of the public

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,479
institution and attempted to attack

30
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,600
marine related companies

31
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,920
as i have shown you in the previous

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,159
slide

33
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,920
we investigated the incident regarding

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,160
the cnc servers and victim system for

35
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,359
about 5 months

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,640
the figure on this slide

37
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,840
shows how the attacker configured the

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,760
attack network

39
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,720
which were found during our

40
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,599
investigation

41
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,319
the article

42
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,560
created on mid server to manage infected

43
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,920
system

44
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,720
and

45
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,239
configured multiple cnc servers for

46
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,440
remote control and command transmission

47
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,840
they attacked specific groups

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,760
including the media

49
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,480
and security software development

50
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,239
companies

51
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,760
in addition to

52
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,200
companies related to the maritime

53
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,839
industry

54
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,519
it was also found the articles

55
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,040
exploited with web servers using their

56
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,760
cnc servers among the infected system

57
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,799
we found two more well this distribution

58
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,640
scenario in

59
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,080
operation book codes

60
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,360
case a shows mario distribution by

61
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,040
attaching

62
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,679
documents

63
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,040
when the victim opens or hwp documents

64
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,360
for the first time

65
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,159
remotely controlled marvel is installed

66
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,920
in the victim's computer

67
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,920
afterwards

68
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,360
the memorial downloads or dropper

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,480
another malware by communicating with

70
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,760
the mario distribution server

71
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,760
and executed to infect the second model

72
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,040
in this case the second remotely

73
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,918
controlled model executed by the dropper

74
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,199
was the same

75
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,280
as the first one

76
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,240
used for users used for initial

77
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,240
infiltration

78
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,360
however

79
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,759
the difference from the

80
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,040
mario used for initial infiltrations was

81
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,600
that the second model was

82
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,639
secured with continuity

83
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,880
the second model registered

84
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,520
launcher in the registry

85
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,400
so

86
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,680
it is executed every time the infected

87
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,479
system is booted

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,800
after going through this process

89
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,880
the articles collect

90
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,160
collect

91
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,280
information and spread malware

92
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,719
throughout the target organization

93
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,919
case b shows

94
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,680
moral dispute

95
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,400
distribution using our link

96
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,520
in phishing emails

97
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,880
when the recipient clicks the link

98
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,759
it redirects to a malicious website

99
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,840
then the website checks whether the xsip

100
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,840
is target system's ip

101
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,800
address

102
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,919
if the ip address is found to be

103
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,360
originated from the target

104
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,840
the system downloads and executes the

105
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,800
model this slide shows the distribution

106
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,120
process of case a in detail

107
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,520
when the big victim opens the mario

108
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,960
infected documents for the first time

109
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,400
it will

110
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,080
execute a share code is insulted in the

111
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,719
document

112
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,080
then

113
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,120
the sharecode injects a backdoor

114
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,400
into the

115
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,960
document memory and execute it

116
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,160
at this time

117
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,639
the backdoor sends the information of

118
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,759
the infected system

119
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,639
by communicating with the cnc servers

120
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,440
when the information sent to the

121
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,280
attackers then they determines the level

122
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,880
of importance of the infected system

123
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,120
until they download and

124
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,000
execute the drawfall in

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,120
infected system

126
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,720
three files are created when the dropper

127
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,520
is

128
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,159
executed

129
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,759
inf file contains the list of exchange

130
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,759
server addresses

131
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,880
while dla file is the encrypted mario

132
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
launcher

133
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,160
d85 is on encrypted remotely controlled

134
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,639
malware

135
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,520
the dropper registers the launchers in

136
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,560
the registry to automatically execute

137
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,520
the launcher when the infected system is

138
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,919
booted

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,599
then the launcher decrypts the encrypted

140
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,919
remotely controlled mario

141
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,360
injects

142
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,960
it into the process and execute it

143
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,479
the executed model reads

144
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,960
the cnc server addresses

145
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,879
saved in the inf file and starts

146
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,199
communication with the servers

147
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,400
the articles made it easy to replace

148
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,919
those server addresses by changing inf

149
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,240
file only

150
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,919
here you can see the distribution

151
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,080
process of case b in detail

152
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,160
phishing emails induce victims to click

153
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,240
the link via internet explorer

154
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,159
by looking at the articles requesting to

155
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,958
use a specific browser

156
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,360
it is assumed that

157
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,919
the funeral vulnerability of the

158
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,880
specific browser was exploited to

159
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,399
download the mario

160
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,440
when the victim clicks the link

161
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
it redirects the

162
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
tool of

163
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,640
infected website

164
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,760
the web page checks whether the access

165
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,279
ip matches

166
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,000
its target ip addresses

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,839
through md5 conversion

168
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,399
if the victim's ip address matches the

169
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,600
target ip address

170
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,279
the victim is redirected to another

171
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,800
website that downloads another marvel to

172
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,640
conduct malicious behavior

173
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,320
the next topic will be shared by the

174
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,360
next presenter theory

175

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,040
the material used by operation blue

180
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,439
cores

181
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,360
malware can be largely classified into

182
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,800
drawfor

183
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,439
download and pre-code red

184
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,800
this slide explains a type of malware

185
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,600
called dropper

186
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,360
the dropper behaviors according to two

187
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,079
option values

188
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,640
the g option

189
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,079
collects the list of services

190
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,079
in the net swc group inside as which

191
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,560
hosts and retrieves

192
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,920
the service

193
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,040
names that are not currently

194
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,800
used in the system

195
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,519
the s option registers the launcher file

196
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,120
in the registry for automatic execution

197
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,640
and execute remotely controlled malware

198
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,800
the registry name tlr file filename and

199
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,519
rc for key value

200
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,760
used for decryption are used as command

201
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,880
line argument

202
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,160
here

203
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,200
one of the service name that

204
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,519
are not in use

205
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,040
which was identified by using the g

206
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
option

207
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,640
is selected are registered as the

208
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,839
registry name

209
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,600
next

210
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,839
is the downloader

211
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,720
the downloader uses an encrypted

212
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,399
download address

213
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,760
and pass

214
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,079
to download or file

215
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,439
as argument values

216
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,880
when the second argument

217
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,880
on encrypted string is decrypted

218
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,120
called downloader can check

219
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,839
the primary and secondary download

220
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,440
address

221
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,920
that will be accessed by

222
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,800
the malware

223
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,360
the attackers use an algorithm

224
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,200
that customize the des algorithm

225
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,079
you can see here

226
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,839
how the download works in detail

227
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,720
the downloader sent

228
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,240
the information of impacted device

229
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,639
the encryption key

230
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,040
and the secondary download server

231
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,800
address to the primary download server

232
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,279
then the primary server to create

233
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,920
the secondary server address

234
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,320
connection connected to the secondary

235
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,440
server

236
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,839
and download another malware

237
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,399
and last but not least

238
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,399
is the remotely controlled mario

239
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,880
the remotely controlled manual

240
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,600
consists of three files which are

241
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,360
the launcher

242
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,200
encrypted mario

243
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,279
and cnc server address file

244
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,920
the launcher decrypts

245
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,200
the encrypted malware and executes

246
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,959
remotely remote control functions

247
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,639
at this time

248
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,040
the cnc address list

249
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,600
is retributes from

250
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,120
the inf file

251
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,839
marvel execution is logged in

252
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,199
the server

253
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:55,519
dll.logo file

254
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,639
the operation book code

255
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,399
collects the information

256
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,560
of the infected system

257
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,800
when executed

258
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,880
for the first time and send and send it

259
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,320
to the cnc server

260
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,839
the figure here shows

261
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,320
the data structure when sending the

262
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,680
information

263
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,680
of the impacted device

264
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,440
the figure on this slide shows

265
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,240
the data structure when sending remotely

266
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,959
controlled commands

267
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,000
the remotely controlled model consists

268
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,279
of a total almost 24

269
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,440
comment

270
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,320
for example

271
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,480
the command is

272
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,519
0

273
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,720

276
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,519
in the current slide

277
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,120
this is a

278
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,079
command that performs a cmd command and

279
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,600
returns the result

280
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,160
the primary argument contains the

281
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,439
contention of the command to be executed

282
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,800
the secondary argument contains

283
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,319
a file to have the execution result

284
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,399
next

285
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,120
we will analyze the server state

286
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,839
exchange command with the boot code

287
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,560
the book called control the infected

288
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,680
system using the cnc servers

289
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,880
and the middle server

290
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,320
the cnc servers are used

291
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,279
to

292
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,959
directly execute control commands

293
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,720
to the infected system while we wire

294
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,839
them with the

295
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,120
server well while the bid server is used

296
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,279
to manage multiple

297
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,399
cnc servers

298
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,000
the operation structures i have

299
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,720
explained earlier are

300
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,079
combined

301
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,160
two created on our framework as shown in

302
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,800
the figure

303
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,160
the web server among the infected

304
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,519
systems

305
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,519
is used again as a cnc server

306
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,320
or a wiring hall page

307
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,600
to continuously increase

308
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,839
the remote control source

309
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,680
this slide shows

310
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,759
the files found on the cnc servers

311
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,959
the release that asp file

312
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,640
performs a

313
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,839
direct connection with the boot course

314
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,480
and was controlled by the mid server

315
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,160
to configure the d85

316
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,679
menus

317
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,400
tor ip address over the mid server

318
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,679
although

319
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,559
file names were different for each

320
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,400
census server

321
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,960
the argument value book code

322
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,240
used for command and control was the

323
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,559
same

324
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,320
that is why we named it as

325
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,600
the operation blue code

326
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,280
the attackers also created and use a

327
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,120
watering horse server

328
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,640
for

329
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,320
initial infiltration

330
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,720
in the first phase

331
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,600
of the warring hall attack connection

332
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,440
was

333
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,280
redirected by inserting

334
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,678
a simple malicious code script

335
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,960
in those

336
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,799
in the second page

337
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,400
our dln injector was used to inject

338
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,320
malicious functions

339
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,400
into the w3s

340
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,919
service running on the server

341
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,720
the malware injected to the w3s service

342
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,880
service monitored

343
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,760
or incoming packets

344
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,280
from the web and downloaded the

345
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,240
when a specific request was received

346
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,679
lastly

347
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,679
let me tell you about some

348
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,760
characteristics

349
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,919
of the operation book code

350
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,840
we could identify the commands used by

351
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,679
the attackers

352
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,960
in the impacted system by monitoring the

353
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,280
packet exchanges between the cnc servers

354
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,240
and the victims

355
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,720
here

356
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,120
are some of the commands

357
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,600
frequently used by the attackers

358
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,160
often analyzing

359
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,880
the commands we could see the

360
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,840
directory of the attackers

361
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,280
in the copy command

362
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,720
the attackers

363
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,440
connected drive z

364
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,720
to their directory and we found the

365
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,440
folder name in korean

366
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,360
which meant

367
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,000
to temper

368
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,720
so takers also

369
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,320
managed

370
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,240
and controlled each impacted system by

371
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,280
server name and identifier

372
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,919
we also identified

373
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,760
the open tools

374
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,400
that

375
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,000
were frequently used by the attackers

376
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,679
we found

377
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,559
that

378
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,159
the tools as shown as shown on this

379
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,679
slide

380
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,200
were used to

381
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,320
collect information over the impacted

382
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,799
system

383
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,480
this concludes my presentation

384
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,640
if you need more information

385
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,280
please refer to the paper

386
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,720
along with the presentation material

387
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,960
thank you
