2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,840
i would like to present an interesting

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,559
story about the latest research which

4
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,880
involves was matrix thing and data

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,320
excretion in world of iot

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,720
i am gabrielle verhart senior security

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,760
researcher at searchtop focusing on iot

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,760
devices such as routers gnosis and so on

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,760
my name is robert neumann i'm currently

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,360
the head of the cyber protection

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,040
operations center at acronis

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,879
and

13
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,960
the story started with very strange

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,160
messages ah small business in hungary

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,559
received an unexpectedly high monthly

16
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,520
voice sometimes in 2016

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,160
and then they were reaching out to us to

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,239
figure out what was basically happening

19
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,000
with the device or with

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,239
their

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,680
company

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,440
first they were trying to figure out

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,240
what the root cause of the

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,000
high monthly invoice was

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,400
they could track it back to short text

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,520
messages

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,600
sent to a foreign country so at this

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,840
point we were expecting that those

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,400
messages would be coming from standard

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,159
phones but instead

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,240
we figured out that there was actually a

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,799
soho router sending out them and that

33
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,320
was later in identified as a tp-link

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,360
amar

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,119
6400

36
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,159
the content of all those messages was

37
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,560
the same and it was rather specific

38
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,040
about football

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,079
before if we proceed further with the

40
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,200
research we have to step back and have a

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,520
look at the evolution of the

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,000
kind of whole router space

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,119
so

44
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,920
routers for whom and so use i

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,640
had a primary one connection for the

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,119
kids that was providing the internet

47
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,159
access and later with the birth of the

48
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,439
3g

49
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,640
standard

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,200
that was finally providing an

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,119
alternative method with acceptable

52
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,520
transfer speeds and also it was sort of

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,800
reliable it wasn't too fast but it could

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,720
be used finally as an alternative

55
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,160
solution

56
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,840
then companies started to build usb

57
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,640
modems using this 3g capability

58
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,239
and those were sometimes very useful for

59
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,400
places where traditional options options

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,480
were just absent

61
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,680
embedding these technologies resulted in

62
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,920
new devices such as the mr 6400

63
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,560
but before we we reached that

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
point

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,640
uh a step further step back

66
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,920
there were kind of mixed solutions where

67
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,400
the actually the vendor was providing a

68
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
compatibility list for the router and

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,200
you could buy a usb modem and you could

70
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,760
just plug that into the

71
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,720
modem

72
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,159
as a alternative way of connecting

73
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,680
finally these

74
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,440
new breed of devices were so kind of

75
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,959
combining the best of both worlds so one

76
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,400
was that

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,319
us the usb modems were just kind of

78
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,159
standard models they had no firewall

79
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,519
functionality

80
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,159
in the new there's you have finally

81
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,519
firewall

82
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,080
functionality and also there was a

83
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,799
fallback connection if the standard

84
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,560
broadband was not working for whatever

85
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,560
reasons

86
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,760
the investigation was started by

87
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,959
exploring

88
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,040
known vulnerabilities

89
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
we have found some of these

90
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,040
vulnerabilities such as

91
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,000
an authenticated local fire disclosure

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,200
which made possible to read out every

93
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,680
file from the device such as the

94
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,360
passwordify

95
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,959
and this issue was fixed in certain

96
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:03,280
tipling devices expect for the mr 6400

97
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,799
admission

98
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,720
we found that this

99
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,519
authenticated file disclosure

100
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,120
would be used

101
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,599
to read out the password hash of the

102
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,959
http

103
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,639
as in user

104
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,639
by reading out the adobe password file

105
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,560
and this password hash could be used to

106
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,880
log into the device without brute

107
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,639
forcing because

108
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,680
the authentication process required only

109
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,240
the password hash

110
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,080
we found an undisclosured sms related

111
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,840
vulnerability in one of the tp-ring

112
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,440
advisory

113
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,639
which was

114
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,960
pure then our investigation

115
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,000
we also found some

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,840
new ones

117
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,040
for example an authenticated information

118
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,320
leak the device info

119
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,080
page

120
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,680
post back a lot of sensitive information

121
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,360
about the device such as the mac address

122
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,240
the

123
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,280
pin code or the email address

124
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,520
and because this

125
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,039
device info page was

126
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,440
handled especially

127
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,039
it could be used to bypass the

128
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,759
authentication process

129
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,960
so

130
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,039
every get

131
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,280
request could be

132
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,080
accessed without an authentication and

133
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,000
because

134
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,960
settings were modified through get

135
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,440
request the authentication bypass could

136
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,880
be used to

137
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,360
modify any settings without

138
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,160
authentication

139
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,240
there is one

140
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,240
api endpoint which

141
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,280
could be accessed

142
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,199
with post requests it was the atf

143
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,800
config

144
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,400
which was responsible to

145
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
handle

146
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,479
modern specific commands

147
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,520
it required an authorization

148
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,240
cookie which was similar to the

149
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,800
authorization header

150
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,680
and

151
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,840
it

152
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,280
contained

153
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,960
the password hash in that

154
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,960
md5

155
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,080
password hash

156
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,560
encoded with 2bs 64.

157
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,680
the

158
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
mr

159
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,360
6400 root

160
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,800
two chipset one was a application

161
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,680
chipset responsible for

162
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,880
wi-fi and applications

163
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,520
and other was there the chipset which

164
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,440
handled the

165
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,639
modern related functionality

166
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,360
so when the

167
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,880
user

168
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,000
or the

169
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,960
admin side code ltlwebconfig

170
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,560
api handler handler

171
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,599
it was handled by the httpd

172
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,919
process in the application chipset it

173
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,719
verifies some

174
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,680
something in the

175
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,160
authorization cookie and send the

176
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,400
original json to their rtl chip set

177
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,960
which perform the

178
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,758
requested modem functionality

179
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,720
the

180
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,560
anti-web config

181
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,840
handler

182
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,800
verified whether the authorization

183
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
cookie contains

184
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,960
any string but

185
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,840
it doesn't verify the content of the

186
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,960
string

187
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,840
so

188
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,160
any content in the authorization cookie

189
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,319
could be used to

190
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,240
access the

191
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
api

192
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,639
which made possible

193
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,280
to send sms

194
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,599
changed sms settings

195
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,960
uh

196
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,039
read out

197
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:21,759
in

198
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,360
books and out books

199
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,120
messages and also to change

200
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,240
the time in the

201
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,640
chipset which was

202
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,559
contained

203
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,839
common injection vulnerability also

204
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,279
we have to note that

205
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,959
the wall up ui was rewritten

206
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,000
and the current firmware of the tp-link

207
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,120
disabling device

208
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,440
doesn't

209
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,040
contain this vulnerabilities

210
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,839
so

211
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,640
back to the football messages

212
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,920
there was a

213
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,760
long time until our honeypot device

214
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,920
was finally having different types of

215
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,080
organic messages

216
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,360
but the

217
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,399
football team advance

218
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,480
were still using the same

219
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,839
structure this focused on bigger ones

220
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,600
and top leaks

221
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,440
and all bets

222
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,360
aimed the win or drove situation

223
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,720
the

224
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,920
definition four numbers loot ordinary

225
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,800
phone numbers

226
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,920
and the

227
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,720
messages were sent

228
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,279
a day per the mesh day

229
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,440
this message is made before match fixing

230
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
but it would be some

231
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,279
conditions to met

232
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,360
and

233
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,839
because

234
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,279
the

235
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,560
bets aimed only for the win or joe

236
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,880
in case

237
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,279
it's a real bats

238
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,519
they

239
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,440
they should

240
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,079
bet the final results because it would

241
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,079
pay more

242
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,880
and also it

243
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,839
would be hard to monetize the what's in

244
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,079
this

245
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,279
attack because it would require much

246
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,760
more messages to send so we conclude

247
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,200
that

248
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,320
this may be

249
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,560
offering tips service

250
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,680
which

251
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,200
could be found on the indian tests

252
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,000
now also

253
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,640
we found that their message types

254
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,320
which were

255
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
which seems like an activation of

256
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,839
verification code

257
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,200
and

258
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,720
such as

259
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,000
form verification travel code

260
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,959
these messages seems to use the device

261
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,519
as an sms gateway

262
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,560
but the

263
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,160
content was repeating and four numbers

264
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,719
are only from a small batch

265
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,320
uh in some cases we found that

266
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,680
timestamps indicating

267
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,000
at least semi-automated processing in

268
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,640
one side because the

269
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,560
sending times

270
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,119
were very frequently

271
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,640
so at this point we found that there

272
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,279
must be money involved somehow

273
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,440
as no one was really just doing this for

274
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,880
fun or trying to bully someone into a

275
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,760
high monthly invoice and there were a

276
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,480
couple of trades so

277
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,800
by this time at least two dozen

278
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,920
different messages was discovered

279
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,040
and

280
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,480
the devices were versing all scattered

281
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,160
around the world so they were not

282
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,800
focusing on a specific location

283
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,000
the problem was that any verification on

284
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,320
the possible exploitation of any premium

285
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,680
rate services became very complicated

286
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,399
so we had no

287
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,079
further context for these messages but

288
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,480
then came up an idea as when we were

289
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,740
looking at the old going messages we see

290
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,680
[Music]

291
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,480
we have seen a small issue that

292
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,160
sometimes there are gaps between the

293
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,240
indexes they would normally just

294
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,160
increase by one but sometimes there are

295
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,720
bigger and smaller gaps and that was

296
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,959
indicating a kind of another side quest

297
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,839
to also check their inbox messages as we

298
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,920
originally didn't want to do that

299
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,240
feeling that it was something only

300
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,639
sending out mass amount of email must

301
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,920
amount of messages and there is nothing

302
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,120
really interesting in the inboxes for

303
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,680
sim cards which are inserted into

304
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,880
this type of routers

305
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,519
so the singapore case

306
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,920
this was one of those prime examples

307
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,800
where we could nicely see the indexing

308
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,760
gaps field on the upper part you see the

309
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,079
incoming messages on the on the bottom

310
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,639
you see the outgoing messages this was

311
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,120
one device located in singapore and

312
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,440
having incoming messages about completed

313
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,040
purchases on buku so boku is a big

314
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,440
e-commerce portal supporting mobile

315
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,800
payments

316
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,000
if you are adding up all the numbers

317
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
then the total amount is sort of 70 usd

318
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,800
which is not high but we don't know

319
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,120
whether that was intentionally low or it

320
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,360
was maybe just a kind of a test run

321
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,079
preparing something bigger

322
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,079
if we are looking at the outgoing

323
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,639
messages we can see that there are

324
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,120
domestic numbers being used for the

325
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,160
service so it wasn't an international a

326
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,040
short message in this case and also we

327
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,399
can observe

328
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,279
two numbers starting with plus seven

329
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,639
which are belonging to russia so those

330
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,680
numbers

331
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,440
seems to be

332
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,079
having a kind of um

333
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,959
kind of a dumb content just uh numbers

334
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,680
repeating so we were looking up the

335
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,279
number and

336
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,839
got sort of lucky as

337
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,519
this was pointing to a free sms service

338
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,720
provided on on the internet

339
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,240
for these services you can try to locate

340
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,880
local numbers in your country and you

341
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,360
can use them to send out

342
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,959
messages

343
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,199
for example if you don't want to use

344
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,800
your own phone number for registering

345
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,079
certain services per verification number

346
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,639
or response code or an authentication is

347
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,279
required you could use these services in

348
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,519
this case it was simply just used to

349
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,320
kind of test whether the actual device

350
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,240
is working and capable of sending out

351
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,800

352
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,760
the irish case there was one device in

353
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,399
ireland which seemed to be receiving

354
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,560
multiple confirmations on weekly

355
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,800
donations so these donations were too

356
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,199
big basically varying between two and

357
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,079
four euros but they were coming back on

358
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,680
a weekly basis

359
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,160
we were trying to also locate that the

360
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,040
root cause of that in the indexing

361
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,759
but that was kind of problematic as when

362
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,399
we were looking at the index numbers

363
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,399
they already started at

364
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,240
541

365
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,720
so that was sort of indicating that this

366
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,639
device might had a complete reset thing

367
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,120
before probably due to the reason that

368
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,320
they wanted to get rid of these messages

369
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,120
and likely that that was a failed

370
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,040
attempt

371
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,800
if we were looking at the

372
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,360
ongoing messages in the same time frame

373
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,560
that was bringing messages into focus

374
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,800
where we could

375
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,680
see

376
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,920
at least three different countries used

377
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,920
for destination

378
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,160
and also some

379
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,360
other numbers it was sort of the same

380
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,839
just like in the previous case

381
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,360
sending out only numbers and with no

382
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,320
specific order or the content wasn't

383
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,440
revealing more so when we tried trying

384
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,240
to kind of match these against

385
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,720
any service that initially

386
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,759
became

387
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,199
kind of challenging

388
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,199
these numbers were first appearing on

389
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,440
fake dating sites that was a kind of a

390
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,399
dead end

391
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,120
and then at some point we finally found

392
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,399
the perfect match uh on one of the

393
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,440
premium ray of an sms series on the web

394
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,320
offering premium rate services

395
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,559
so when we were investigating a little

396
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,439
bit more that was also revealing that

397
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,240
there are similar services sometimes

398
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,240
it's only the

399
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,280
web ui changing and if you are going a

400
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,799
little bit deeper digging into the

401
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,199
company then you will see the very same

402
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,919
faces turning up as who is working for

403
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,439
the company

404
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,919
and nothing else is basically different

405
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,160
so just like kind of a rebranding of the

406
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,679
very same service

407
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,840
we were collecting all the numbers from

408
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,840
here and

409
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,160
try to kind of cross match with all the

410
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,799
logs we had so that was revealing a

411
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,679
couple of exact matches but beside those

412
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,320
exact matches there were a lot of other

413
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,520
cases where the numbers were only off by

414
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,559
like the last two or three digits

415
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,600
as the

416
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
by this time our looks were already

417
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,000
covering a time frame of five years

418
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,240
that was indicating that these services

419
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,240
are frequently changing numbers and

420
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,320
those could be very well belonging to

421
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,480
the same service just going back a

422
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,280
couple of years

423
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,440
then

424
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,960
previous cases were

425
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,559
mainly falling into the low volume

426
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,559
category so we had one in poland which

427
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,840
was

428
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,480
just a little bit higher in terms of

429
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,720
download the photography messages so

430
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,200
there was one device located in poland

431
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,240
having

432
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,280
a kind of an incoming message obviously

433
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,880
the first index which was resembling of

434
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,440
a proper monthly invoice coming from

435
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,960
t-mobile

436
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,720
so you can see that that's having the

437
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,320
index number one

438
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,280
and

439
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,720
if you are translating the message is

440
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,919
basically an invoice and uh

441
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,000
the whoever the owner of the device was

442
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,919
had to pay 202 zlotys for the services

443
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,919
so that's like this is as usual you are

444
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,320
buying a new device you are enabling the

445
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,919
services and this is the first message

446
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,919
message you receive

447
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,720
then just a month later

448
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,559
there are a couple of things happening

449
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,400
if you are looking at the index number

450
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,600
that's already over

451
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,600
1000 and if you look at the very same

452
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,160
message the amount of the monthly

453
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,679
invoice is much higher close to almost a

454
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,360
thousand zlotys

455
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,200
so let's have a look of what was

456
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,400
happening

457
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,080
with the ongoing messages at the same

458
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,600
time frame

459
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,320
so we have a couple of test messages

460
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,400
which are basically using

461
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,640
the you know the same phone number as

462
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,039
for the content or sometimes using test

463
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,360
or something else and then

464
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,440
you have your your phone verification

465
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,840
number and a constant number and that's

466
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,440
starting and there are over 1000

467
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,160
messages with the very same content

468
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,559
so we could observe the similar

469
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,559
campaigns where there are test messages

470
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,640
used sometimes

471
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,080
the content is the phone number

472
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,960
sometimes it's test or tst or asd or

473
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,679
something similar for this we can see

474
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,440
that the as a result of these messages

475
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,720
there is at least a damage of over 200

476
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,240
usd

477
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,159
for the owner of the device because

478
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,919
that's how much

479
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,159
he or she had to pay for that

480
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,840
if we were kind of going a little bit

481
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,000
further also looking at the next month

482
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,640
and the month after then the amount of

483
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,120
the monthly invoices were going back to

484
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,799
the very same 202 so it was business as

485
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,880
usual after that it was only happening

486
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,799
for one month probably because whoever

487
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,039
had this was reporting the incident and

488
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,200
then they were kind of just putting a

489
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,400
bearing on the sim card so there was no

490
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,120
possibility to send to foreign numbers

491
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,520
anymore

492
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,120
and then let's have a look at some of

493
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,799
the top guns

494
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,919
so out of a lot of cases there were two

495
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,600
which are outstanding

496
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,880
both these cases were having over 10k

497
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,559
messages sent out

498
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,320
there was one device located in

499
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,880
singapore which had

500
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,159
over 9 000 of the same message types

501
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,120
sent

502
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,919
to one phone number in russia the phone

503
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,240
number was never changing the content

504
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,400
was slightly changing

505
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,520
it was always send code is and then

506
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,200
a number

507
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,280
which was kind of different

508
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,440
we believe that that might be due to the

509
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,919
reason that they wanted to avoid throw

510
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,480
detection on the career side

511
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,159
but they weren't changing their content

512
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,360
or messages beyond that and due to the

513
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,520
massive amount of messages this whole

514
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,840
campaign lasted for

515
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,679
a couple of months

516
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,400
looking at the number we couldn't find

517
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,960
on the exact match with the some of

518
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,720
these premium red

519
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,440
sms services but this was also kind of

520
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,799
close enough and the format and

521
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,200
everything also indicated that it would

522
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,799
be probably belonging to the very same

523
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,000
category and then probably the most

524
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,679
interesting

525
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,559
case we bumped into that was

526
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,799
located in in israel

527
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,480
and it was containing

528
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,120
10k of what looked like grammatically

529
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,760
correct english sentences the only

530
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,880
problem with that was they made no sense

531
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,840
at all

532
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,240
so you can look at the messages

533
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,440
these were

534
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,320
perfectly fine sentences but the content

535
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,039
was off we were trying to kind of cross

536
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,760
match these with anything we could find

537
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,480
and a couple of youtube song titles came

538
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,600
up or also kind of quotes from movies

539
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,360
and books

540
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,200
the idea here was the kind of the same

541
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,480
that these were probably used to kind of

542
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
avoid fraud detection

543
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,559
for the previous cases where you have

544
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,080
kind of a simplistic message with the

545
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,400
send code and the code some rules could

546
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,960
be applied to detect those for these

547
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,200
messages all the messages are completely

548
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,640
different so it's kind of hard to

549
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,400
detect them

550
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,600
also something else to

551
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,640
notify about this case was

552
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,720
that that kind of the time

553
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,400
they were using for sending out the

554
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,720
messages if you look at the indexing and

555
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,559
also kind of the same time

556
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,679
they are all constant so that's also

557
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,640
kind of

558
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
interesting because this was the almost

559
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,600
the only time we've seen that someone

560
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,280
was ever of the vulnerability in which

561
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,679
could be led to changing the lte time

562
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,120
more than that

563
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,360
to achieve kind of this output

564
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,240
you would need to constantly send the

565
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,320
time after sending out one message

566
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,840
because if you are just sending the

567
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,039
setting the

568
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,320
system time then normally seconds would

569
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,600
increase as they normally should so for

570
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,799
these they were going back and setting

571
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,880
the system time every time prior to

572
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,960
sending out a new message

573
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,520
and then due to that reason we couldn't

574
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,279
really

575
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,919
estimate how long this campaign lasted

576
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,120
but probably it was similar to the

577
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,799
previous russian one

578
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,880
even if it wasn't a couple of months but

579
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,840
it was surely multiple weeks

580
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,919
then we were looking at the content of

581
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,120
the messages like what else we could do

582
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,720
with them

583
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,600
one idea was that these might be using

584
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,360
acoustic cipher

585
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,240
but unfortunately looking at

586
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,720
a couple of dozen messages wasn't

587
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
revealing anything else

588
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,880
not only that the

589
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,559
timing would be off and that would make

590
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,600
anything

591
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,880
much more

592
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,440
uh problematic from an accuracy cipher

593
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,559
point of view

594
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,520
but the the indexes were

595
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,919
never off on the device itself so we

596
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,640
could probably properly identify

597
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,600
the order of the messages sent out

598
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
when we were looking even further then

599
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,640
we were only kind of bumping into

600
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,760
one side that was

601
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,080
having messages

602
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,880
like exact matches from these at least a

603
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,120
couple of months so sites like course

604
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,080
hero or script are having documents

605
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,440
where you can locate the very same

606
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,400
messages there these documents are not

607
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,799
contained containing anything else but

608
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,960
that wasn't really providing any useful

609
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,080
additional context for research for this

610
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,840
typical this specific message type

611
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,039
the idea of data exfiltration was

612
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,919
constantly coming up and we were

613
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,000
dropping it multiple times during the

614
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,840
the whole research

615
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,640
the reason was that we felt that the

616
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,960
base idea of sending out smaller amount

617
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,200
of data such as login credentials or

618
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,840
passwords or access codes that was all

619
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,039
possible mastery was all possible with

620
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,919
these devices it wouldn't take too much

621
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,320
to use some symmetric uh crypto like aes

622
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,720
and also like this base64

623
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,440
and use the credentials password encrypt

624
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,240
them encode them and send out

625
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,520
also kind of the same way using for some

626
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,000
of the smaller document files you could

627
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,760
split them into

628
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,080
chunks which are

629
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,760
having the proper

630
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,200
160

631
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,400
character limitation of the sms messages

632
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,320
and then you could kind of just rebuild

633
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,200
the messages on the other side

634
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,840
also it's rather strange that endpoints

635
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,200
or servers in a company environment

636
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,159
would connect to external routers just

637
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,559
for proxying data to towards maybe a

638
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,000
burner phone

639
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,679
and in this case iit security people and

640
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,840
also people working in

641
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,080
security operations centers might not be

642
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,000
prepared for such a scenario when they

643
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,840
are looking at the logs

644
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,919
still we were not really having anything

645
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,440
closer to this

646
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,559
and

647
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,960
almost at the very last point when we

648
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,799
were concluding the research we were

649
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,799
bumping into one case

650
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,080
as you can see there it was very unusual

651
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,240
there seems to be a test message being

652
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,919
sent out and then there is another one

653
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,600
trying to access

654
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,679
a server by the ip address and also

655
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,080
using the login password which is admin

656
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,600
admin in this case

657
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,679
unfortunately we couldn't figure out

658
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,679
anything more about the server

659
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,799
as it was already offline the time of

660
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,600
discovery of this was a couple of years

661
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,679
of looking at the time of when the

662
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,720
messages were sent

663
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,520
and at the end we had to conclude what

664
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,480
we feel that we felt this

665
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,640
whole operation was for

666
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,120
so running football team campaigns for

667
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,399
over a year after the initial discovery

668
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,799
was happening without kind of any

669
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,120
additional message times

670
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,039
at the very same time the number of

671
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,520
exploitable devices were significantly

672
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,000
growing both in location and of course

673
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,679
in numbers

674
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,320
if someone wanted to create a service

675
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,919
focusing on

676
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,000
text messages like this

677
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,039
that was

678
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,840
providing a complete anonymity for the

679
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,799
senders as even if someone was kind of

680
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,559
gathering the device

681
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,679
itself

682
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,279
it would be unable to kind of verify who

683
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,960
the sender was as using the

684
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,880
vulnerability is acting the very same

685
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,120
way like someone would be sending out

686
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,000
messages using the the ui of the device

687
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,159
because it's using the very same api and

688
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,039
of course there is no uh ip logging

689
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,520
implemented because that would normally

690
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,520
makes no sense at all

691
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,919
also we had signs of implementation of

692
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,600
load balancing so unfortunately due to

693
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,760
the time restriction we couldn't

694
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,080
talk about all the different message

695
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,480
types and campaigns we observed

696
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,960
but for one we were

697
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,799
having a case where

698
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,600
we could identify the very same meshes

699
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,480
message types and the very same content

700
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,600
being sent out parallel on two

701
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,760
completely different devices that was

702
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,679
indicating that there is some kind of

703
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,559
load balancing implemented

704
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,799
likely due to have a loan low number of

705
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,840
messages being sent so one sim card is

706
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,159
not going to be easily blocked and if

707
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,480
there are a couple of thousand devices

708
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,200
up for take on the internet this

709
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,760
providing uh better use of such a

710
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,080
service and also the campaigns we

711
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,960
observed were very broad scale both in

712
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,919
numbers

713
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,159
of the outgoing messages and also in

714
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,880
content so what we found was really

715
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,840
happening here is someone slowly build a

716
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,640
service uh which could be uh rented out

717
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,960
for whoever wanted to use and send out

718
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,480
messages unanimously

719
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,559
thus for the conclusion

720
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,399
there are a couple of issues that the

721
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,520
general state of the security of

722
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,679
internet connected devices such as

723
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,720
routers or iot devices is only slowly

724
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,679
improving that's been a problem going on

725
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,279
for years but the current state is not

726
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,480
much better than a couple of years back

727
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,640
one of the main issues with that is that

728
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,799
there is unfortunately no properly

729
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,360
implemented auto update functionality

730
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,840
and that's only done by a selected few

731
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,080
vendors that rest are still using the

732
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,240
old-fashioned ways of them people would

733
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,039
need to download firmware files from the

734
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,399
internet and then login into the

735
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,760
web ui of the device apply the firmware

736
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,399
restart sometimes also reconfigure it if

737
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,080
something went wrong

738
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,520
and that's just something we cannot

739
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,600
really expect from

740
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,919
people at home or also sometimes it's

741
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,440
even problematic for uh servos and

742
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
kind of small companies

743
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,000
also there is a problem with hardware

744
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,399
versus software balance so

745
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,640
the vendors are mainly interested in

746
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,519
selling hardware and generating revenue

747
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,519
that would be of course no problem and

748
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,640
they are trying to make sure that

749
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,440
the

750
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,120
devices are working for an extended

751
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,679
period of time so for example in the

752
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,640
case of mr 6400

753
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,039
there there are like five different

754
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,000
hardware revisions up to date of course

755
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,640
that could be due to different reasons

756
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,640
like trying to change

757
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,799
internal components and reduce the price

758
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,159
everything else

759
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,200
but compared to the software side that's

760
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,840
still sometimes feels a necessary must

761
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,880
and

762
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,600
even though that there is a completely

763
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,120
new firmware for this device

764
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,080
in general the software size seems to be

765
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,000
lacking compared to the hardware one for

766
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,840
most of the vendors

767
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,240
also one big issue in specific case was

768
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,960
that

769
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,279
exploiting functionality which has no

770
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,519
noticeable effect on the device main

771
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,240
operation is making discovery very

772
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,960
challenging so in case if it was just a

773
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,279
standard coin miner then the cpu would

774
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,640
likely overload or if you had a mass

775
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,720
amount of oil going queries then it

776
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,120
could be adidas and there are ways to

777
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,559
locate those

778
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,279
for

779
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,679
on sms base functionality

780
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,000
uh it was very tough because everything

781
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,480
else was properly working on the device

782
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,279
and we could only kind of get involved

783
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,320
as someone was reporting the high

784
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,159
monthly invoice

785
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,960
as for the result this can be kind of

786
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,600
ranging from just an unexpectedly high

787
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,360
monthly invoice and that would be the

788
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,200
kind of the

789
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,840
the smallest issue especially that if

790
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,840
it's just a kind of a one-off then

791
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,080
usually carriers are resolving that

792
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,200
and

793
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,360
at the end the end user doesn't really

794
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,960
have to pay

795
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,919
because

796
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,799
it was something they couldn't kind of

797
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,640
prevent happening

798
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,600
the bigger problem is if for whatever

799
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,640
reason that the device is

800
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,120
participating in criminal activities

801
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,200
because then someone could end up in the

802
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,919
very same unfortunate situation than if

803
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,159
the home wifi was hacked and the

804
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,799
neighbor or someone else was accessing

805
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,679
web pages or services which are not

806
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,799
really on the legal side of things

807
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,799
and in general as for the main

808
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,399
conclusion

809
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,000
looking at this case it was also

810
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,679
making us

811
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,679
feel that the

812
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,679
boundaries of traditional and cyber

813
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,039
crime are increasingly overlapping

814
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,919
before this the kind of phone related

815
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,039
crimes were considered as a traditional

816
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,399
crime but since those services were

817
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,440
integrated into iot devices

818
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,760
that the boundaries are much more

819
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,639
overlapping than in the decades before

820
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,879
if you have any questions

821
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,520
