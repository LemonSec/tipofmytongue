00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,719
hello everyone my name is shankar i'm

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,400
working as a threat researcher at norton

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,679
lifelock

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,759
today i'm going to present my topic on

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,760
hunting analysis and detection of

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,000
android soccer let's get started

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,400
stockwear applications are primarily

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,960
used for tracking spouses friends

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,039
employees etc

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,519
the application would be installed on a

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,960
victim's device

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,320
it will gather

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,920
sensitive data like your whatsapp

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,559
message location details and transmit

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,640
them to a remote location

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,079
now

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,680
apart from transmitting the gathered

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,640
data

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,719
they also try to avoid attract

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,800
attracting users attention by using

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
different persistent techniques like

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,960
hiding icons prevent users from deleting

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,360
the app

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,360
where they can be found

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,359
stock aware applications are widespread

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,359
and they are made available to public

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,080
via play store third-party app stores

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,519
and directly sold from the vendor

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,080
websites uh play store remote most of

31
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,760
the stock wire application but

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,080
third-party app stores did not they are

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,600
still out there in the third party app

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,479
stores for anyone to download for free

35
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,759
and use it

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,759
for stalking the victims

37
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,920
the next slides let's see some of the

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,000
persistent techniques uh used to buy

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,159
those stockwear apps are taken from

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,040
different app stores

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,240
first one is apc tools it is a parental

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,880
control application from playstore

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,280
it can remotely track your location sms

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,600
and call logs the interesting part is

45
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,159
the persistent technique used in the app

46
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,560
any atoms to uninstall the app uh would

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,079
take you away from the app in full

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,320
screen uh thereby relate thereby

49
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,640
preventing the deletion of the app

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,320
this is achieved using the perform

51
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,799
global action method from accessibility

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,719
service class

53
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,360
the perform global action

54
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,920
with the method with argument one is a

55
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,799
back press event

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,720
second one is hands a location track

57
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,560
tracking application from third party

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,680
app store

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,000
it silently transmits your phone

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,400
location details to a remote ip address

61
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,480
of your choice and there are two

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,000
malicious behavior

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,520
the persistent technique is the

64
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,120
application launcher imitating the

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
settings icon uh moreover the

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,280
application menu can only be opened

67
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,840
using a secret code which is uh known

68
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,879
only to the stalker

69
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,480
more examples on launcher icons on

70
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,800
column one tracker is another location

71
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,160
tracking program

72
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,239
it transmits your location details to a

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,200
remote

74
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,400
dashboard

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,920
the malicious behavior is that the

76
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,319
application can hide the launcher icon

77
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,239
completely from the app drawer if you're

78
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,400
using android 9 or below

79
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,239
column 2 is an application from our

80
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,400
in-house database

81
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,480
and the suspicious behavior is that the

82
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,080
app goes unnoticed by using the

83
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,040
transparent icon

84
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,599
uh last example is a spycam application

85
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,760
from a third party app store it takes

86
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,000
pictures or videos on a regular interval

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and transmit them to a configured email

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
address the pictures taken won't be

89
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
visible in the gallery this is taken

90
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,560
care by the dot no media file

91
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,720
no media file is a hidden file um the

92
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,480
file is created by the application to

93
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,319
avoid pictures or videos showing up in

94
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,080
the gallery

95
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,480
spy camps are still actively used only

96
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,560
in the last nine months we had close to

97
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,640
a thousand detections on different spy

98
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,319
cam variants

99
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,159
so these are some of the persistent

100
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,959
techniques used by the stock of our apps

101
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,560
in the next slide so you will see how to

102
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,920
hunt them using search engine operators

103
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,799
um some of us could have used the search

104
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,640
operators for debugging websites

105
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,439
penetration testing and os and hunting

106
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,200
we found that it can also be used for

107
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,439
hunting software applications

108
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,519
among the popular search engines google

109
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,799
provides the most number of search

110
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,400
operators followed by bing

111
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,879
here are some examples for hunting

112
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,120
potential stock of our applications you

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,840
may check them all

114
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,920
what do you need exactly to do the

115
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,079
hunting drive search operators and

116
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,358
keywords

117
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,279
consider including the protocol details

118
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,358
in your search queries file type can

119
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,800
also

120
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,720
come handy sometimes

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,400
if you're looking for iocs you may use

122
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
csv or txt file because usually they are

123
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,479
published in those formats

124
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,639
next you need to gather keywords

125
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,639
read application descriptions package

126
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,080
name

127
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,919
pay careful attention to the title and

128
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,000
the content of stalker wire vendor

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,120
websites

130
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,759
stock aware apps also available in

131
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,840
multiple languages so

132
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,160
consider using languages in your search

133
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,560
queries

134
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
no

135
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,160
after you after you have collected the

136
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,560
search operators and keywords uh we can

137
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,479
automate the hunting process uh wire

138
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,759
automation uh if you google uh for uh

139
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,759
alternative if you google alternatives

140
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,759
for uh play store you may spot five or

141
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,759
ten third party app stores but in

142
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,840
reality there are plenty of them

143
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,919
manually hunting stock aware apps in all

144
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,759
the app stores will be a time consuming

145
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,639
task

146
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,479
we need an approach to hunt them program

147
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,560
programmatically that's where serp api

148
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,039
comes in

149
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,840
let's see a couple of examples on how to

150
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,520
hunt stock over apps using search

151
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,000
operators uh use case one uh finding

152
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
stock aware vendor websites

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,520
the related search operator can be

154
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,960
useful for hunting stock aware

155
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,199
competitors for instance when related

156
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,960
search operator is used in combination

157
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,120
with the vendor url it presents us with

158
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,199
a list of stock aware competitors the

159
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,800
search results

160
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,639
taking each of those url and repeating

161
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,400
the same steps may reveal potential

162
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,840
stock aware vendors

163
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,440
the same technique applies for

164
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,600
collecting third-party app stores urls

165
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,919
second use case finding spy cams on app

166
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:58,960
stores

167
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,800
you can find potential app stores again

168
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,639
using the same related search operator

169
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,600
with an app store your urls input now

170
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,919
take each app store url and use it with

171
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,840
the site operator plus keyword related

172
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,080
to spycam it would get you the spycam

173
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,280
apps from

174
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,840
app stores

175
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,199
we did some experiments with the search

176
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,840
operators and serp apis we did see a

177
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,759
related search operator was useful but

178
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,919
there are drawbacks to it

179
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,639
the latest uh operator did not work for

180
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,759
uh new stock five vendors um google says

181
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,720
related

182
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,960
operator is not refreshed in real time

183
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,479
meaning um

184
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,639
new stock where apps may not show up but

185
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,720
we show up sometime later

186
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,400
i read an article that it works for

187
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,840
larger domains

188
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,800
and often vendor vendor websites go out

189
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,880
of business and the newer ones may come

190
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
up and they are not indexed by search

191
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,639
engine in real time

192
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,919
we also notice

193
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,759
spam urls popping up

194
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,080
after doing queries by combining other

195
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,520
search operators like index off

196
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,319
uh here are some hints that may be

197
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,720
helpful for hunting uh run a search on

198
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,960
google for keywords later to spy or

199
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,120
vendor name and sometimes it presents us

200
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,800
with the ads of popular phone tracking

201
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
vendors if you find the stock wire

202
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,840
vendors

203
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,560
facebook page scroll down to check the

204
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,120
related page it might link you to other

205
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,919
vendors pages

206
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,479
the related search lists at the end of

207
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,560
the search page can also be useful

208
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,400
if you're using search operators it can

209
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,199
help refine or expand your current query

210
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,960
searching for a vendor name sometimes

211
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,720
reveals just talk about competitor names

212
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,240
as well

213
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
right above that you may also support

214
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,440
the people also search for box that may

215
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,960
link you sometimes to other stock aware

216
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,520
vendors

217
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,759
so that's it about hunting let's move on

218
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,400
to detection

219
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,720
we have seen majority of the stock of

220
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,960
our apps in the market does not employ

221
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
any code protection techniques

222
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,199
most of the features like sms recording

223
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,960
clipboard etc

224
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,120
rely on the standard apis

225
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,639
offered by these classes that leaves

226
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,240
them vulnerable to static detection

227
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,639
social messaging apps are popular these

228
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,960
day stock web applications also target

229
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,879
target social messaging apps when they

230
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,639
do it they track multiple social

231
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,560
messenger applications there are two

232
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,000
techniques widely used to extract

233
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,360
messages from them

234
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,960
one is directly accessing the private

235
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,400
database files

236
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,840
the point to notice here is um

237
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,319
it is suspicious when any app uses two

238
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,559
or more database names of popular social

239
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,120
messaging apps moreover the messaging

240
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,958
apps database names

241
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,360
does not change often we also noticed a

242
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,599
similar implementation in cat watchful

243
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,040
sp app m spy free spy and other vendors

244
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,279
uh the second implementation is by

245
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,360
tapping the notification message uh by

246
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,000
tapping the messages from notification

247
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,680
instead of accessing the private files

248
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,440
just talking about apps extract messages

249
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,360
from the notification

250
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,040
similar implementation were also seen in

251
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,839
talk log flexi spy mm guardian and spicy

252
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,320
vendors

253
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,720
uh this slide contains some of the

254
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,600
sensitive and commonly used uh methods

255
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,080
constants and artifacts uh found in the

256
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,640
software applications um that primary

257
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,720
clip change listener is for clipboard

258
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,279
media projection for screen capturing no

259
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,200
media is usually used in spy camps

260
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,279
foreign artifacts we have database names

261
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,080
of whatsapp facebook and viber

262
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,680
we can combine some of them and use it

263
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,040
for detection

264
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
while using db names

265
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,279
use wildcard because implementation

266
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,040
implementations are usually like slash

267
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,360
data slash data com whatsapp and file

268
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,600
path

269
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,320
so to sum up

270
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,560
change the sensitive method names um

271
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,000
class names and when you include

272
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,320
forensic artifacts um

273
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,160
linux files constants used in the

274
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,000
application it would make the detection

275
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,080
stronger moreover the android api

276
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,760
constants and artifacts don't change

277
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,959
often

278
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,959
we have tested this method and it was

279
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,640
effective in detecting complex talk

280
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,120
about apps fuse spyware and rat variants

281
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,920
about drawback the technique does not

282
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,959
work for simple programs like tracker

283
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,839
it application

284
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,760
go it may cause wrong classification if

285
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,560
used and apparently the decay could fail

286
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,320
if the app use any code protection

287
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,800
techniques

288
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,279
let's see a quick demo uh using the

289
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,160
android python library

290
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,279
the pocs are quite straightforward

291
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,680
implementation all the indicators are

292
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,640
defined in a json file

293
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,279
the commonly used and sensitive api

294
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,519
calls artifacts uh linux files etc um

295
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,720
that

296
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,760
the classes methods uh constants used in

297
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,839
the application uh can be obtained using

298
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,480
the android analysis object

299
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,320
now all the indicators defined in the

300
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,680
json file

301
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,920
will be run over a loop

302
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
to check if they are presented app

303
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,079
they are found the next step is

304
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,600
evaluation

305
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,160
the logic class takes care of it it

306
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,480
checks for suspicious patterns like an

307
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,320
app cannot use two or more database

308
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,399
names of popular messaging apps and

309
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,880
others based on our guidelines and then

310
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,640
it locks the verdict on the console

311
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
i'm i'm going to use a

312
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,959
exynos stock web application for the

313
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,959
demo

314
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,600
okay

315
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,680
the cross reference for each method is

316
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,240
also locked on the console and finally

317
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,399
the verdict along with the stock wire

318
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,399
type

319
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,320
with that we come to the last section of

320
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,720
the talk

321
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,120
stockwear threadless is a platform for

322
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,680
sharing samples metadata related to

323
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,360
stock web applications

324
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,200
currently we have several av vendors

325
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,279
universities and independent researchers

326
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,200
contributing to this platform

327
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,720
of course they can all seat and download

328
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
the samples from the portal

329
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,800
if you are an av vendor or university or

330
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,480
independent researcher working on stock

331
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
by topic we correctly invite you to join

332
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,120
us

333
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,160
um

334
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,639
please follow the link we can we can get

335
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,240
in touch with you

336
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,079
we would also like to take this moment

337
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,440
and thank all the members and

338
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,480
contributors uh for your contributions i

339
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,240
it really helped us in the research

340
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,760
this was an uh interesting uh find

341
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
reported by one of our contributors

342
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,519
amrita university

343
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,360
it is a simple application that guides a

344
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,839
user to download a stock aware program

345
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,320
