00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,480
hello we are s2w talent team we will

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,280
give a presentation on operation utah

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,720
related to the kimski group

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,520
first i'm jackie kim now working at

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,680
blacksmiths over thailand as to

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,599
principal researcher

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,160
i'm mainly researching and tracking

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,720
about apt threat actors

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,440
and this year is third time giving our

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,640
presentation at preview i hope that next

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,280
year really will be opening prague

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,239
hello i'm sojourn new at blacksmiths of

14
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,960
thailand as a senior researcher i used

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,840
to research about ft threat actors but i

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,719
mainly focus focusing on cyber crime

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,680
actor such as ransomware group

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,800
of course i'm also interested in the fpd

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,480
actors

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,399
and i'm kyongju kwak

21
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,920
director of s2w's ti group holland

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,200
i'm mainly

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,760
interested in state sponsored thread

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,960
actor ransomware and any cyber crime

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,840
related things as shown in the slide you

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,840
can see that what i talked about in the

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,080
past

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,640
let me tell you about our cti group

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,759
briefly

30
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,479
we call our group as talon

31
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,200
it is comprised of three teams such as

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,320
blacksmith hustles unreal

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,400
as shown in the slide in case of

34
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,920
blacksmith

35
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,799
this team is for apt intelligence thread

36
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,920
actor tracking and detailed malware

37
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,200
analysis

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,880
next one is hustles they are mainly

39
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,600
focusing on deep dark web monitoring and

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,240
cryptocurrency tracking by using our

41
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,079
solution and many other awesome tools

42
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,399
last one is unreal

43
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,200
this team's goal is making impossible

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,680
things possible and

45
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,119
core technology research

46
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,520
here is the agenda of our talk firstly

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,400
introduction we will explain about apple

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,800
seed which is the factor of kim's key

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,879
group and next one is the main content

50
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,599
of our talk operation newton

51
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,400
we will show you what the operation

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,200
newton is with analysis of full chain

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,680
attack that targeting scientific

54
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,000
engineering researchers

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,879
thirdly we will elucidate

56
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,519
the correlation analysis results by

57
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,239
using offset failed cases lastly

58
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,640
conclusion

59
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,840
now here is the introduction

60
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,160
we will focus on kim's key group today

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,560
this group is exposed to many threat

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,800
hunters because their activities are

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,640
very aggressive and

64
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,800
i think they don't care about being

65
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
discovered

66
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,120
sometimes people said about ginsky like

67
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,239
this they are persistent

68
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,440
but they

69
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,680
are as hell or not advanced

70
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,560
however we don't agree with that it's

71
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,760
only the view of threat hunter

72
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,720
actual damage is more critical than we

73
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,280
usually imagine

74
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,200
now start talking about apple seed

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,440
basically this is the backdoor of the

76
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,440
kinsky group

77
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,440
it was first observed in may 2019

78
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,000
at that time each distribution url and

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
ip is as shown in the slide

80
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,120
and here are pdb passes of appleseed you

81
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,760
can see this after decoding it

82
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,040
we already talked about these pdb passes

83
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,400
at the freebie 2019

84
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,120
one of the big features of appleseed is

85
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,799
double xor decoding routine

86
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,519
in needs various streams for the

87
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,959
execution of malicious codes

88
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,560
including the encoded api function names

89
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,360
and this method of decoding after wxor

90
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,159
has been used continuously from the from

91
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,560
the initial version

92
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,639
this specific decoding method can be

93
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,040
said to be one of the important factors

94
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,199
when hunting and analyzing melissa's

95
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,320
codes in addition as mentioned before

96
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,720
double xlr decoding routine was included

97
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
in the malware discovered in operation

98
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,120
newton

99
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,520
the main characteristics of apple seeds

100
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,040
are briefly summarized as follows

101
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,759
in case of masquerading

102
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,280
and decoy using the normal name like a

103
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,600
document software something like that

104
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,880
and it registers registry as scheduler

105
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,560
for automated execution for persistence

106
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,800
furthermore it monitors the folder

107
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,120
keyboard screen capture usb continuously

108
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,680
appleseed communicate with c2 server to

109
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,120
unload and download for data breach with

110
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,600
fake pdf header and extra encoding

111
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,919
but encryption method has been recently

112
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,960
changed to using rxa1 public key and not

113
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,759
used server just using email as see to

114
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,720
server example emails are as shown in

115
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,759
the slide

116
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,000
according to several conference talks

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,080
and analysis reports

118
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,199
released by secret researchers

119
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,280
gimski attacked various industries

120
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,560
for example

121
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,960
in case of government especially foreign

122
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,680
governments ministries and diplomatic

123
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,880
missions

124
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,520
and national security especially with

125
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,919
regards to national security policy

126
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,759
depends on north korea related affairs

127
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,400
and next one is aerospace and defense

128
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,479
and also international relations and

129
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,000
sanctions nuclear related policy

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,960
and lots of niche academia and research

131
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,560
especially in the nuclear space

132
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,400
today we are going to talk about the

133
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,280
operation which targeted academia and

134
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,680
research sector

135
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,639
during investigate the operation newton

136
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,080
we also found appleseed factor

137
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,400
for that region we call this instant as

138
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,919
operation newton

139
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,319
now i will pass mike to the surgeon

140
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,120
in november 2020 we conducted an

141
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,240
analysis and instant response after

142
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,039
obtaining intelligence on an instant

143
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,039
that targeting scientific and

144
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,880
engineering researchers

145
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,080
in this process it was possible to catch

146
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,280
the actual ttps about the kimski group's

147
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,639
attack which used appleseed which was

148
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,520
not known publicly

149
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,840
through simple account hijacking and

150
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,639
phishing males internal network control

151
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,720
and lateral movement attacks were

152
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,280
performed and even during the actual

153
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,160
response continuous attacks such as

154
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,840
interior spearfishing through

155
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,319
intermittent transmission were carried

156
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,440
out

157
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,639
in the actual accident on advanced

158
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,120
exploits such as browser generate was

159
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,759
not used but the surprisingly simple

160
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,720
vulnerability was used to increase the

161
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,880
attack probably

162
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,360
additionally the sensitive information

163
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,520
leaked through the phishing object was

164
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,080
exploited to take over multiple internet

165
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
servers

166
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,199
this is an overview of operation newton

167
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,840
the first step starts by acquiring

168
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,879
low-end credential net necessary for ml

169
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,879
access through a spear phishing mail

170
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,120
attack that can trigger a windmill

171
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,680
vulnerability and send it to the phasing

172
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,639
server

173
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,280
and then collect sensitivity information

174
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,599
from the leaked accounts

175
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,560
next

176
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,960
the attacker collects vpn access

177
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,440
information as well as server access

178
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,319
account and use them to access the

179
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,160
internet network

180
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,960
after that download and execute a

181
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,440
reverse share on an internet server that

182
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,919
the attacker can access to

183
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,400
next step is perform letter movement

184
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,720
using oled collected server access

185
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,919
accounts

186
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,960
for persistence download and execute web

187
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,919
shell reverse share and apple seeds

188
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,960
serum interpreter cnc server

189
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,159
seventh step explains the stolen

190
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,880
information from each server to the to

191
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,120
the external server

192
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,839
finally using all the obtained credencer

193
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,919
information the attackers send

194
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,760
additional spear fishing emails

195
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,160
containing appleseed mario to other

196
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,800
insiders

197
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,440
the attacker sends a spearfishing email

198
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,320
that can trigger a memo vulnerability to

199
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,760
it step

200
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,080
when the email is opened the

201
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,720
vulnerability shows the phishing site

202
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,760
disguised as a normal remnant site

203
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,160
then the login credential input by

204
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,480
victor victim is linked to the

205
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,040
attacker's surfacing server

206
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,279
the article cannot collect sensitive

207
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,600
information from the leaked credential

208
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,560
kim's case known my link turkey metal on

209
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,839
the barrel okay.php was also used in

210
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,680
this operation to send cpr phishing mail

211
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,680
the ipa address of wallet

212
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,680
info.esy.es was often used by gimski

213
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,680
group for other facing operation

214
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,040
the title uses provocative words such as

215
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,560
urgent notification and application

216
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,600
but the body of email just contains only

217
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,440
one simple sentence

218
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,000
these are meaning erroneous sending

219
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,800
mirrors were never being restored or

220
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,839
error

221
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,920
this can make people who read these

222
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,519
smells just to pass it

223
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,480
but behind these simple sentences the

224
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,000
vulnerability causing html and ml

225
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,120
injection

226
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,360
that connects to the optical sufficient

227
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,160
server is hidden

228
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,720
this code was javascript file on the

229
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,000
article server with the victim side and

230
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,560
the name of the victim organization as a

231
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,560
parameters

232
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,360
html injection is executed by

233
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,440
analytics.js which is called first

234
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
next

235
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,279
bootstrap.js executes and loads of

236
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,360
phishing page that mimics the victim

237
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,000
organization's email will be paid

238
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,880
when a user enters a loan credential and

239
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,800
attempts to loading

240
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,480
the entered keyboards are sent

241
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,480
g8.js along with the cookie values

242
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,200
after that the article logs into the

243
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,440
intermediate system through the store

244
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,720
will be loading credentials and access

245
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,160
sensitive information such as vpn access

246
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,079
information and server access accounts

247
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,839
then download and execute a share on an

248
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,480
internal symbol that the attacker can

249
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,279
access to

250
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,760
perform lateral movements using alert

251
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,240
collected server access account

252
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,040
account the article was able to access

253
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,360
quite a few internet servers not only

254
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,279
windows photos linux servers

255
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,120
for persistence download and execute web

256
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,320
shell weaver's share and lcd marvel

257
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,640
through meter printers cnc server

258
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,440
the vector is a jsp file the attacker

259
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,720
sends the base64 encoded command to the

260
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,200
web share using the using the exterior

261
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,399
parameter

262
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,200
the execution result is output to a web

263
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,120
page by the println function

264
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,440
create the default account as a member

265
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,000
of the administrators group as you

266
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,360
already know the account named default

267
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,839
does not originally exist on windows

268
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,600
then create markers and tools with

269
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,120
administrative principles

270
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,160
the tools identified were pulse scanner

271
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,920
putty and sql according to

272
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,160
the first mirror installed is

273
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,639
driverdriver.cfg

274
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,399
this module was identified as appleseed

275
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,680
after that download the cassie blah blah

276
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,040
dot cassie file below

277
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,279
the downloaded cassie blah blah blah

278
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,160
cassie downloads the code through socket

279
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,440
communication and executes to eat in

280
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
memory

281
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,320
the marvel finally accurate was

282
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,760
identified as a metasploit interpreter

283
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,000
that makes a reverse connection

284
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,600
next step seventh the article transfer

285
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,720
the compressed files that contain

286
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,480
various source code and research data

287
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,279
in the controller server to on external

288
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,240
exchange server using ftp protocol

289
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,440
next

290
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,720
eighth step additional pr pitching to

291
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,079
insider using webmail information

292
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,519
appreciate

293
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,000
actual accounts obtained through

294
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,240
phishing attack were

295
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,600
used to carry out further attacks

296
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,760
targeting internal researchers and

297
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,839
engineers

298
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,440
to increase the trust of the receiver

299
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,240
the email account representing the

300
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,560
internal information secret team among

301
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,760
the student account was obvious for the

302
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,880
attack

303
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,160
it was disguised as an attachment

304
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,120
related to the contents of the antivirus

305
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,160
update

306
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,360
by obviously the security notice during

307
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,440
the instant response

308
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,320
masquerading as we see vection right

309
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,800
version of data installation file the

310
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,360
installation screen is displayed when

311
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,320
running

312
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,800
but the decompressed model is therefore

313
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,320
deleted replicated and registered as a

314
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,160
service and execution in the background

315
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,560
next correlation on unleashes using

316
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,000
object value of apple c

317
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,040
as we saw earlier we looked at various

318
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,320
summarial samples in operation newton

319
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,199
among them we found a bug in the

320
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,079
processing of analyzing the cnc

321
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,040
communication method of the opposite

322
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,079
vector

323
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,560
it is impossible to know whether this

324
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,639
bug is the code

325
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,800
that the gimski group intentionally

326
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,399
implemented

327
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,279
but it can trigger the code from the

328
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,839
outside so comment injection and

329
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,800
arbitrarily common execution are

330
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,000
possible using this bug we were possible

331
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,720
to continue tracking the episode

332
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,440
sensitive server operating with the same

333
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,360
code

334
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,560
in the case of victory it was a string

335
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,720
used as a password

336
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,000
for web share and ftp authentication in

337
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,360
the past

338
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,600
and the same string was found in the

339
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,199
apple feed server side quote

340
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,680
it's an example of command execution

341
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,720
result using command injection

342
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,680
as our result of continuously tracking

343
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,399
and monitoring the server using object

344
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,680
fail

345
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,199
we hunted the efficient app targeting

346
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,839
android mobile device user from in the

347
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,519
wild

348
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,399
alias name of kimski group is also known

349
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,959
as taiyo

350
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,600
in the apple sheet code of the kimski

351
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,480
group we found that the string thaiyou

352
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,759
representing their threat group name was

353
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,320
used in the code

354
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,639
maybe they wanted to be called by

355
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,199
italian thailand string used in

356
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,839
server-side code to communicate with

357
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,399
appear seed for android

358
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,279
also there are cases where the string

359
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,639
tile is used as a parameter that can

360
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,199
trigger command injection as described

361
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,800
although

362
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,759
as a result of comparing the opacity and

363
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,480
recently used the apple sheet the code

364
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,279
related with command injection which can

365
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,120
be called the existing bug or patchy

366
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,399
and four factors

367
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:53,199
e-f-g-h other than abcd have been added

368
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,880
finally it's on conclusion

369
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,279
kim's key group is a thread group that

370
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,519
has been actively conducting cyber

371
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,640
threat attack from the past cyber

372
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,079
terrorism of

373
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,280
khmp to recently various research

374
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,959
institute

375
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,520
through the operation newton case we

376
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,160
looked at the butterfly effect case of

377
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,880
the attack by the gimski group

378
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,039
which is started with a simple account

379
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,720
takeover piecing

380
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,359
that many people can easily overlook or

381
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,799
take light

382
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,440
or link attached to a simple piecing

383
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,559
email trigger of vulnerability

384
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,280
and it was our case of performing return

385
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,480
movement to on internal server

386
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,120
origin sensitivity information in the

387
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,360
email

388
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,840
the incident response and analyze the

389
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,120
related public data like austin were

390
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,559
combined to provide a clue to tracking

391
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,000
the threat group

392
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,960
of course since data is used after the

393
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,000
incident

394
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,960
there are clearly limitations in taking

395
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,919
preemptive response

396
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,280
however as a result of trying various

397
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,480
methods to overcome this limitation the

398
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,840
bug in application communication was

399
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,799
found

400
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,320
and based on this bug we are able to

401
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,000
actively track

402
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,960
the gimski group after or since the

403
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,679
threat group therefore poems

404
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,360
the attack is also human there are cases

405
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,400
where mistakes are made in operation or

406
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,120
development as in the

407
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,760
example described above

408
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,320
for the threat hunter who tracks and

409
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,600
analyzes it is worth paying attention to

410
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,039
this mistake

411
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,280
because it becomes a clue or a point to

412
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,640
take a preemptive response

413
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,120
through the combination of ttp

414
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,400
identification

415
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,880
using alternate metrics and active

416
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,840
tracking method for attackers

417
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,120
the completeness and maturity of threat

418
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,440
intelligence can be increased

419
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,160
and i think it will have to take

420
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
preemptive response

421
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,039
i hope that the sharing of this research

422
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,400
result will also be helpful to many

423
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,039
people who are information security

424
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,520
community

425
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,320
thank you for listening
