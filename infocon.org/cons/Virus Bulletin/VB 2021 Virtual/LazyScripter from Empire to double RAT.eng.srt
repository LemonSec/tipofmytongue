00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,760
late december 2020

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,560
before starting my talk about lazy

malwarebytes

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,920
at malwarebytes i'm mostly responsible

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,719
to track nation estate and cybercrime

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,680

in blogs and security conferences

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,039
as part of my apt tracking activities i

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,360
perform threat hunting and malware

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,480
reverse engineering too

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,559
in this talk i'm providing a detailed

21
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,359
analysis about the act about the lazy

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,960
scripted actor

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,520
at first i talk about how we identify

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,640
the actor and then talk about the actor

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,600
targets and spam structure

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,560
then i presented set used by the actor

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,280
as well as the ttp and then talk about

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,759
the attribution of this actor at the end

29
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,159
i finish my presentation by providing

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,960
the conclusion

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,080
i have found some interesting malicious

32
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,280
document on late december 2020 as part

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,000
of my daily threat hunting activities

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,240
these documents were designed to target

35
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,240
jobseekers and had embedded objects they

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,040
embedded the embedded objects

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,000
were obfuscated batch files that were

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,880
used to deploy two open source rats

39
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,280
quadric and octopus

40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,079
in some cases i observed that the actor

41
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,200
deployed

42
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,759
deployed some commercial rats such as

43
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,520
rms and or kosarat in addition to

44
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,159
quadric and octopus

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,960
this cut my interest and i've started to

46
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,520
look for similar activities what i

47
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,000
mostly looked for was similar documents

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,360
similar themes similar c2 infrastructure

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,040
and similar hosting infrastructures

50
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,120
my investigation led to uncovering

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,920
multiple activity associated to this

52
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,280
actor and i was able to track back its

53
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,440
activity to 2018 in which the actor used

54
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,920
used similar pattern to target people

55
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,959
looking to immigrate to canada

56
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,120
on that campaign the actor has used a

57
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,440
non-immigration company called canada

58
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,000
visa as lure to enter it weak team to

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,280
execute its loader

60
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,560
since that time i actively monitored all

61
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,760
the activities associated to this apt

62
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,560
and i was able to spot all of the

63
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,200
campaigns associated to this actor

64
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,519
throughout 2021

65
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,840
the latest campaign operated by this

66
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,959
actor

67
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,680
was late june this year that the actor

68
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,760
has targeted aviation industry

69
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,120
in this section i'm going to talk a

70
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,360
little bit about the targets of this

71
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,000
actor

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,480
the actor has mainly operated spam

73
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,040
campaigns in low volumes to target its

74
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,440
victims the actor has used several

75
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,159
different teams in its campaigns

76
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,959
the used teams can give us a rough idea

77
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,200
about who exactly where the target of

78
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,480
the actor

79
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,959
the main target of the actor is is

80
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,599
aviation industry in which the actor

81
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,560
used several teams including inter

82
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,840
international air transport association

83
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,599
related teams such as iata security iata

84
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,879
patches

85
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,560
and iata updates to target its victims

86
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,080
the actor also used application names

87
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,319
associated to aviation industries such

88
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,319
as iata1id

89
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,920
and bsblink to lure its victims

90
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,519
iata1 id is a new concept inter

91
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,720
introduced by iata for contactless

92
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,280
identity manage management that

93
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,759
leverages by biometric technology

94
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,358
technology

95
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,600
and bs billing is the global interface

96
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,440
for travel agents and airlines to access

97
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,840
the aita billing and settlement plan

98
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,199
beside targeting iata the actor has used

99
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,680
several other teams to target other

100
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,080
industries at as well

101
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,560
as an example we have observed that the

102
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,000
actor has used unwto

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,199
as a team to target tourism industry

104
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,440
in some cases the actor has used some

105
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,160
more generic teams such as microsoft

106
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,400
update or koi19

107
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,960
to target almost everyone around the

108
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,000
world

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,800
in co-igniting team the actor has is

110
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,360
proved who email addresses to target the

111
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,800
victims

112
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,759
also we have observed that the actor has

113
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,720
used teams to target people that are

114
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,759
looking for jobs

115
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,360
another interest interest of the actor

116
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,440
is the people that are trying to

117
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,600
immigrate to canada through federal

118
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,919
skill worker programs or provincial

119
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,120
programs

120
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,280
we observe that the actor has used

121
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,759
government of canada forms as decoy

122
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,960
documents

123
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,440
as an example in one of the most recent

124
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,479
cases the actor has used job application

125
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,120
associated to detail quebec

126
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,759
as lure detailed quebec is the sectorial

127
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,400
workforce committee in the retail trade

128
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,199
that works with the retail businesses

129
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,120
throughout the quebec province of canada

130
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
in this section i'll talk about

131
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,280
different spam models used by the actor

132
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,880
to distribute its loader

133
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,240
in all the svm campaigns the actor has

134
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,280
distributed its custom loader we call

135
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,919
cocktabus this loader is usual is

136
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,039
usually

137
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,600
embedded in zip file or at malicious

138
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,919
document

139
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,120
there we identified three different type

140
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,319
of spam used by this actor in the first

141
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,880
type the actor has embedded its

142
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,240
cocktails loader in an archive file or

143
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,840
in an office document and send the email

144
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,199
send that as a send them as an email

145
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,039
attachment

146
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,280
in the second type the actor sends

147
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,720
benign pdf file as a spam attachment the

148
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,400
pdf file contains a url that redirect

149
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,919
the victim to download cooktopus loader

150
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,880
as an example as you can see

151
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,199
on the bottom of the slide

152
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,720
the at hp pdf file is pretending to be a

153
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,360
document from iata and providing the

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,639
iata and providing the user a link to

155
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,520
download an update for bsp link software

156
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,479
this is a clever way used by this actor

157
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,880
to avoid being flagged by a spam

158
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,520
filtering system that are able to block

159
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,880
suspicious attachment

160
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,720
in type 3 the actor only has embedded a

161
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,120
link in the body of the email that

162
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,280
redirect the victim to download

163
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,800
cooktopus loader the actor usually uses

164
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,800
url shortener services to hide its real

165
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,440
addresses

166
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,240
the following diagram shows the timeline

167
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,120
of the activities associated to this

168
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,479
actor

169
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,879
as you can see the actor started its

170
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,160
activities on in 2018 by targeting

171
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,960
people that want to immigrate to canada

172
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,199
using canada with allure and then

173
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,479
continued its activities throughout 2020

174
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,360
in which similar to many other actors

175
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,400
it took advantage of code 19 as team to

176
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,479
target victims

177
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,879
the last two campaign operated by this

178
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,080
actor

179
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,240
were april

180
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,440
around april may and june 2021 that the

181
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,560
actor has used bsp link and iata as lure

182
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,080
as lures to target victims

183
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,160
in this section i'm going to talk about

184
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,880
the toolset and ttps used by this actor

185
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,279
this diagram shows the overall process

186
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,080
activities operated by this actor as i

187
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,000
mentioned before

188
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,120
attacks usually start by spam email that

189
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,760
contain either a zip file or malicious

190
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,880
document the document or zip file

191
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,760
contains a variant of loader we called

192
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,920
cocktapus that performed there that

193
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,440
performed the rest of malicious

194
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,320
activities this loader starts its its

195
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,519
activities

196
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,240
by bypassing uac and then deploying

197
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,120
quadic and octopuser ad

198
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,600
in some cases based on the collected

199
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,800
information

200
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,600
it deploys a commercial right or like

201
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,680
rms cosr ng rat or mcos rat in the next

202
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,560
set of slides i'll provide the more

203
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,800
detailed information about this process

204
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,600
the main toolset used by the actor is a

205
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,560
loader we call cocktapus in this section

206
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,560
in this section i present the deep

207
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,760
analysis of this loader

208
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,680
we have identified four different

209
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,959
variants of this loader batch executable

210
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,279
vbscript and registry

211
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,800
i'll start

212
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,279
from the batch variant of this loader

213
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,600
usually batch variant of this loader is

214
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,480
highly obfuscated using batch encryption

215
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,040
tool batch encryption is an advanced

216
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,120
batch obfuscation tool

217
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,399
that uses a combination of noun and

218
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,800
custom environment variable encoding

219
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,839
techniques to obfuscate a batch file

220
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,000
after the obfuscation we can follow the

221
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,399
process of this loader

222
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,600
it starts its activities by checking the

223
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,640
os version to execute the right uac

224
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,720
bypass technique

225
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,440
if the os version is 10 it uses fad

226
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,480
helper

227
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,839
for uac bypass otherwise it uses event

228
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,800
viewer to bypass uac

229
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,440
in fact the actor is trying to execute

230
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,920
its malicious activity with highest

231
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,399
privilege and for that it performed one

232
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,839
of these two well-known uac bypasses to

233
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,480
gain the admin privilege

234
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,440
after the gaining the right privilege it

235
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,320
tries to disable the disable all the

236
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,720
registry keys and schedule tasks

237
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,360
associated to microsoft defender

238
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,959
here is a small snippet of this process

239
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,640
as you can see

240
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,040
it tries to disable real-time protection

241
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,480
behavior protection and anti-aspire

242
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,120
protection

243
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,000
after finishing the privilege escalation

244
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,720
and bypassing the security products it

245
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,120
starts its activity to deploy its rats

246
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,800
for this paper for this purpose it uses

247
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,200
powershell to download another batch

248
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,000
file which again is obfuscated using

249
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
batch encryption tool

250
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,680
this downloaded batch file is

251
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,120
responsible to download and deploy to

252
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,399
open source rad quadric and octopus

253
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,320
at first it persists them using

254
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,560
autostart registry key

255
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,440
and then add them to a schedule task to

256
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,160
be executed in regular time intervals

257
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,399
the name of created a schedule task

258
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,279
usually are something to pretend

259
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,399
it's related to windows update chrome or

260
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,560
mozilla updates as an example we observe

261
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,120
a scheduled task name like windows

262
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,360
update automatic chrome updater and

263
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,399
automatic module

264
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,560
the created schedule task deploys an

265
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,839
octopus agent as a as a script this

266
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,639
agent first collects the victim info

267
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,680
including host name username os version

268
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,279
os architecture

269
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,279
process id

270
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,399
network domain and then builds an http

271
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,240
request based on the collected

272
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,079
information

273
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,920
and then aes encrypt and base64 encodes

274
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,480
the request and finally sends the

275
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,440
request to c2 server as an authorization

276
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,000
http field header

277
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,120
the key and iv for aes encryption is

278
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,120
hardcoded within the agent code

279
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,639
after initializing the connection with

280
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,839
the server it co it goes into a loop to

281
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,399
receive commands from the server

282
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,920
the commands are base64 encoded and aes

283
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,560
encrypted and need to be decoded and

284
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,320
decrypted first

285
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,120
octopus agents support four commands the

286
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,120
first command is false

287
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,240
if the command is false false the agent

288
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,360
does nothing and waits on the loop the

289
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,600
second command is report

290
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
if the receive command is report the

291
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,959
agent collects in victims info including

292
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,440
list of all the running processes

293
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,720
local ip address os version last put

294
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,760
time

295
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,560
os locale and current time and then

296
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,399
encrypt and encrypt and base64 them and

297
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,399
send sends them

298
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,199
in a authorization http file to the

299
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,600
server

300
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,519
the third command is download if the

301
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,160
receive command is download the agent

302
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,040
upload the content of the specified file

303
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,880
to the server the final command is reset

304
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,600
pc it seems this comment has been

305
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,760
designed to reset victim's machine but

306
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,160
in this case it seems this feature is

307
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,000
still has not been implemented

308
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,199
after deploying octopus it deploys

309
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,160
quadic by calling mshta as you can see

310
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,360
from the above image

311
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,760
the actor has used ms hda and run dll32

312
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,399
for quadric stagers

313
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,880
these eight stagers downloads f download

314
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,079
first quadratic stage is back

315
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,120
the first stage quadratic factor through

316
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,160
using js javascript

317
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,199
this first stage is obfuscated and after

318
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,519
the obfuscation we can see that it's

319
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,639
responsible to collect victim in victims

320
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,399
information

321
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,199
the collected information are as follow

322
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,440
it execute the hua mai command slash all

323
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,199
to get this se debug privilege it gets

324
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,480
os version and build by reading all

325
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,720
relative relative registry locations it

326
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,600
gets group policy histories by reading

327
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,079
their registered locations

328
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,959
it gets process architecture and then

329
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,480
gets a collect list of list directories

330
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,720
in the temp folder

331
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,680
also it collects the content of ip

332
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,480
routing table by executing wrote print

333
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,519
command

334
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,160
and then also it gets computer name

335
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,120
username and with windows code page at

336
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,000
the end it builds an http request with

337
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,519
this information

338
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,759
and send to send them to command and

339
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,639
control server

340
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,440
the quad stager

341
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,279
also used to download additional

342
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,000
payloads such as corsar engineer at

343
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,399
ramcos and rms all the additional

344
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,440
payloads that deployed by this actor

345
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,600
were commercial rats

346
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,160
in some cases the cocktabus loader

347
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,720
deploys some other open source tools

348
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,079
such as adspactor

349
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,880
another variant of cooktopus loader that

350
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,480
we observed is executable variant

351
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,639
we analyze executable variants and

352
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,279
notice that all the executable variants

353
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,680
in fact are the batch variants of the

354
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,720
loader

355
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,600
that have been converted into executable

356
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,680
using back to exit

357
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,880
tool

358
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,120
the actor has used several different

359
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,639
icons for its executable variants to

360
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,079
pretend they are legitimate application

361
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,199
uh we observed that the actor used iata

362
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,720
or iata one id icon also in one of the

363
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
most recent campaign the actor used

364
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,000
google authenticator as its executable

365
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,880
variant r icon to pretend to be that

366
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,519
application

367
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,240
coctopus has also has also two other

368
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,400
variants vbscript and registry key

369
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,439
variant

370
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,240
the vba script variant has the same

371
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,079
functionality as we mentioned in the

372
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,599
batch variant

373
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,280
with the different that process

374
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,000
execution has been started by a vbs

375
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,039
script that calls ws script to execute a

376
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,199
powershell command

377
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,199
the registry key variant sets the

378
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,520
autorun registry key with a powershell

379
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,480
command that download and execute a

380
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,080
batch variant of cooktopus

381
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,679
the actor uses dynamic dns providers for

382
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,000
command and control communication as

383
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,280
well as hosting its payloads dynamic dns

384
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,080
pro i providers allow people to create

385
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,080
free subdomains

386
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,720
on shared domains and as you can see the

387
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,600
actor has created several subdomains on

388
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,640
different dynamic dns domains for its

389
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,520
command and control communications

390
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,600
we also observed that the actor used

391
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,039
github and discord to host its payloads

392
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,000
the actor switches its hosting service

393
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,640
from github and discord

394
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,280
to dynamic dns servers after we

395
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,760
published our first report on their

396
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,400
activities

397
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,160
in this section i'm going to talk about

398
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,000
a little bit about the attribution of

399
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,480
this actor

400
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,960
usually in attribution process several

401
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,440
factors are being considered such as

402
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,840
ttps and toolset

403
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,400
decoy documents and victims from this

404
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,799
point of view we found some similarity

405
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,960
between this actor with muddy water apt

406
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,240
as an example both have used quadric and

407
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,039
empire in their previous campaigns both

408
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,440
have used scripting languages such as

409
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,799
powershell

410
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,520
and javascript in their campaigns both

411
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,559
have used

412
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,600
github to host their malicious payloads

413
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,640
and both have added some fork of some

414
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,000
popular tools to add some legitimacy to

415
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,919
their github accounts

416
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,720
also both have used a scheduled task and

417
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,520
registry run keys and also a startup

418
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,880
folder for

419
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,840
persistency

420
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,880
but from the analysis of analysis of

421
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,200
infrastructure used by the actor we

422
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,760
found some interesting artifacts about

423
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,960
the origin of the actor the actor

424
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,360
used a gmail account for most of its

425
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,600
activities and also

426
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
uses a nickname

427
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,640
patch 10 in different services we were

428
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,720
able to track back

429
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,880
the real ip of the actor

430
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,240
and the

431
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,520
ip addresses are located in morocco

432
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,919
also we were able to find some social

433
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,360
media accounts

434
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,200
related to this

435
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,240
actor and those accounts suggest that

436
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,000
the actor is from yemen

437
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,400
based on our new findings we believe

438
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,880
that this actor is not related to muddy

439
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,360
water apt and it's a new group

440
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,080
originally originated from yemen and

441
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,240
possibly have some team members in

442
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,960
morocco as well

443
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,520
in this presentation i provided an

444
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,000
overview of new actor we called lazy

445
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,960
scripter the actor has operated

446
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,919
spam campaigns in low volumes to target

447
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,039
its victim

448
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,880
the main target of the actor are

449
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,039
aviation industry and people that are

450
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,280
trying to immigrate to canada through

451
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,840
job programs

452
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,640
the main toolset used by actor is a

453
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,799
loader we named coctopus that has been

454
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,720
used to deploy quadric and octopus rat

455
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,400
this loader has

456
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,120
four different variants batch executable

457
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,480
vbscript and registry key

458
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,679
also we found that the actor is mainly

459
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,840
reliable to open source and commercial

460
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,360
rats for its malicious activities

461
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,080
in overall i can say the actor is not

462
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,360
very

463
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,919
sophisticated actor and does not have

464
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,240
advanced capabilities such as developing

465
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,919
custom tool sets

466
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,720
but still it's an active actor and keep

467
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,120
using commercial and open source tools

468
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,360
and keep operating spam campaigns

469
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,919
yeah that's end of my presentation

470
