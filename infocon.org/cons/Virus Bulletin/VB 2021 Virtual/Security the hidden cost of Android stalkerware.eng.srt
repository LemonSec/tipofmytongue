2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,800
if you thought that social media knows

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,360
everything about you you were right

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,239
however today i will tell you that there

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,960
are apps that know even more would you

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,560
like to know more

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,880
have you ever been feeling like spied

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,359
upon have you ever encountered the

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,680
strange behavior of your smartphone have

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,240
you ever had a feeling that you know

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,320
that somebody knows but you don't know

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,840
how they know

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,559
they might know because they installed

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,760
stalker software in your smartphone

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,800
so what is stalker wear

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,680
simply put it's a spying app it is

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,840
installed into smartphone with physical

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,160
access of the stalker so we need to know

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,800
your pin unlock a smartphone and site

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,680
load the application then allow all the

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,399
necessary permissions and based on these

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,879
permissions we can tell what are the

23
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,000
capabilities of the software afterwards

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,640
stalker is hidden from the victim's view

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,280
and it can impersonate legitimately

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,200
looking applications such as settings

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,880
where these apps could be downloaded

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,400
from besides shady websites apparently

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,560
they were available even on google play

30
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,080
store imposing as kit or employee

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,200
supplies

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,080
resulting in fact that it wasn't that

33
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,040
difficult to install them whatsoever

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,799
precisely they were installed over

35
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,040
140 000 times from google play store

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,479
alone

37
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,079
so the number speaks for itself

38
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,399
based on our data from our android

39
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,399
client devices as you can see in the

40
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,159
slides now these apps have become more

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,640
and more popular the last couple of

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,520
years

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,759
in 2019 we detected five times more

44
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,399
installs as in the previous year last

45
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,360
year

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,640
the texture increased up to 48 percent

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,680
we see that popularity is still on the

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,840
rise

49
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,440
so

50
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,400
how can we make sure no one is looking

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,640
over our shoulder this problem has been

52
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,959
discussed and luckily for us

53
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,239
it has been so how either by manually or

54
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,720
dynamically using trustworthy security

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,360
software that detects

56
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,480
informs and removes our uninvited guests

57
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,519
however

58
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,800
its enormous popularity made us wonder

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,800
and worry about one more problem

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,879
who else might be watching

61
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,760
since stylecover gathers more private

62
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,239
data about their victims than any other

63
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,920
app you have installed in your

64
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,480
smartphone right now and i'm talking

65
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,959
about the privacy and security of

66
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,120
victims information that might be at

67
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,959
risk since such software can access

68
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,599
almost all the sensitive user data

69
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,480
when we picked one of the most popular

70
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,360
social media application and compare its

71
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,200
permission to stalkerwear it is

72
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,560
important that

73
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,400
social media app request these

74
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,800
permissions only when necessary so when

75
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,560
a user wants to take a picture there is

76
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,200
a request give us a permission one time

77
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,319
during using the application or forever

78
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,080
contrary stalker where in order to work

79
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,120
properly all the permissions needs to be

80
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,040
checked as a result stalker has full

81
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,000
access

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,640
all the time

83
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,920
let's take a look

84
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,680
the phone on the right belongs to the

85
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,799
attacker

86
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,959
the attacker is not a stalker

87
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,440
it's a person that misuses security

88
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,599
problems found in stalker where

89
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,239
the victim and the stalker are not aware

90
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,200
of the attacker or his actions

91
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,319
the phone on the left belongs to victim

92
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,040
the attacker sends text message to the

93
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,400
victim

94
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,080
the victim receives text message

95
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,879
stalkerware would process it and it

96
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,599
would trigger a phone call

97
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,280
back to the attacker

98
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,000
instantly opening a microphone spying

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,160
opportunities without victims knowledge

100
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,440
or any authentication

101
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,800
please pay attention to upcoming slides

102
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,759
where we will deep dive and

103
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,639
share with you our research

104
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,880
where we'll focus on a stalker security

105
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,199
and we'll close all that with

106
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,759
responsible disclosure to affected

107
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,160
vendors

108
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,800
now the question is where from we gather

109
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,639
style cover apps

110
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,120
um from various sources starting with

111
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,680
them as telecom indicators of compromise

112
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,160
which is available on github then from

113
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,960
our malware database where we picked the

114
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,919
most populars being used in the world

115
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,360
last year

116
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,479
google

117
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,120
advertisement paid pr articles top

118
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,080
google search because of that we gather

119
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,680
information about 86 stall cover vendors

120
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,360
that are represented by 86 different

121
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,240
stalkerware apps

122
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,479
mobile style cover covers two main

123
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,120
platforms we focused only on android

124
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,440
well the reason is simple

125
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,000
the market share and the easiness of

126
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,320
site loading the apps in android

127
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,440
comparing to ios device needs to be

128
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,639
jailbroken or stalker needs to have

129
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,759
icloud credentials and there is one more

130
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,080
reason

131
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,880
for all analyze the vendors

132
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,759
or

133
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,320
all analyze the vendors provide android

134
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,600
solution but only 37 of them provides

135
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,840
android and ios as well

136
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,840
we end up again with analyzing 86

137
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,880
different apps provided by 86 different

138
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,440
vendors what we did we went through

139
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,319
manual static and dynamic analysis to

140
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,520
observe

141
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,759
its behavior and capabilities

142
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,720
we would like to state a fact that this

143
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,960
was not a full penetration test we

144
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,639
focused on privacy security issues but

145
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,840
actual impact on their clients victims

146
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,319
company however the matter is really

147
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,720
serious

148
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,720
there are some limitations i would like

149
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,560
to go through them first

150
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,520
because we haven't paid for any of these

151
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,639
software we didn't want to support them

152
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,720
we were limited by the provided

153
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,120
functionality of the application and the

154
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,280
full accessibility of the admin panel

155
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,120
which is responsible for sending

156
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,680
commands to to the app receiving data

157
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,280
storing them etc

158
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,840
still we were able to test to fully test

159
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,639
dynamically and statically 72 apps out

160
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,160
of 86

161
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,280
and

162
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,400
14 were limited to static analysis only

163
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,720
what were our findings again for these

164
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,520
86 apps we found security issues with

165
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,039
serious impact in 67 percent of them

166
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,520
33 percent were without serious security

167
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,160
or privacy issue discovered by us all

168
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,840
together we identified 158

169
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,840
security exploitable problems in 58 apps

170
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,198
represented by 67

171
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,800
now we'll jump into particular problems

172
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,560
still even because the limitations we

173
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,759
discovered 158 security problems

174
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,879
such as a data leak on the network on

175
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,160
the device on the server possibility to

176
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,720
frame data tempered with data being

177
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,680
uploaded to the server remotely

178
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,720
controlled device by text message

179
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,120
possibility take over account remote

180
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,360
code executions possibility to live

181
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,840
stream from smartphone

182
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,199
i prepared two more video demonstrations

183
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,879
where i will explain some of the

184
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,639
vulnerabilities now i will go through

185
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,560
some of the most serious ones

186
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,520
starting with http leak where

187
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,160
many style covers 22 of them

188
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,680
use

189
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,559
um

190
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,279
not encrypted

191
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,760
protocol http to transfer sensitive

192
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,880
information

193
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,958
including credentials

194
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,919
during either registration by stalker or

195
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,800
logging in into the panel

196
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,880
as a result the attacker on the same

197
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,600
network could steal these credentials

198
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,120
and excess

199
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,600
stalker's admin panel to control a

200
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
victim's smartphone without knowledge of

201
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,959
the victim

202
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,320
and stalker mainly

203
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,000
besides credentials

204
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,920
some of the stalker apps could also

205
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,080
download additional modules binary

206
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,600
modules or updates of themselves again

207
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,160
over http and there was no integrity

208
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,480
check again attacker on the same network

209
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,160
using man in the middle could replace

210
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,880
the binaries and trigger remote code

211
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,720
execution on the smartphone

212
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,640
the most common issue issue was a leak

213
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
of

214
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,720
gathered information from smartphone of

215
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,600
the victims such as contacts text

216
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,200
messages

217
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,279
photos videos

218
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,440
audio recordings

219
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,720
etc

220
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,440
from the leak leak on the network let's

221
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,240
move to the leak on the smartphone

222
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,200
of personally identifiable information

223
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,360
what does it mean

224
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,839
all the gathered information were stored

225
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,200
on external media by stalkerware

226
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,640
and

227
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,200
third-party apps installed on a device

228
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,040
could with a proper permission and read

229
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,600
write external storage access these

230
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,800
files

231
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,760
and because that that they could access

232
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,920
files that otherwise would not be

233
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,600
accessible with a proper permission such

234
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,480
as video recordings and

235
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,040
screenshots etc

236
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,440
in one case stalkerware

237
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,399
stored admin token

238
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,519
in a text file on external media and if

239
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,440
any other application would store that

240
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,399
it would it could access the stalker

241
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,560
account to control a victim's smartphone

242
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,959
some of them provided

243
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,360
key logger functionality meaning they

244
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,320
could lock all user input in a text file

245
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,839
that was stored on external media

246
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,079
these key logs were not anyhow protected

247
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,240
and accessible to apps installed on a

248
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,640
smartphone and because of that other

249
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,440
apps could actually take over not just

250
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,360
account of the stalker

251
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,160
but also other apps since the restored

252
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,640
password emails login credentials

253
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,800
the most frequently seen device leak was

254
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,320
unprotected storing of extracted data

255
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,560
such as recording phone calls taken

256
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,120
photos screenshots in some cases even

257
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,480
calendar events

258
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,959
browsing history contact list phone

259
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,959
number received text messages

260
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,720
so from a league on the network league

261
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,480
on a smartphone on the device let's move

262
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,640
to the leak on the server

263
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,680
user data leaks through open directories

264
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,560
there were available data such as

265
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,240
victims photos

266
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,079
recorded phone calls

267
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,760
details about them such as names

268
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,480
physical addresses text messages social

269
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,360
media messages email addresses these

270
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,920
data were accessible without any

271
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,560
authentication authentication for anyone

272
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,440
during analysis we discovered and tested

273
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,839
that manipulating with victims data

274
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,279
wasn't a problem at all many apps used

275
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,760
for pairing the device and the server

276
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,639
account unique device id such as either

277
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,360
email number or android id instead of

278
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,000
using server generated token

279
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,959
however these device ids

280
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,000
are easily obtainable by other apps on

281
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,160
the smartphone

282
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,839
there are two case scenarios how this

283
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,480
could be misused the first one

284
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,279
if data are uploaded over http again

285
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,440
attacker using mana metal could replace

286
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,360
the data to frame a person for two data

287
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,800
and makes a life of the victim a little

288
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,959
bit more difficult

289
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,320
second one

290
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,040
third-party apps could easily obtain

291
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,519
email number android id which are the

292
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,079
unique ids

293
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,079
that are paired with a smartphone

294
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,120
because of that these apps could upload

295
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,240
custom

296
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,160
data tempered data to server to frame

297
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,079
other person

298
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,240
custom text messages

299
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,639
phone calls video recordings pictures

300
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,200
etc

301
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,360
in the case of no internet connection

302
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,680
some of the stalkers were provided

303
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,360
ability to receive sms commands however

304
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,800
not all of them verify if the commands

305
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,120
are received from a stalker and because

306
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,240
of that anyone could remotely control

307
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,920
victim's device by text message

308
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,079
there are two things necessary the first

309
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,160
one is a phone number of the victim this

310
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,240
could be either extracted by third party

311
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,360
apps or is already known to the attacker

312
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,320
the second are sms commands and these

313
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,279
sms commands are available on the

314
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,199
vendors websites already

315
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,320
i prepared one quick demonstration again

316
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,000
the phone on the right belongs to the

317
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,320
attacker the attacker stays on the

318
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,519
stalker the phone on the left belongs to

319
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,000
a victim the attacker send text message

320
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,920
to victim

321
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,399
the victim receives text message

322
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,839
um

323
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,480
the text message would trigger a sharing

324
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,680
exact gps location back to the attacker

325
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,519
back to anyone who sent the text message

326
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,839
of course gps needs to be enabled on the

327
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,959
victim's smartphone

328
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,920
ability to start arbitrary components of

329
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,440
a stalker where

330
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,639
because of

331
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,199
unprotected export components in android

332
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,440
manifest it is possible to trigger

333
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,880
restricted only stalker functionality as

334
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,279
a result any application installed on

335
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,079
the smartphone could through stalkerware

336
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,920
without proper permission

337
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,519
take photos pictures record calls we

338
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,079
called record surrounding audio take

339
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,920
screenshots wipe data enable disable gps

340
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,360
reboot smartphone etc

341
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,320
and afterwards these data are accessible

342
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,399
since they are stored on external media

343
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,399
what happens when a spying ends

344
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,680
this

345
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,800
this is a photo taken by a stalker of my

346
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,839
ceiling

347
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,160
while it was live it was lying next to

348
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,959
me

349
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,000
unfortunately it is still stored and

350
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,560
accessible on their server even though

351
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
the stalker in this case me

352
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,040
removes data logs on the link's

353
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,519
smartphone and removes full account

354
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,079
besides photos taken by the stalker all

355
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,720
the servers are still accessible my text

356
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,199
messages and my content full contact

357
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,240
list

358
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,680
in other cases of stalker where data are

359
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,279
not removed immediately when requested

360
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,279
but rather it takes

361
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,600
90 extra days to be deleted for some

362
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,000
reason

363
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,199
hard-coded secrets in uh

364
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,480
actual apps this is not about a token or

365
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,120
a password as you might expect

366
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,360
rather just server links

367
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,639
that are responsible for triggering a

368
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,839
live stream for a smartphone

369
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,000
what is it all about

370
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,440
in app are hardcoded links that could

371
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,199
through server

372
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,040
things that could through server trigger

373
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,360
live stream for a particular device with

374
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,399
a provided id the only things that is

375
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,240
necessary is this id

376
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,000
however this id is stored on external

377
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,560
shared media which is accessible to

378
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,240
other apps with proper permission and

379
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,839
re-divide storage

380
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,600
let me show you a quick video

381
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,240
demonstration

382
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,399
how this could be misused

383
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,120
so

384
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,599
we have victim smartphone on the left

385
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,599
side where stalkerware is already

386
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,919
installed and then we have three windows

387
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,119
the first one

388
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,480
is our notepad it contains three links

389
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,240
that were hard coded

390
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,559
the second one is our browser

391
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,599
and the third one is vlc where from we

392
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,599
will watch the live stream we copy the

393
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,039
first link we see that stream is not

394
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,839
available then we make two requests to

395
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,080
server and if it returns true

396
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,039
server will

397
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,360
enable live stream from the particular

398
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,679
device the id was provided

399
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,120
and allows to anyone watch the stream

400
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,719
and listen the audio from a device

401
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,200
these were the serious issues discovered

402
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,080
by us in the style cover apps

403
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,320
now i would like to continue an actual

404
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,840
report to these issues

405
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,240
we follow 90-day disclosure practice

406
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,960
by up to three vendor contacts

407
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,679
we contacted them through email or

408
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,000
through support ticket if we haven't

409
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,320
heard back we went through the same

410
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
scenario making the email and contacted

411
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,799
a ticket one more time

412
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,200
in two cases we were not successful

413
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,080
contacting the vendor the reason was the

414
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,400
email address was full

415
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,880
and the ticket creating a support ticket

416
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,320
through their website always returned a

417
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,879
some error

418
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,840
so what are the results so what are the

419
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,799
results of reporting the issues

420
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,679
so from 58 apps that have the problems

421
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,919
10 of the vendors

422
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,120
fixed the issue within 90 days

423
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,799
12

424
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,039
promised issues will be fixed but they

425
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,080
are not

426
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,720
and 78 of the

427
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,200
apps with the problems did not respond

428
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,200
to us nor fixed the issues

429
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,400
because of that

430
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,559
we decided not to publish the full list

431
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,039
where we connect security problems with

432
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,320
actual apps or vendors

433
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,000
we are heading to conclusion

434
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,840
but before that

435
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,160
let's quickly go through a compromise

436
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,960
scenario and couple of prevention tips

437
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,679
so hope stalker can install stall cover

438
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,760
in a victim smartphone he needs to have

439
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,000
physical access this cannot be done

440
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,919
remotely scenes

441
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,200
stalker first needs to set up account it

442
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,440
means either create account or login

443
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,200
for doing that he needs to unlock a

444
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,440
smartphone so he needs to have a pin

445
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,360
and site load to the application and

446
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,760
then clear clean all the

447
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,400
traces that's it it takes up to two

448
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,720
minutes

449
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,520
a couple quick prevention tips make sure

450
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,760
to have enabled lock screen protection

451
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,080
either use pin or password

452
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,799
in the case you believe someone already

453
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,039
knows your pin code and might access

454
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,440
your device change the lock screen

455
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,280
protection and

456
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,400
possibly

457
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,840
use

458
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,039
security solution that will detect the

459
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,120
style cover in your device and inform

460
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,840
you about that

461
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,080
some compromise signs if you don't have

462
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,919
any solution and you don't want to

463
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,120
install that

464
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,080
the battery drains much faster there's

465
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,640
higher internet consumption since it's

466
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,520
communicating non-stop with the admin

467
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,720
panel

468
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,320
suddenly gps wi-fi or mobile data are

469
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,400
enabled disabled by itself as it appears

470
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,880
and there's a suspicious uh persistent

471
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,600
notification in notification bar

472
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,720
photos video recordings audio recordings

473
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,360
and screenshots are being done and

474
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,840
stored in your smartphone as it appears

475
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,960
by itself

476
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
not taken by you

477
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,600
and there are questionable received text

478
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,000
messages which are most likely commands

479
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,960
since not all the stalker were to clean

480
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,159
these text messages

481
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,960
we're heading to summary and as you saw

482
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,520
a number of used style cover apps has

483
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,280
been increasing based on our data

484
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,520
they gather and store more private data

485
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,440
about their victims than any other apps

486
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,360
you have installed in your smartphone

487
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,720
right now

488
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,559
many of them have security issues that

489
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,000
were discovered by us in 158

490
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,280
applications

491
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,600
problem is that the vendors are not

492
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,960
willing to fix them since 78 of them

493
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,440
haven't respawned back and not fixed

494
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,799
them

495
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,520
we would like to appeal to anyone who

496
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,159
might be thinking of using such software

497
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,120
to reconsider that using stalkerware to

498
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,840
spy on your spouses it's not just

499
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,360
unethical but it also reveals private

500
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,919
and intimate information about them but

501
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,720
also about those who installed it and

502
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,720
want to spy on their close ones

503
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,080
thank you very much for your attention

504
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,840
enjoy more talks to come

505
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,630
