2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,960
hello we are born and researched from

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,440
chihuahuan here this is my colleague

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,599
tulane ming today we will share our

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,920
research findings psychic history night

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,119
we observed in the past year

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,199
the whole presentation consists of five

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,720
parts let me start sharing first

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,080
background

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,080
kextec first caught our attention in

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,800
january 2021 when our btmon system

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,840
detects a large-scale scanning using 1d

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,000
and nd vulnerabilities

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,399
they attack target announced device and

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,800
cloud server in a short period our

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,520
honeypot capture exploit scan from

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,320
hundreds of different source ips

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,480
at the same time we found the sudden of

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,559
reserve record for the download server

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,440
domain from partner institution we

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,280
quickly stream the sample from the

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,559
attack payload

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,359
and pre performed in deep analysis its

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,359
attack mainly contains two malaysian

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,559
samples

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,600
one example ring mining the other is it

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,880
is the death family necro aka free guard

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,880
developed with peasant his passions

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,200
recruit fail and the installer packed

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,880
out files

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,439
so script fail and elf use the same set

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,479
of code

33
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,720
through the code version information we

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,439
found that the developer is free

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,680
and the first version was developed in

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,640
2015.

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,880
through the version information in necro

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,040
we found the paste being accounted in

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,759
the kickstack and shared many code steps

40
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,000
we analyzed all the code under the paste

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,799
bin

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,119
the mellitus code involves auto8

43
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,439
javascript python

44
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,320
bash c and other languages convert

45
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,360
windows and linux platform as well as

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,159
exploit tag against the variant of cloud

47
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,520
server and iot device among them there

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,560
are near

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,119
every version of necro and the world

50
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,560
cancer net

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,560
there is a high degree of similarity in

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,399
their code structure

53
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,800
a lot of version information is written

54
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,239
in this code

55
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,560
we can see that freak has joined or

56
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,879
found multiple organizations and used

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,440
multiple nicknames

58
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,879
for example

59
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,160
he founded ochoan salamander squad

60
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,879
before 2014.

61
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,080
since 2016 he has used multiple code

62
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,959
name

63
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,280
hobless control says max sedura nonsec

64
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,879
melanco and

65
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,200
kickstack 2020

66
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,440
we found the record of using these

67
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,280
nicknames to pedal malware on hm forum

68
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,840
and this software appeared in sample set

69
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,640
with later cut

70
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,480
we found a group of

71
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,959
gravity variants on netcross download

72
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:53,920
server

73
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,319
the file name starts with a cakesec and

74
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,480
a kickstack related string appeared in

75
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,280
the sample at the same time we found

76
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,760
developer named freak anonymous on

77
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,640
github he claims to be the developer of

78
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,159
records and is responsible for related

79
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,200
attack

80
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,480
the shared code extremely code used by

81
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,599
necro in summary will be reside freak is

82
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,440
co-developer of kx organization

83
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,440
in order to understand the background of

84
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,280
kickstack we have collected more

85
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,159
information on relative social platform

86
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,680
most of which have been suspended

87
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,560
there is only one account le underlying

88
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,400
kickstart created in 2016 on twitter

89
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,640
which has been very active in recent

90
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,959
years however the organization only

91
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,360
carried out high profile type on

92
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,560
billboard

93
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,200
and did not exclude any other type of

94
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,519
hiking activities

95
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,080
not it excludes any information about

96
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,360
its members

97
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,319
it used to be famous to hiking billboard

98
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,480
and then post map fee tweets

99
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,040
which were later reposted by mark v

100
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,959
himself

101
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,959
there are reports that examination

102
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,799
hacked key

103
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,000
known vpn server and leaked certain

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,640
vacation information subsequently the

105
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,600
organization started on twitter that

106
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,680
it has nothing to do with them and

107
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,240
another person launched the tech through

108
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,800
the analysis of historical twitter

109
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,440
no record of ddos hacking activities in

110
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,919
the organization can be found

111
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,560
this is completely unrelated freaks long

112
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,520
years of detect activities so we can't

113
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,479
associate this kickstart with freaks

114
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,880
kickstack

115
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,360
charging from the sixth information

116
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,680
we are unable to list the detailed

117
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,320
organization members of kickstack but it

118
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,199
does not affect our tracking analysis of

119
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,240
organisation hiking activities

120
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,680
we start out

121
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,800
kick sex attacks activities from august

122
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,880
2020 to present

123
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,919
and analyze samples and exploits

124
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,919
first we summarize the corresponding

125
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,240
general rules by analyzing the haunted

126
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,600
symbols

127
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,560
and scan back the sample database

128
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,800
to find the heat samples

129
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,520
then regroup them by clustering and

130
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,600
remove the false positive samples that

131
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,639
clearly did not belong to ksec

132
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,199
leaving about 5000 samples we use this

133
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,160
as seed to extend sample sets through

134
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,080
our own threat intelligence mining

135
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,440
system

136
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,320
correlating queries on capture time

137
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,479
exploit and some other relevant

138
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,360
attribution

139
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,520
finally we got the targets

140
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,520
that need to be analyzed in the past

141
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,039
year we captured a total of 23 exploits

142
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,360
5564 samples and three malware family

143
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,120
ignore invariant classification

144
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,560
use this data as base to come through

145
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,120
kickstack's historical activity

146
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,520
we have generated the following chart we

147
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,880
can see that

148
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,759
kex launched a scan at the attack on

149
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,039
target cross network almost non-stop

150
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,680
our honeypot see new variants and

151
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,080
exploit all the time each time some

152
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,639
occasionally breaks with the newer

153
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,440
export is introduced the scan increased

154
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,199
significantly

155
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,280
the year-long attack campaigns can be

156
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,759
divided in two fees as shown high

157
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,560
frequency attacks are maintained until

158
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,800
december 2020

159
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,160
and they resumed in january 2021 well

160
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,240
kxx started spreading the brand new

161
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,520
malware family negro

162
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,479
kickstart launched two types of scanning

163
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,599
attacks while using identical standing

164
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,919
server under the other using simple

165
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,639
building scanning capabilities

166
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,039
we do not distinguish between these two

167
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,280
scanning methods and only focused on

168
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,960
scanning payload information for

169
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,639
statistics

170
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,199
we encounter the new exploit and payload

171
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,360
propagating malware families in

172
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
chronological order

173
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,840
comparing the new captured export time

174
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,039
points and the pure excursion time i

175
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,639
can't be seen that

176
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,319
kex utilitation of one day is very fast

177
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,479
especially after the start of necro

178
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,000
propagation

179
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,720
the attack activity can often be seen

180
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,360
within a few days of poc exposure

181
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,120
kickstack has developed multiple

182
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,520
malicious program family across windows

183
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,199
and linux system

184
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,319
involving pcs servers multiple iot

185
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,120
platforms and created the complex botnet

186
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,400
platform

187
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,080
here is a detailed analysis

188
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,720
kickstart activity maintains remain

189
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,840
family gapchi tsunami and the necro with

190
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,720
new features constantly added

191
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,120
except for necro whose framework is

192
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,080
developed by kickstack kex inherits

193
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,440
other families from open source code

194
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,080
our analysis shows that textiles have

195
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,160
extraordinarily strong ability for code

196
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,479
management using open source or link

197
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,400
code or develop different rounds

198
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,000
extensively

199
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,639
which lead to a nearly variant chaos for

200
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,240
example

201
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
freak the key member of kickstack

202
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,080
developed and open sourced the two

203
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,639
tsunami events

204
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,199
capsaicins and ziggy redo however we

205
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,120
found some tsunami samples that makes

206
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,958
code from both

207
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,479
capsaicin at the ziki the sample sorted

208
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,120
or chaos and exists and captivates

209
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,839
include loose loose boats oreo big bo4t

210
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,120
and the sims

211
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,320
some variants even reuse dynamic code

212
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,560
as for necro the purely peasant

213
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,279
developed family not only reused as

214
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,600
protocols due to communication but also

215
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,839
based on many key features from open

216
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,279
source project

217
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,600
due to that complication we do not

218
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,680
follow the naming of the kickstart to

219
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,440
classify the variants

220
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,839
but break down the samples into three

221
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,200
main families

222
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,760
of gravity tsunami and necro to

223
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,720
summarize an unless the technic point

224
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,480
and the design ideas this year

225
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,080
the scanner used by kx is meaning

226
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,800
exploit undertalenet under csh weak

227
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,600
password scan the open source version of

228
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,920
tsunami telnet scan use a function

229
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,800
called

230
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,160
burn the juice

231
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,040
in the capture samples we found selling

232
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,839
kexack used a function called ak-47

233
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,080
telescope

234
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,320
the two set of code algorithms

235
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,800
are almost identical only the standard

236
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,360
output section are different

237
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,519
the sample first detect if the device

238
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,160
supports raw socket and if it does it

239
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,920
use miranda health scan code if not ek

240
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,480
47 tells gun will be used

241
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,800
in fact

242
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,959
ak47 telescan function is also from

243
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,880
public available source

244
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,519
not original from kickstack the relevant

245
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,720
code is as follows

246
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,880
the ssh scan is done by necro family

247
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,120
bone knight necro first try to install

248
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,560
the parameter

249
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,800
library on the device and they will

250
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,480
succeed and added port 22 to the list of

251
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,320
scan ports

252
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,640
and refused to do so it just give up a

253
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,519
six scan after receiving the scanning

254
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,720
command the building scanner start

255
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,440
ss6 scan weak password are constantly

256
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,760
updates by version upgrade

257
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,160
and new weak password are added to

258
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,600
replace some

259
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,959
less effective ones

260
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,920
our samples contains exploit scan in

261
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,200
tsunami and gravity like floyd can

262
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,360
placed in ak-47 scan and showing above

263
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,600
there are scanning code for huawei and

264
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,040
the real-time

265
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,240
devices

266
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,399
according to our observation on an

267
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,000
analysis

268
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,800
cache organization organization does not

269
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,519
have the zero-day resource so most of

270
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,480
the plc codes are public available

271
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,920
if the poc is implemented in c it can be

272
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,160
integrated in these two families with

273
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,240
simple modification

274
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,959
if the plc code is implemented in person

275
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,040
it can be integrated into the necro

276
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,839
family with some individual rent the

277
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,760
exploit can go up to thousands

278
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,440
the three more popular exports

279
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,079
integrated by negro can be seen in the

280
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,839
image valve

281
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,480
under the original purity of this code

282
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,680
can be found online

283
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,519
packet sniffing is one of more favorite

284
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,160
features of kexac and the code can be

285
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,560
seen in all three families

286
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,959
the basic function is to capture tcp

287
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,440
traffic after felting out some specific

288
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,160
port ips 100 to remain data to the c2

289
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,200
this is saving code used in tsunami and

290
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,680
gravity you can see that the same set of

291
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,479
code is used

292
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
the following figure is the savings

293
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,360
network code used by necro

294
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,839
the code for function can also be found

295
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,519
on hub

296
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,720
we can see that the data is reported in

297
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,399
the same port

298
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,760
1337 and since necro also used as a

299
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,000
protocol we can see that necro can share

300
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,639
the same c2 as tsunami

301
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,800
although we did not analyze the daggers

302
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,839
in tips here it's easy to see that kxl

303
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,000
want to build the boneless based on the

304
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,760
rc protocol

305
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,240
that can affect our architecture and

306
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,760
operating system

307
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,360
and can be unified management

308
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,200
change password name this is a very

309
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,680
traditional technique on this system

310
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,839
mainly by using random string to

311
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,760
override rcb parameters and the pctl

312
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
syscall to change the process name and

313
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,560
start the parameters to disguise

314
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,240
the precise using rootkit height process

315
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,440
the open source project r77 rocket is

316
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,480
used

317
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,440
directly on windows season

318
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,600
it's a ring three layer

319
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,920
locations that intercept and filter

320
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,480
information about target process by

321
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,600
globing

322
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,200
hooking some

323
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,800
function of ntdl

324
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,639
necro first downloads

325
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,040
the corresponding version of the rocket

326
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,160
file which is dynamically loaded and run

327
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,040
directly in memory by process injection

328
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,519
necro used precise injection to load the

329
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,920
stroke by wiping the file into the shell

330
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,959
code

331
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,040
other than injecting the whole shell

332
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,839
code into the process memory the loading

333
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,720
of the rotate is done by the shellcode

334
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,120
which come from an open source project

335
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,399
on github

336
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,800
named rdr

337
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,720
necro used dji to evade the c2

338
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,600
interception its historical version

339
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,480
the relevant algorithm is as follow

340
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,040
the first algorithm is the purely random

341
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,720
algorithm that picks 16 characters at a

342
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,839
random

343
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,320
from a customer alphabet to generate a

344
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,720
c2 domain name

345
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,519
with the top level domain xyz

346
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,000
because the seed of the random algorithm

347
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,639
is fixed the random number generated has

348
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,800
a stable result

349
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,320
dd and s

350
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,959
plus random this second algorithm is

351
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,199
based on dds service and the random

352
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,360
algorithm is pickup

353
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,639
10 to 19 characters randomly from the

354
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,600
customer alphabet this manner is cheaper

355
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,639
and more flexible

356
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,199
we found a tall proxy being used in

357
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,519
communication in situ in both gravity

358
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,440
and necro

359
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,000
top proxy is used in talk to c2 up to

360
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,720
173 prox fps can be used for a single

361
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,000
sample

362
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,440
a communication is established by random

363
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,680
selecting one from the list of the

364
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,600
candidate process

365
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,519
and in this case

366
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,760
a connection to online c2 will be

367
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,000
followed

368
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,639
necro also use tall proxy to reach

369
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,680
online co2 and the rc protocol is used

370
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,120
for c2 communication

371
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,800
most of gravity and stability symbols we

372
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,199
captured are not packed and have no

373
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,720
strip symbolic information and a few of

374
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,519
them packed sample use the standard ups

375
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,079
gel which can be removed directly with

376
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,600
open source tool

377
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,680
as an impact sample are also not

378
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,000
stripped

379
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,920
obfuscated gravity and tsunami sample

380
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,240
encrypted sensitive in strings such as

381
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,320
c2 address with a simple mapping

382
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,519
algorithm and that decrypt them with a

383
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,199
decode function using strings

384
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,160
this augustine also developed by cask is

385
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,959
used by a tsunami version called ziki

386
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,759
star stash in the nearly variant the

387
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,800
code table was identical to the one in

388
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,360
the original zika star code

389
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,040
after several integration the code table

390
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,639
was changing to this one

391
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,320
negro also crept to graphically protect

392
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,880
the stream by first performing character

393
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,560
substitution

394
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,479
then doing zip compression

395
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,240
necro used passive source called the

396
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,320
observation technology

397
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,320
technique exposed in 2015 called

398
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,600
polymorphic engine by kickstack

399
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,920
and this algorithm is constantly

400
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,199
improved during macro upgrade so far we

401
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,199
have observed two versions of

402
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,959
polymorphic engine

403
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,839
the old version uses a random string to

404
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,799
replace a predefined list of key object

405
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,119
names

406
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,000
the new version just passes on ask the

407
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,720
library to dynamically traverse and

408
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,599
replace the global objects with random

409
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,720
string

410
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,880
as we can see there is no need to

411
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,280
manually filter the object name and the

412
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,599
string can be automatically traversed

413
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,480
and encrypted

414
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,679
kickstacks malware mainly use the

415
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,720
gravity and ice protocol to send

416
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,919
commands the protocol is mainly used by

417
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,480
the gupta variant and interestingly the

418
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,080
command in the sample are encrypted

419
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,080
after receiving the instruction the

420
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,240
local instruction table need to be

421
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,679
decrypted before pass

422
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,039
the rc protocol is the most widely used

423
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,280
product in kx

424
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,480
and it's supported by the tsunami necro

425
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,120
and the dike as in families

426
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,600
this means that only one c2 system needs

427
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,679
to be developed and maintained to

428
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,720
control our family

429
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,280
kickstag attacks the target device

430
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,679
mainly through exploit so the network

431
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,039
widely

432
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,080
vulnerability scan is its mean

433
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,559
of spread malicious samples

434
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,720
well the room lag propagation through

435
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,640
the infection demands is also an

436
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,280
important function of the malware

437
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,039
in addition to this

438
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,559
there are some

439
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,400
horizontal spread measures

440
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
infection page

441
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,320
we found in necro that it can infect web

442
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,120
on the target device after receiving the

443
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,679
infection command it insert a gs code

444
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,600
into the file

445
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
campaign point yes

446
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,919
it is highly opportunicated code after

447
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,520
decoding it is the javascript file

448
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,840
based on trojan

449
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,919
cloud9

450
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,320
asmb scan necro added smb scan code in a

451
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,480
certain version to achieve the function

452
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,720
of historical propagation in the

453
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,480
intranet

454
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,480
perhaps actual effect was not

455
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,360
satisfactory and it was removed in

456
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,280
subsequent version

457
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,160
the code can also be found in github

458
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,400
kickstack not only enrich the

459
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,679
functionality with a lot of reference to

460
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,320
third-party code but also deliver the

461
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,559
completely open source project directly

462
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,880
to the target device to finish the

463
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,039
corresponding functionality

464
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,600
easy cloud9 which allowed kickstart to

465
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,760
use the friction browser to dynamically

466
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,480
load malicious code and launch a ddos

467
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,760
attack

468
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,400
what surprised us with cloud9 is also

469
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,039
belong to mr freak he discovered a fake

470
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,360
firefox plugin on the downloaded server

471
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,559
and found this resource that plugin is

472
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,200
also injecting cloud9 malicious code in

473
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,720
browser

474
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,520
it is not clear through what channel is

475
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,039
plugin is propagated

476
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,600
kickstack also contains the popular

477
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,000
mining function which is not deeply

478
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,080
integrated in both but directly

479
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,840
implementing by developing a third part

480
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,320
mining program most of the samples are

481
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,520
after manual coins occasionally we see

482
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,120
some other coins such as xtd coins

483
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,280
checking the relevant wallet address we

484
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,080
found that the returns are not ideal

485
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,880
through the above technical analysis

486
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
point we can summarize the

487
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,760
characteristics of the relevant families

488
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,640
into the following table we can see that

489
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,120
necro has the most comprehensive

490
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,799
function and features

491
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,960
but kickstack is still maintaining under

492
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,280
development tsunami gravity

493
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,000
we suspect that necro relied on passive

494
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,240
random environment and some low power

495
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,280
device

496
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,840
do not support the person in order to

497
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,960
cover more platform both both master

498
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,760
have to operate in more multi-families

499
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,720
of bonnet at the same time

500
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,880
next the mechanical thinking who

501
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,159
will share the left part

502
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,320
hi guys i'm alex turin i will bring you

503
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,799
a brief introduction to the kickstarts

504
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,760
operations based on the capture samples

505
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,240
with respectively some statistic

506
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,880
analysis on their operations the

507
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,559
relative conclusions are as follows

508
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,200
first let's talk about the nikola family

509
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,080
we use the samples on march 11th at the

510
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,480
basic version and describe several

511
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,360
subsequent versions with obvious

512
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,760
functional and logic changes

513
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
in the malicious code the author use a

514
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,799
string as a mutex to achieve certain

515
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,520
executions different mutants can

516
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,679
correspond to different major version

517
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,559
updates of the necklace so we use the

518
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,360
mutant strain as a motion mark which

519
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,679
will simply divide the necklace update

520
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,159
during this period into three stages

521
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,840
stage one

522
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,039
outbreak

523
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,320
the mutant strain is again neglect at

524
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,679
this stage

525
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,159
the nectar use dga and

526
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,080
onion to double kill linux and the

527
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,640
windows profile plot file

528
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,799
and during this period they also

529
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,159
frequently

530
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,640
use multiple online and offline

531
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,600
vulnerabilities to take the effect

532
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,760
stage 2 development

533
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,159
the muted stream is international civil

534
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,520
warfare at this stage the author give up

535
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,000
djs turned into a large number of

536
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,200
proxies to access the annual network and

537
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,559
improve the botnet's functionalities and

538
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,480
stability

539
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,960
stage three stable

540
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,760
the mute touch screen is kind of gid

541
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,120
stream since this version was updated on

542
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,000
may 28 we have not seen more frequent

543
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,559
activities but you can see that the

544
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,520
corresponding c2 is stable and

545
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
active

546
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
how about necklace related to

547
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,039
information

548
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,880
these three pictures

549
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,840
are statistic of the excess trend of the

550
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,880
next historic c2 and the download server

551
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,120
from the picture we can clearly see the

552
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,200
lifecycle of different domain names

553
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,400
during the

554
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,080
next update process we estimate for

555
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,640
several c2 domains which are currently

556
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,280
active in necklace the number of daily

557
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,520
requests should be stable at more than

558
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,240
10 thousand

559
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,520
now let's take attention to the tsunami

560
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,960
and get you to family we counted the

561
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,520
number of new samples captured today

562
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,760
starting from last august to make this

563
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,279
figures

564
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,279
we can see that there's a

565
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,440
significant increase in the number of

566
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,480
samples over the last year this is not

567
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,080
simply a repeated propagation of the

568
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,760
same samples as the code is adjusted

569
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,159
almost on a daily basis

570
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,720
some several upgraded samples can be

571
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,919
captured in one day this indicates that

572
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,679
the kickstart group

573
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,440
has sufficient manpower resources and is

574
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,440
becoming increasingly active

575
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,159
how about tsunami and the gas g62

576
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,520
information we collect the x86 and the

577
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,400
x64 samples from

578
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,559
tsunami and gafjet

579
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,120
is extracted legacy to information and

580
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,600
accounted layer c to activity historic

581
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,080
by correlating the domain names resolved

582
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,760
record of c to rp's in 2020 through our

583
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,360
passing passive dns system we can go two

584
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,640
key domains named the gx branch.net and

585
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,159
the cnc blahblah.xyz

586
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,480
has assumed in the left of the figures

587
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,360
most of ips have connections with

588
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,159
these two domain names

589
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,080
from

590
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,600
2021 onward

591
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,679
kickstart drops the use of these two

592
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,640
domains and turn it to dga and the rna

593
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,840
network

594
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,799
using

595
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,520
the graphic information provided by our

596
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,919
graph system we find a clear pattern of

597
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,320
activities in its existence hcc to ips

598
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,760
survive cycle various from one month to

599
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,880
three months

600
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,279
the preference is to use ap resources in

601
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,000
the same network segments within the

602
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,520
same cycle the deployment of c2s use

603
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,799
domain names and ips until this march

604
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,080
and then shifted to using top process

605
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,080
from match onwards

606
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,880
after tool is introduced the honestly

607
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,640
two domains get up

608
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,279
get updated at a very high frequency for

609
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,559
example there are 10 iron domains used

610
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,440
in much alone

611
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,559
necklace death street and tsunami which

612
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,360
family is kickstack's favorite

613
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,679
we found some kind of patterns in

614
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,400
tracking delivering the samples

615
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,760
the tsunami appeared in last mid august

616
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,080
and was active for a short period of

617
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,520
time

618
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,400
jet was active intermittently from

619
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,039
september to december

620
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,080
a a malicious family named nakarov

621
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,720
suddenly appeared in this january from

622
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,039
earlier to the middle february first

623
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,080
tsunami resumed the propagation land

624
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,760
deficit land followed by the jeffers

625
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,799
tool

626
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,080
there are many similarities between the

627
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,240
gifted two balance and the

628
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,320
previous capital captured guptidus

629
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,960
samples from the code level

630
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,400
they are clearly

631
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,919
homogenous

632
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,159
each family is constantly switching

633
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,799
between development and the propagation

634
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,000
cycles

635
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,799
in the development cycle a large range

636
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:07,600
of

637
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
improvements would be made

638
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,480
this kind of change as you distribute

639
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,520
approach is used to continuously improve

640
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,640
the botnet's bottomless functionalities

641
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,640
which resulting a large number of

642
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,279
different samples be distributed in a

643
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,240
short period of time

644
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,240
okay finally we get here come to the

645
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
last conclusions

646
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,320
there may be several hacker groups with

647
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,440
the same name text we are trying flicks

648
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,880
kickstack

649
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,399
we can see

650
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,000
the scans and attacks across the network

651
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,520
launched by techstack almost never stop

652
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,720
although it has no zero-day exported

653
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,799
discovery capabilities

654
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,440
its strong code integration and botnet

655
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,640
operations make it a destructive hiking

656
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,520
group

657
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,000
and the speed of one day exploratory

658
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,720
utilization shows that it could be a

659
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,679
very organized productive and aggressive

660
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:06,559
group

661
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,880
ksec is trying to make profit from

662
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,919
doodles monies the incentive information

663
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,679
and selling members

664
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,440
through this long term

665
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,640
trichome we can see that ddos attacking

666
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,360
is

667
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,640
is the most active one which may be

668
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,840
the biggest

669
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,399
source of revenue of the

670
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,440
group

671
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,760
however kickstart has not given up on

672
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,480
other means and has kept expanding into

673
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,960
new directions we will keep our eye on

674
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,120
it

675
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,240
that's all thank you for listening

676
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,520
[Music]

677
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,600
you
