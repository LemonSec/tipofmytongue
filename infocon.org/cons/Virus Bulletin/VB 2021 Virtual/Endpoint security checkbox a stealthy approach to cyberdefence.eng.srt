00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,320
hi everyone

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,719
i'm nathaniel adewale i'm a trait

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:13,920
researcher

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,440
in my previous role i helped

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,240
various organizations across different

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,480
sectors to secure that data

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,240
asset

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,920
i will be presenting on the topic that

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,160
says endpoint security is steady

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,840
approved to cyber defense

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,600
the research methodology i used was

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,800
basically practical review of

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,879
endpoint security solution

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,120
across spherostock

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,079
and also i also review related work 15

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,200
total from 2000 from year 2000

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,000
to july 2021

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,760
and lastly i also do i carry out with

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,800
sophie

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,520
from i targeted practitioners actually

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,600
put in security

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,079
and the objective of this

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,720
presentation

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,320
first objective is to practically

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,240
challenge to review the challenges of

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,080
endpoint security based on the theory

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,159
pillars of security the people the

29
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,200
process

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,880
and the technology

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,400
and i

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,960
this presentation will also outline the

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,720
expectation

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,799
that is to maintain balance between

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,119
security and productivity

36
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,920
and lastly to guide it standard a guide

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,960
to

38
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,280
a policy maker

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,439
decision implementer

40
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,079
and also stakeholders across various

41
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,920
sectors

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,880
as to know the minimum yeah stick

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,680
to

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,520
for a better endpoint security when they

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,040
are choosing a

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,079
endpoint security

47
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,479
a statistic uh

48
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,040
was taken by signing uh

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,840
previously and this statistics

50
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,320
shows that student

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,280
and tutors faculty members they actually

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,000
engage in youtube videos and massive

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,040
online

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,399
resource

55
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,959
internet added they spend more time on

56
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,840
application socializers use social

57
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,000
medias and there are some presenters

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,280
like me that uh they write blogs the

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,640
right technical content they push

60
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,800
content out there they are businessman

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,040
that they track stocks

62
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
uh traveling and news related to

63
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,160
e-commerce

64
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,480
and they are giving us so one thing that

65
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,360
is peculiar one thing that is

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,840
similar to one thing that is a plain

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,480
truth is almost everyone

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,160
will fall into one of these categories

69
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,760
i guess almost everyone will fall into

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,440
one of this category

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,840
so one thing is

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,440
most of these user most of these

73
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,360
categories they all speaks to the end

74
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,319
point

75
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,160
everybody use the end point either

76
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,000
you're a gamer either you are a

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,480
presenter just speak to the end point so

78
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,800
what was the idea of the end point

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,879
the idea of the end point initially is

80
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,360
that is the workstation on the pc

81
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,840
but nowadays it does transfer it has

82
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,800
transpired into

83
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,319
iot with the era of iot we have servers

84
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,560
we have uh internet of things smart

85
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,319
devices we have smart gadgets love

86
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,599
mobile phones

87
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,040
and nowadays now a url in an api or an

88
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,440
ec2 instance you span and instantly your

89
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,879
cloud workload

90
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,879
is tian endpoint

91
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,560
uh which interacts with the server

92
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,720
resources so endpoint is fast paced all

93
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,599
around almost everything is endpoints

94
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,319
so

95
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,480
why endpoints

96
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,159
so based on the statistics we've shown

97
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,040
here status relating to bridges starting

98
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,200
releasing to the cost of the bridge

99
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,840
global cost of egypt bridge per

100
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,879
strategies relating to how bridge are

101
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,480
detected

102
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,519
and who actually confirm that an attack

103
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,400
or

104
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
an organization has been breached

105
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,680
is it the third party uh is it uh blue

106
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,480
teams is it the attacker itself

107
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,280
uh the the sample the

108
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,439
of new strains of malware per day

109
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,799
globally

110
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,760
uh as it is shown on the screen is five

111
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,280
sixty thousand

112
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,439
five sixty thousand per day according to

113
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,519
data approach

114
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,000
also ibm also shows that it takes 128

115
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,880
days to actually dictate a threat

116
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,040
to actually dictate

117
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,520
a bridge and 80 days on an outfit to

118
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,600
actually contain it so another thing

119
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,040
that we why another reason why we are

120
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,360
focusing on the end point is

121
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,479
uh most of these bridge most of these

122
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,639
attack can be categorized most of these

123
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,479
devices most of these

124
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,880
internet users can be categorized

125
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,000
broadly under that is host based either

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,960
it is application based so our mobile

127
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,199
mobile app web app

128
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,440
everything is either based on the server

129
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,919
either web server

130
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,400
database hosts based

131
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,160
so and everything is pointing to the

132
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,479
endpoint so endpoint is very important

133
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,759
endpoint is very important that's why

134
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,919
we're studying endpoint security

135
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:08,880
so

136
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,880
a big a brief history over time um it

137
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,639
all started with creeper one by bob

138
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,440
thomas uh he was trying to

139
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,600
experiment and he wrote is a very benign

140
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,680
program that we just display i'm a

141
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,160
creeper catch me if you can't

142
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,639
the elk clone now also follow suits they

143
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,800
are very benign and it's

144
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,160
the intent is is not to actually

145
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,520
leak an effort

146
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,280
the intent is

147
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,440
just either to play pranks practical

148
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,360
pranks on friend or private experimental

149
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,800
research then later it's moved to

150
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,759
jerusalem uh it's moved to a more uh

151
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,000
humpful attack which is jerusalem

152
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,960
murrays and the likes so notable among

153
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,400
them is uh melissa and this how we send

154
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,000
an email

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,880
an email a an email

156
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,440
a meditation we send an email and once

157
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,160
you open it it is it will hijack your

158
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,840
server and you now spam

159
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,039
and send

160
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,680
50 emails to replicate itself you just

161
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,680
spread 50 ml to

162
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,039
each of your connection each of your

163
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,960
contact list so it's becoming more

164
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,919
benign

165
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,560
it's becoming more harmful then towards

166
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,160
the 12th 2011 today we have

167
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,080
the era of various apts and various more

168
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,120
sophisticated malicious attack extremely

169
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,199
malicious attack that's where that's

170
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,360
when we have uh ryuk ransomware we have

171
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,479
one now cry we have mirai botnets very

172
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,280
very rapid around

173
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,960
2090 2020

174
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,440
we are fleeing uh we have crypto lockers

175
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,280
and and failed um failures order and

176
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,680
somewhere in attacks

177
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,759
then attacks one thing about most of

178
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,160
these attacks that the attacks are smart

179
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,759
i focus on their attacks now not their

180
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,840
attack it says so by the attacks i may

181
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,639
put

182
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,120
malware and boots attack the attack

183
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,599
factor the attack part so

184
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,919
when you analyze most of this attack

185
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,960
when you try to analyze then you

186
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,120
discover there are some efficient

187
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,639
mechanisms that are actually put in

188
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,080
place we suggest that they're actually

189
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,280
very smart

190
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,680
uh we have parker code we have uh

191
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,759
polymorphy code

192
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,080
most of this is to bypass the detection

193
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,800
algorithm the underlying detection logic

194
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,720
now the the concept they are good

195
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,440
algorithm for most of these

196
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,199
most of the malware is is very simple if

197
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,919
there are indicators that suggest that

198
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,479
i'm in the sandbox our analyzer i mean

199
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,919
analyzing environment suspend actions

200
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,479
pretend exist kill processes

201
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,400
if there is no indicator like that to

202
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,360
suggest that then execute my malicious

203
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,400
payload

204
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,160
i just got this

205
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,319
i just have this as so

206
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,240
signature bypass

207
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,840
those are the method that several

208
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,160
methods are automated to bypass the

209
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,400
signature dictation algorithm

210
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,440
uh

211
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,240
also for the behavioral analytics there

212
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,800
are methods to bypass the sandbox

213
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
analysis which are logic bomb logics

214
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,120
must speak to the fact that

215
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,240
a malware is crafted to execute at a

216
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,960
specified later date and time

217
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,680
our stalling code as as i've indicated

218
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,599
the stolen code we

219
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,440
load the

220
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,080
we first execute a normal issue a

221
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,440
relevance

222
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,400
code

223
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,200
to delay to actually escape that

224
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,240
analysis period then later before you

225
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,958
now started executing the malicious code

226
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,559
itself

227
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,599
uh extended sleep extended sleep speaks

228
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,800
to

229
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,760
senses sleep speaks to

230
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,160
you actually the malware actually

231
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,480
pretending

232
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,880
not executing itself probably it might

233
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,440
sleep for like he did my sleep for

234
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,279
several hours before it actually now a

235
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,279
second now user interactions

236
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,200
speaks to the fact that

237
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,000
uh malware tends to check for

238
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,720
mouse click my way tends to check for

239
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,440
last access file my way test to check

240
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,240
for

241
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,200
the host configuration system so system

242
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,839
properties like

243
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,600
username uh is that is that sample in

244
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,000
the box or is that my way sample you say

245
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,680
to scan

246
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,760
most of this can be achieved with this

247
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,000
window utilities we make you can list

248
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,160
the

249
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,480
you can list the user you can use the

250
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,000
host properties

251
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,440
you can list

252
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,880
the

253
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,120
mac address you can list

254
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,320
several properties that are related

255
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,279
who's the printer num the printer name

256
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,120
the name that you used to name the if

257
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,800
there is something related to vm or

258
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,360
virtual technology so among one one of

259
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,480
the most uh notable malware samples is

260
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,120
carbon and black squid uh those malware

261
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,360
are very steady in the first in the

262
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,959
sense that they they actually

263
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,480
scanned the environment they have

264
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,160
environmental awareness property

265
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,760
mechanism to actually dictate that i'm

266
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,360
actually in the sandbox

267
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,000
uh going further a step further

268
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,920
from from our analysis so far we've

269
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,760
discovered that what has actually

270
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,160
changed is there is an increasing level

271
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,680
of sophistication in this malware sample

272
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,000
so that speaks to the abcd advanced

273
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,920
design advancements

274
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,040
and also there is a in terms of skill

275
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,760
in terms of skill there is an increasing

276
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,600
account in terms of scale and also

277
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,640
their title types started from

278
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,720
a physical program

279
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,399
program the

280
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,200
file program to something to actually

281
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,320
leverage on the integrity of running

282
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,519
processes that you don't have to

283
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,360
actually need to

284
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,279
that run in the memory probably

285
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,160
malicious and powershell script wmi

286
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,880
macros that run in embedded office that

287
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,959
is embedded into office suits

288
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,360
and similar stuff like that uh more than

289
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,079
just straight actors motivations started

290
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:08,880
from

291
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,200
benign motivation of just trying to

292
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,160
experiment or just trying to play pranks

293
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,440
on your friend

294
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,240
to

295
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
something that is more diversity

296
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,720
something that is more dangerous so

297
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,880
also threat according from researchers

298
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,399
i've said to abc group uh

299
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,920
and this these are these are some of the

300
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,880
apt group of our time

301
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,200
so there's also a trend in

302
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,120
anti-malware products as they clean the

303
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,880
atomic products from it all started from

304
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,680
antivirus initially endpoint security

305
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,600
revolve around just antivirus once you

306
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,519
have your antiviral set

307
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,959
uh that that's the end of endpoint

308
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,560
security but over time

309
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,800
cretactor has learned how to bypass most

310
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,880
of these antivirus automatically and

311
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,440
also one thing is antivirus is virus

312
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,639
focus so it's used signature in the

313
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,800
detection engine later it improves our

314
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,639
time to using heuristics like it's

315
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,040
trying to compare the source code of to

316
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,839
create a cluster of uh

317
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,480
a family of malware then later we we

318
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,000
move to epp which is provincial focus it

319
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,480
also has anti-exploit uh properties and

320
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,040
up control but one that is one thing

321
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,880
that is like a baseline to

322
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,000
both of these detection mechanisms they

323
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,560
only dictate known

324
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,399
known signature you only detect known

325
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,600
threats

326
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,839
and no one can feel it from fender it's

327
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,279
possible one friend was detected

328
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,800
designed this vendor has not actually

329
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,200
updated his detection engine or probably

330
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,760
defenders actually updated they knew

331
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,320
about these boats the end user the blue

332
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,920
team are not actually pulling the

333
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,880
updates

334
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
for this signature so that that's

335
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,839
another challenge

336
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,639
um then also later we move to edr

337
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,959
which

338
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,720
focus on the

339
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,600
detection and and also xdr extract try

340
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,839
to combine ideal nta and wider

341
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,600
uh going forward uh this review

342
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
is based on three pillars of attack

343
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,800
which is the people process and

344
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,279
technology okay

345
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,000
so for the endpoints solution technology

346
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,680
these are the products that help to

347
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,440
protect the systems

348
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,800
so one of the first the first

349
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,279
checkpoints is at the deployment stage

350
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,279
sorry deployment stage one of the issues

351
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,480
that

352
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,800
has been encountered over time is

353
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,760
complexity and deployment

354
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,079
so by complexity deployment you are

355
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,279
having issue uh analysts or

356
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,920
security engineer have issues with

357
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,600
compatibility

358
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,399
in deployment with existing tools so i

359
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,279
want to deploy an edr and there is

360
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,600
window defender defaults

361
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,560
on

362
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,279
the

363
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,399
endpoints

364
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,600
and is actually in he's actually in

365
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,199
contrast actually he repeating my

366
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,120
deployment is actually

367
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,720
working against each other so that it's

368
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,360
not affecting system resources or

369
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,279
probably agent is not supported or

370
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,320
probably there's difference in

371
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,680
architecture

372
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,279
the architecture is only support the

373
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,360
only deployment that is available is

374
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,199
probably for mac there's no window

375
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,639
there's no linux or probably it's only

376
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,639
there's it's only all cloud there's no

377
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,160
cloud support

378
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,800
oh the installation requirement also too

379
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,199
is also resource intensive in terms of

380
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,680
complete memory the number of stories

381
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,920
that is required so most of these things

382
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,320
actually post a challenge

383
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
so the next checkbox is use case

384
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,279
implementation uh one beauty about

385
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,240
organization is that different sectors

386
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,959
one sector is

387
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,079
uh the the eighth sector is different

388
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,399
from different tech from ngo from

389
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,480
governments parascatas

390
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,440
so most of them also have so and there

391
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
are different needs for most of these

392
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,639
ngos

393
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,839
another thing is capability and flexible

394
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,160
flexibility of assigning reputations

395
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
so if you want to implement blacklist

396
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,240
based on your use cases

397
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,399
uh is it flexible enough to blacklist ip

398
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,600
blacks by ipo what it is by fire parts

399
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,199
or black list by

400
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,279
other ios

401
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,199
so it should not be very rigid you

402
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,560
should be able to meet up with the

403
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,120
customers customization

404
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,279
uh requirements

405
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,000
so

406
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,320
the api should also be very interactive

407
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,399
and simple excellent documentation

408
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,079
should there should be also there should

409
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,000
be support for this

410
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,160
so the next on my check box is security

411
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,839
activities impart on system resources

412
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,040
often time and say malware products

413
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,480
endpoint solution xdr is there

414
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,399
the tends to

415
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,040
take a normal system resources when they

416
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,880
are trying to scan on when probably

417
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,800
configuration is implemented by an

418
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,920
analyst

419
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,639
or sometimes when you have to query

420
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,160
something that uh when you have to run

421
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
some queries probably don't create one

422
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,040
thing

423
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,959
and this actually affects make the

424
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,720
system to anc

425
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,480
and it's leave

426
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,519
user with endpoints users with only one

427
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,959
choice

428
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,120
and does to disable the

429
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,199
endpoint solutions so most of the time

430
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,519
users like prefer confidence

431
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,759
and sometimes they have to trade

432
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,759
security for their confidence so what's

433
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,399
expected is it should be less

434
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,800
resource intensive should not be taking

435
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,440
much of system resources

436
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,399
then the next checkbox the next checkbox

437
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,519
is a

438
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,839
useful framework should be integrated

439
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,000
into the edr so most of the challenges

440
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,120
we

441
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,240
observe over time is questions

442
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,759
and justification for each of the

443
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,839
mitigation step each of the remediation

444
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,279
has recommended

445
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,560
this

446
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,040
and also there's most of the most of

447
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,000
these solutions emphasize much on the

448
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,639
attack stages sometimes and they don't

449
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,559
give an in-depth overview of the threat

450
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,439
itself so what is expected is the there

451
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,000
should be a simple interpretable model

452
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,679
for analysts so the analysts can

453
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,119
leverage on this in their traditional

454
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,640
logic or in

455
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,720
when they are doing their investigation

456
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,319
to clients or probably when they are

457
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,319
presenting evidence at the court of law

458
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,679
and they can actually leverage and

459
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,679
reference most of this model one of the

460
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,679
uh some of the popular model is the

461
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,400
cyber key chain which is trying to map

462
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,039
each of the stages each of the attacks

463
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,400
to the stages

464
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,280
in the from the foothold from the point

465
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,880
where the attacker gets a photo into the

466
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,320
environment to the point where it's

467
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,559
actually exfiltrate data

468
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,360
so another thing that's similar is a

469
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,720
miter attack framework meta framework on

470
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,280
like my tata framework actually speaks

471
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
to the techniques and the tactics the

472
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,480
procedures

473
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,640
by tactics i mix the white inside the

474
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,400
white and

475
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,200
the techniques and procedures speaks to

476
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,440
how it actually achieved that i actually

477
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,840
achieved the processes so one beauty one

478
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,000
recent uh framework is the unified

479
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,679
kitchen we tried to manage booth to

480
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,280
cyber kitchen and they might attack

481
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,880
together

482
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,200
then another check box is integrated

483
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,799
straight intelligence

484
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,640
so often time

485
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
friend does take too long to release new

486
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,000
updates new signature also there's an

487
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,760
enormous number of malware samples

488
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,000
released that is not in sync with the

489
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,160
solution with this anti-malware product

490
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
this leave the solution the anti-malware

491
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,679
product with two

492
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,720
options

493
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,799
and that's force negative and false

494
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,840
positive

495
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,240
first negative in the center since the

496
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,120
end point since the etr solution or xdr

497
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,799
is not updated

498
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,120
then it should not actually detect

499
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,720
anything you see some things first

500
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
negative receipt things are actually

501
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,280
malicious as benign it just you do not

502
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,799
pick it up and also accuracy that's

503
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,480
false positive accuracy of what is

504
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480
actually been dictated

505
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,720
so what is expected is the combination

506
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,200
of trade intelligence and impute

507
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,919
correlation rule we enable

508
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:06,799
these

509
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,960
solutions to dictate in real-time

510
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,640
real-time analysis

511
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,799
updated detection algorithm uh model so

512
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,200
it's also facilitated response response

513
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,280
time will also be facilitated so it's

514
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,880
very crucial integrate uh create

515
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,559
intelligence is very crucial in most of

516
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,640
this solution endpoint solutions the

517
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,919
automatic

518
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,760
response capability

519
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,080
automatic automation capability you

520
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,000
should be able to automate some stuff

521
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,080
so automation in terms of response

522
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,280
automating in terms of tax or low level

523
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,480
activities

524
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,320
some of these are end users might want

525
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,039
to

526
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,320
schedule

527
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,080
updates they might want to share those

528
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,360
can

529
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,720
most of these use cases are very

530
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,559
important and also there are some

531
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,320
low-level activities that we actually

532
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,120
we don't actually affect eventually

533
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,720
overwhelm the analyst the blue teams

534
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,360
so auto professional of malwa if there

535
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,919
is a consolidated playbook

536
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,280
which has been

537
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,880
created it has been designed to most of

538
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,559
the antimicrobial products it should go

539
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,880
a long way in automated automatic

540
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,559
response

541
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,640
uh so automation is very important to

542
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,320
nature is very important to facilitate

543
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,679
the response

544
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,320
so another thing is visualization so

545
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,480
graphical few uh

546
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,080
one challenge one meter challenge around

547
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,720
this is the short investigation period

548
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,280
relative the ratio of investigation to

549
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,600
resolution what is expected based on the

550
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,400
sla metrics based on the agreement and

551
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,280
based on the the best practices is very

552
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,360
short there's a short period to actually

553
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,320
investigate the aim is to resolve so you

554
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,280
don't spend more time at the

555
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,360
investigation page but there are no most

556
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,880
data that has to be

557
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,559
reviewed to

558
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,280
make sense out of this event out of this

559
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,559
alarm

560
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,520
so what what's another thing is there's

561
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,600
no aggregated view

562
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,440
of incidents it's not like incidents are

563
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,400
just one single map one single line that

564
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,840
you can actually observe in egyptian

565
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,520
actually predict that this is actually

566
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,080
what is happening with all accuracy so

567
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,840
in in when you are trying to validate

568
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,600
alarms it is it will go along with there

569
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,760
is a contextual view where there is a

570
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,919
holistic feel of the whole environment

571
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,080
of the whole incidence which can be

572
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,720
achieved with a graphical illustration

573
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,760
so instead of too much details too much

574
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,320
write up too much text in this solution

575
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,000
there should be a relationship between

576
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,679
correlated events

577
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,280
which which can be represented with the

578
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,559
workflow

579
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,640
and also which is also showing the

580
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,440
attack part so some of these ioc uh

581
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,799
extend extent of the present extent how

582
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,960
long has the attacker do a local

583
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,520
environment what are the attack stage

584
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
what are the parts

585
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,799
what what what are the c2 metadata

586
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,840
ips and the likes what are the data says

587
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,520
uh so most of these things you can

588
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,440
actually associate with the graphical

589
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,000
workflow you can actually make sense of

590
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,240
many others and the

591
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,600
response time will be improved

592
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,760
load retention policy

593
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,679
so i would like to

594
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,440
emphasize on the p in apt so we speak to

595
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,520
persistence by persistence persistence

596
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,679
speaks to

597
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,000
uh soothing basically or theory the

598
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,799
first one is the attackers are

599
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,600
not giving up in their intrusion attempt

600
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,640
and also the ket actor

601
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,720
they they they tend to keep it long

602
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,320
provided they tend to keep a loop

603
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,559
provide in your environment for a long

604
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,080
period of time

605
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,080
and once they even compromise any of the

606
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,840
us they

607
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,320
we tend to have a prolonged control of

608
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,799
that boost so some might spawn in your

609
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,720
environment for months some are smart

610
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,480
somebody's looking environment for yes

611
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,200
then uh most of this attack that most of

612
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,559
the attack that has been discovered

613
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,840
discovered that has been like they have

614
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,600
been the environment for six months one

615
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,400
year

616
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
and but the challenge on the part of

617
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,760
analysts is

618
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,480
before analysis completes of

619
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,400
finish the investigation

620
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,640
the log have been pushed

621
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,600
so you have egr you have exterior that

622
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,520
actually keep blocks for based on my

623
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
review i just keep looking for seven

624
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,280
days some for 14 days some for 30 days

625
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,840
so these are very small compared to the

626
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,919
persistent level of apt

627
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:30,880
and

628
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,440
uh what is expected basically is there

629
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,440
should be the capability

630
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,000
to retain lock based on user's demand

631
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,200
this this cannot be linked to a

632
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,799
subscription plan

633
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,559
like okay

634
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,799
the default is assuming the default is

635
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,039
seven days but there is an upgradeable

636
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,360
there's a plan which was which i know

637
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,760
will have a uh cost implication that

638
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,120
okay if you keep if you tend to keep

639
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,000
your love for a year or two years

640
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,600
there's a plan for you just have to

641
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,440
upgrade to the subscription plan

642
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,039
is the capacity is the capability that

643
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,440
we are speaking about now so it can be

644
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,120
that there can be a plan for that become

645
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,360
segregated to different plans

646
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,520
and this log also should be query we

647
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,279
should be able to queries and references

648
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,400
as need

649
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,200
as need demand as the occasion demands

650
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,840
then straight until uh one of the one of

651
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,080
the challenges effective threats in the

652
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,039
environment still trying to bypass some

653
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,840
security control so there is this whole

654
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,159
nozzle there is this demand on

655
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,440
analysts on blue teams to actually

656
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,720
dive into the environment and

657
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,640
do their investigation

658
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
thoroughly so what uh

659
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,279
but the challenge is the data are very

660
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,600
rigid the data has been structured

661
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,000
already so you can actually query and

662
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,559
interact with it uh you can actually

663
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,400
play around with the data so it's very

664
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,600
complex to uh it's not it's also not

665
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,760
robust enough so what is expected is

666
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,840
there should be access to large

667
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,400
data sets on large and filter data set

668
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,000
and easy to query

669
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,720
uh feasibility 8.8 uh once you have

670
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,640
feasibility to endpoint it immediately

671
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,679
complete the the number of cpu the

672
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,840
storage the

673
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,720
the memory that's the ram size the

674
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,640
thing uh the properties of the device

675
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,720
like batteries and the legs so from

676
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,440
there you can actually emphasize once

677
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,600
you can actually know the number

678
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,279
so once you know the number to be very

679
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,679
easy to actually fought evil

680
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,960
sight evil

681
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,320
actually fought evil so

682
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
for example in crypto miners in crypto

683
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
miners we left we don't we we actually

684
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,159
exploit we actually use your system

685
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,159
resources so once you discover that okay

686
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,840
this system is actually

687
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,080
the complete level is actually dropping

688
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,960
or

689
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,440
the usage is actually very high you can

690
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,039
make some influence from there another

691
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,960
very important part is that the

692
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
feasibility the the visibility of the

693
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,360
end into the endpoints also give

694
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,159
an insight into outdated program

695
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,799
like outdated uh system program and

696
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,080
application program where you can now

697
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,400
engage with federal patching or

698
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,880
adversary reports

699
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,200
so advanced threat detection

700
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,000
so

701
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,480
the challenge with this is the detection

702
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,400
is inaccurate

703
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,039
large backlog alarms

704
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,360
heavily require analysis validation

705
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,960
right you actually require analysis to

706
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,400
validate this

707
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,840
to finally do that is actually right

708
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,520
because it's not accurate

709
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,600
so what is expected is uh there should

710
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,000
be accurate and precise classifications

711
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,960
engine

712
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,039
which is very direct this is actually

713
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,000
bad this is good this is suspicious this

714
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,200
is benign

715
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,520
just three-phase bad suspicious and

716
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,640
benign

717
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,600
so

718
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,480
of free and successful also the status

719
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,919
as this guy actually compromise an

720
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,039
environment and just to allocate

721
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,799
priority levels severities so

722
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,159
the next so in between detection and

723
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,600
detection automation response there is

724
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,480
the

725
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,240
machine learning algorithm that is

726
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,200
needed so these are the

727
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,480
machines these are the mode that has

728
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,480
been used over time

729
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,080
these are the mood that has been used

730
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,200
over time

731
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,240
uh but despite all these smoothies that

732
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,679
you see discover

733
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,279
most of the challenges analysts have is

734
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,080
this model every every vendor tends to

735
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,000
preach that they they use

736
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,600
machine learning and air in their

737
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,240
detection algorithm but it has little or

738
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,399
no impact in the production environment

739
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,039
this is actually a very big challenge

740
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,840
so and another thing is uh so what's

741
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,320
what is requirement what is recommended

742
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
is apart from the mood that you should

743
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,159
use a useful model but there should be

744
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,080
emphasis on the data on the input stage

745
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,399
also which is the data so the data that

746
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,799
you actually use to train the model you

747
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,399
should be relevant

748
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,480
and that that speaks to the quality of

749
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,679
the data also so the quality of the data

750
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,159
together with useful model

751
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,080
we actually go a long way so the

752
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,120
response action and recovery so

753
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120
detection alone is not enough

754
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
response is the end

755
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,559
so response and recovery is the end

756
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,080
so most of the time you discover that

757
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,279
okay of what benefit is detection alone

758
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,480
to

759
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,960
a pc or an endpoint that has actually

760
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,240
been ransomed

761
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,960
or there's unavailability of service and

762
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,799
you actually need to study that it's

763
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,559
obvious already so

764
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,159
response action

765
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,880
sometimes also would actually stop at

766
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,559
quarantine stage

767
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,640
so that is actually not smart enough

768
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,360
there should be a way to recover

769
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,960
because malware removed

770
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,640
my weight actually cleaned their trays

771
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,679
that i removed themselves after after

772
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,080
after infecting the pc so removing it or

773
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,399
even they put this is not actually smart

774
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,320
so what is expected is recovery fuel

775
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,919
recovery so expectation is uh there

776
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,840
should be forensic capability and you

777
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,080
see the response capability by this i

778
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,440
mean you should be able to connect life

779
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,399
to uh remotely and execute some commands

780
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,960
to get data

781
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,600
and also uh another thing that is

782
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,520
similar is

783
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,679
uh collection of

784
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,120
it there there should be a complete rule

785
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,279
back and clean snapshot so that's the

786
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,760
speak to recovery so the response action

787
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,440
should be stealthy

788
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,240
just uh in other states

789
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,679
in the sense that you should uniquely

790
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,440
terminate malicious processes and

791
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,880
sub-processes

792
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,880
so if there is only one supplement that

793
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,520
is malicious uniquely terminated

794
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,600
without infecting others

795
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,559
then others are offline protections uh

796
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,480
audit users that speaks to

797
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,640
non-repudiation accountability and

798
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,980
authentications uh

799
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,279
[Music]

800
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,600
flexible rule-based assets most of the

801
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,520
time you describe the solution only have

802
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,320
like two rules uh one is the admin which

803
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,640
is not logical and ethical to give

804
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,120
everybody the admin this the second one

805
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,720
is the low level

806
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,760
privileges so in as much as you have to

807
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,399
enforce this privilege principle but

808
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,399
there should be some rule there should

809
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,720
be some flexibility in between based on

810
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,000
the

811
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,840
need of the analysis based on what the

812
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,360
analysis intends to

813
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,440
actually use the

814
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,080
anti-malware product for also very

815
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,000
important it's very important the east

816
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,679
which which you can split reports

817
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,080
various type of reports the executive

818
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,640
reports the technical reports that are

819
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,880
deals with technical content

820
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,440
so it's very important the ease and the

821
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,600
frequency and the content the rich

822
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,679
content of the report

823
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:40,640
so

824
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,880
secondly in the pillars of uh endpoint

825
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,799
security we have the people on process

826
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,559
so what is expected of the people what's

827
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,080
expected of the process what players are

828
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,000
expected

829
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,240
so one of the issues that one of the

830
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,399
challenges of our time is uh policies

831
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,799
that are implemented like byod bring

832
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,440
your own devices so how do you

833
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,480
um

834
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,559
how do you how do you track

835
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,360
how do you track byod like i bring my

836
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,519
endpoint to the environment and how do

837
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,000
you track this to maintain sanitary and

838
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,600
also procedure there should be a

839
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,519
procedure in place to android third

840
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,039
party uh delay management uh management

841
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,799
approval sometimes when you want to

842
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,480
implement some policy or when you want

843
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,760
to

844
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,240
do some stuff you have uh that is

845
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,919
possible of delaying money maria

846
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,480
approval and also during trouble

847
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,559
shooting section uh they require

848
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,720
privilege trust level disputes with

849
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,480
trust level in between the

850
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,880
uh engineers and uh

851
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,519
and finally the system has do most of

852
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,840
the time do oversales or for shoot

853
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,960
project capabilities this was a very

854
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,279
big challenge

855
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,200
so lastly on the blue team it is

856
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
expected of the blue team to maximize

857
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,760
the capability of the endpoint solutions

858
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,279
so there's a case study there's a

859
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,720
there's a scenario with the new york

860
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,320
times whereby the new york times have

861
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,880
been breached i like up like 45 malware

862
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,880
samples that have been run by the apt

863
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,360
and the semantic i'll put that only

864
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,480
detected one so the semantic uh

865
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,600
uh spoke personally reverted from the

866
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,399
you can check this on the url that they

867
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,440
did not actually they only enabled the

868
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,200
antivirus detection they didn't actually

869
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,279
maximize the capability and the fact

870
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,440
based on my software i discovered

871
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,120
most of the time either analysis i don't

872
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,200
maximize that they have naturally

873
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,559
explore

874
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,519
the

875
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,679
the potential what's the capability of

876
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,600
the utility features so they're not

877
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,360
actually maximizing it

878
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,159
so

879
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,080
deploying this measure should be steady

880
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,039
enough you should use the maximum

881
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,039
security as much as possible based on

882
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,399
your use case

883
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,919
and also uh parameters so analysts can

884
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,240
often discover that okay these are the

885
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,840
configuration that actually is taking

886
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,840
most of system resources and because

887
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,279
they can they can schedule this to

888
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,240
off-peak period or upgrade the pc

889
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,559
upgrade the hardware also cross-platform

890
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,519
correlation instead of focusing on a one

891
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,840
solution you know you can use correlated

892
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,880
effects across various platform

893
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,279
trainees is very important training is

894
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,200
very important and lastly uh edr users

895
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,320
often

896
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,200
uninstall freedom to all installed most

897
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,960
of them they all install

898
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,440
the agent for agent base

899
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,600
for confidence

900
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,519
so out of scope what is out of scope of

901
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,360
this study once that's out of school

902
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,360
this study is the cost of implication of

903
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,120
most of these

904
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,760
uh check boxes so most of the house cost

905
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,640
implications is not discussed uh review

906
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,039
of agent and agentless centralized and

907
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,279
decentralized servers management is not

908
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,200
it's not discussed

909
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,320
suitability or perfect machine learning

910
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,519
model i'm not recommending any vendors

911
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,440
so we are looking at a baseline to

912
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,679
dictate or to actually

913
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,600
uh choose fender but i'm not actually

914
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,159
recommending anything though precisely

915
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,320
so thank you

916
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,639
thank you everyone

917
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,040
[Music]

918
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,119
you
