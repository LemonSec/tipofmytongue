1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,210
now to introduce our first speaker

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,029
we have Paul vixie presenting the

3
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:08,069
modality of mortality and domain names

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:10,170
and please give him a warm round of

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:17,430
applause thank you and thank you for

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,520
coming I know there's a CTI

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,560
summit in the other room and I expect a

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,449
lot of you like me would rather be in

9
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,980
there than in here but I have stuff to

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,560
share let me give you a little bit of

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,899
the background how I came into this

12
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,700
information so I worked in the DNS field

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,760
for about 20 years so I maintained bind

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,550
back before DNS was sexy and that was

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,480
the only implementation we had started a

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,800
company called internet systems

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,719
consortium it's a non-profit the Dow

18
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,770
owns bind and runs a fruit and some

19
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,969
we're in the middle of that I started

20
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,210
the first anti-spam company called Maps

21
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,579
the mail abuse prevention system was

22
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,769
also spam spelled backward we thought we

23
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,460
were very clever I later got sued out of

24
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,310
business we had to sell maps to Trend

25
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,860
Micro in order to pay our own lawyers

26
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,479
because it turns out when you stop

27
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,210
people from sending spam they sue you

28
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,840
who knew the passion that drove that

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,439
project was personal in other words I

30
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,689
had been working on the internet trying

31
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:32,610
to make communication easier for two

32
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,750
decades by that time and maybe a decade

33
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,180
and a half and to see it abused by these

34
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,979
extractive personalities known as

35
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,130
spammers really made me angry that

36
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,240
pattern repeats so fast forward to 2010

37
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,670
the old rbl that we invented was great

38
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,060
for email although inadequate the

39
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,530
servile folks had to come up with our

40
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,840
HSV L in order to make sure that domains

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,149
could have reputations in the eyes of

42
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:08,818
mail servers and the rbl we invented was

43
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,669
just for IP addresses to have

44
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,280
reputations in the

45
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,590
of mail servers but we saw that there

46
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,030
was an awful lot of Internet traffic

47
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,080
that was not email and so in 2010 we

48
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,530
developed the rpz the response policy

49
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,200
zone which is a way to publish and

50
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,130
subscribe to policy about dns resolution

51
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,130
it's become quite popular it's it's in

52
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,790
bind it's in cannot and there is an

53
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,560
implementation of it for unbound and

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,239
it's really cool because rather than let

55
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:45,850
the DNS resolution succeed and then deal

56
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,100
with maybe blocking the connection to a

57
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,440
malicious party you can simply block the

58
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,070
DNS resolution so that's the kind of

59
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,890
thing I do started as a DNS guy got

60
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,180
angry started doing security innovation

61
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,269
and that's what leads to this effort we

62
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:10,200
have a large network of open source

63
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,480
passive dns collectors we see two

64
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,640
hundred thousand cache misses every

65
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,650
second of every day and we store them

66
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,570
there's no surveillance no PII we've

67
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,019
been never see an end user IP address

68
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,860
but we do have a pretty extensive

69
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,049
picture of the content of DNS even

70
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:33,970
though by policy we never remember who

71
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,440
looked something up or where they were

72
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,420
we do like to know what was looked up

73
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,750
and what was available at various times

74
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,200
and one of the things we now know is the

75
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,930
rate of creation of new domain names so

76
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,150
we're gonna explain sort of what a newly

77
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,799
observed domain name is and what the

78
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:56,500
variations are because the details are

79
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,640
always fun if I see anybody fall asleep

80
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,600
I'll skip that slide but I don't want to

81
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,880
explain what we did we actually took a

82
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,970
look at a cohort of newly observed

83
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,640
domain names and studied them

84
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,320
longitudinally to find out what happens

85
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,570
to them because the public policy around

86
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,909
domain name creation is that more is

87
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:24,550
better faster is better and cheaper is

88
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,180
better

89
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,490
and I think that that is a mistake I

90
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,590
would like to inform public policy with

91
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,070
some of the impacts of of those three

92
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,940
assertions because I think we can do

93
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,560
better I have a proposal at the end so

94
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,560
we're getting around two terabytes a day

95
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,289
two hundred thousand a second we've been

96
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:49,990
storing the unique patterns that we see

97
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,440
in that in that data since 2010 that

98
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,860
database is itself available if you if

99
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,330
you want to make commercial use of it

100
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,830
I'll charge you if you don't if you want

101
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,900
to make private non-commercial use of it

102
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,360
I won't so please don't be don't be shy

103
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,370
about contacting us and we have a number

104
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,430
of real-time channels that derive from

105
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,449
the raw passive DNS one of which is a

106
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,460
channel that contains only newly

107
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,830
observed domains and I want to be

108
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,520
somewhat careful here by a newly

109
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,229
observed domain I mean a delegation

110
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:29,770
point so example.com is a delegation

111
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,370
point www.example.com is not that's

112
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,349
something you create for yourself or ask

113
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:37,449
assistant min to do but to get

114
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:39,520
example.com in the first place you have

115
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,280
to go to a registrar and possibly pay

116
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,169
money and so and so forth and that

117
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:46,090
create that's called a delegation point

118
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,199
because at example.com the the

119
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,840
administrative control of names changes

120
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,449
because in comm it's for its Verisign

121
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:58,139
but at example.com it changes its you

122
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,360
and those delegation points are the

123
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,419
backbone of the DNS industry it is the

124
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:07,270
creation and takedown of those that

125
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,669
drives the life of anybody in this room

126
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:13,120
who is looking at the systemic digital

127
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,340
violence rather than you know studying

128
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,960
and only what's happening inside of a

129
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,520
single CPU and I have made all kinds of

130
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,960
estimates and assertions and we finally

131
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,020
decided you know people don't believe

132
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:34,000
that stuff it sounds truthy and you know

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,400
in my defense at the time I said at 95%

134
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,650
of new domains were junky and malicious

135
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,319
but it's less now and that was a

136
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,330
surprise and we thought what if we had

137
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,520
objective science where people could

138
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,210
study for themselves what these domains

139
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,300
are and how they get used and especially

140
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,389
how they die and when they die and

141
00:06:54,389 --> 00:07:00,460
that's what occasions this paper so we

142
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,840
thought let's just do a seven day study

143
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,849
right if a domain dies after seven days

144
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:09,819
that's not sudden I mean it's still a

145
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:14,139
little unusual I can I cannot imagine

146
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:18,310
that virus bullets and dot-com whatever

147
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,650
or any other valuable property would

148
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,690
ever be created in destroyed in eight

149
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,909
days but nevertheless we wanted to look

150
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:27,250
at things that had truly short lifetimes

151
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,740
and so although we did a 90-day study we

152
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,139
collected about three new delegation

153
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:34,120
points a second for 90 days we only

154
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,159
really studied what happened to each of

155
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:39,400
them for seven days so it's possible

156
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
that there are other modes of death

157
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,500
other graph clusters further out in the

158
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,830
timeline than what we have looked at I

159
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,659
would encourage you to ask us for the

160
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:51,909
data set or a similar new data set so

161
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,050
that you could do your own study

162
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,389
I'd love to cooperate with anyone who

163
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:59,979
wants to do that so to find out what

164
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,479
happens to a domain name you have to

165
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:05,440
query it and we do have observations we

166
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,360
certainly see these names get used but

167
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,469
no DNS collection network is complete

168
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:14,349
no one has 100% observability so we

169
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:15,849
didn't want to just look at the passive

170
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:17,550
feed we decided me to ask the question

171
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,139
does this thing still exist does it

172
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:22,569
still point where it did before if it

173
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,099
doesn't still exist where did the

174
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:26,590
failure occur was it removed by the

175
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,810
registry was removed by the registrar

176
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,649
possibly by the registrant was not

177
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,448
removed at all from the delegation

178
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:35,830
system but the

179
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,049
authoritative nameserver operator took

180
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:41,860
it down and then finally did one of our

181
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,560
colleagues in one of the still existing

182
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,110
Network reputation systems such as Sir

183
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,589
ball or spam house to take it out

184
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:52,450
because once you've been listed in one

185
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,980
of those reputation systems you are

186
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,649
effectively dead and I like that by the

187
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:01,149
way so we made about twenty queries for

188
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,820
each one and we did them on successive

189
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,089
powers of two to avoid overloading the

190
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,370
system so you know we did one when we

191
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,200
first saw it one a thousand seconds

192
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,029
later two thousand seconds later and so

193
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:17,550
on out to seven days and if something

194
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,250
dies in more than one way we in this

195
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,690
study are only going to tell you the

196
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,820
first first form of death in other words

197
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,860
if it disappeared from the authority

198
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,970
name server and then two days later

199
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:32,470
disappeared from the registry then we

200
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,880
don't account for that here it's in our

201
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,320
data but we didn't think that that was

202
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:41,529
an interesting follow-on effect now we

203
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:42,520
need to talk a little bit about

204
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,899
effective second-level domains simply

205
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:49,480
because these delegation points can

206
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,470
occur outside of the I can register your

207
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,589
registrar system so I normally say a

208
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:58,149
delegation point is something you can

209
00:09:58,149 --> 00:09:59,560
buy from GoDaddy or one of their

210
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,990
competitors but there's more to it than

211
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,670
that because inside of cloud app net

212
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,870
there are delegation points where in

213
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,709
this case a juror is going to be giving

214
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,990
a sub-domain to a customer that they

215
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,050
then manage and so there's a long list

216
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,940
of these so-called public suffixes and

217
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,160
you can get it at public suffix org if

218
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,199
you don't already know about it that's

219
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:31,839
usually used by browsers to decide

220
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,640
cookie policy but it turns out to be

221
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,010
ideal for our purpose as well and very

222
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,690
complete so I told you what a newly

223
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,029
observed delegation point is or a newly

224
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:47,459
observed domain for simplicity

225
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:50,679
we when we tried it when we discuss this

226
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:53,529
use the terms that are common in the

227
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,019
community rather than common inside the

228
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:58,299
DNS technical field so newly observed

229
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:00,849
host is simply one of those longer names

230
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:04,539
that is underneath a delegation point so

231
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,579
printer for dot example.com is an

232
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:09,399
example of a host in this parlance

233
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,949
they're not all hosts they are all kinds

234
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:14,649
of other things but to call them fully

235
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:17,169
qualified domain names or fqdn would be

236
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:19,029
to lose our audience and so we call them

237
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:21,549
host names but I need you to know the

238
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:23,409
difference so we're seeing between two

239
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:25,809
and three newly observed delegation

240
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:27,639
points every second we're also seeing

241
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,859
about a hundred and fifty newly observed

242
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:32,499
fully qualified Zoar host names every

243
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:36,699
second that's a lot and even if you

244
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:38,379
consider that the Internet has become a

245
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:41,739
global infrastructure and has billions

246
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:43,959
of people using it that is an awful lot

247
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:47,199
of domain creation those fully qualified

248
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:49,689
names it's very difficult for me to

249
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:53,199
imagine that 150 times a second some

250
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:55,359
system administrator remembers some host

251
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:57,909
and has to edit his own file or you know

252
00:11:57,909 --> 00:11:59,949
that adds something I just I think

253
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:01,929
there's something else in there we

254
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,819
haven't studied that but I just want you

255
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:08,889
to know 150 is unreasonable okay so

256
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:13,029
let's get to the numbers we had about 11

257
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:15,639
million of these total over a six month

258
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:21,369
study we found that of them 10 million

259
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:25,659
survived longer than a week that was a

260
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:27,429
lot higher than I expected

261
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:30,579
when I first looked at this back in 2012

262
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:34,859
or so about half were dead in a day so

263
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:37,509
that means we have to rerun this study

264
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:39,699
every year to find out what the trends

265
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:44,529
are but of those million or so that are

266
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:48,009
dead in under a week that 8% we are

267
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:51,129
interested in how did they die and what

268
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:52,569
characteristics do they have in common

269
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:54,939
besides that death assigns that early

270
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:57,139
death

271
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:00,179
so here you've got the median at seven

272
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,239
hours and you're reaching 61% of the

273
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:05,160
total that will be dead in a week are

274
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,879
actually dead in less than a day

275
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:14,609
so really the the mark of death is on

276
00:13:14,609 --> 00:13:16,169
these domains from the moment of their

277
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,850
birth as far as I can tell from these

278
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,249
numbers if you're gonna die will be

279
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:25,199
early and you know that shouldn't

280
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:27,959
surprise us because this is the selected

281
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,359
this is the biased selection of domain

282
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:31,919
names that were used to annoy somebody

283
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,809
there four complaints occurred there for

284
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:37,169
some kind of takedown occurred we

285
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:39,540
believe that a lot of the truly

286
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,559
short-lived ones are taken down by their

287
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,230
owners because they've they were only

288
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,389
used for a single targeted attack and

289
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:50,970
are no longer needed

290
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,339
but I don't have data to back that up so

291
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,619
they make me making stuff up at the

292
00:13:55,619 --> 00:14:00,299
podium so the black line is the total

293
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,220
showing that eight percent number and

294
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,259
what you can see in the Green Line is

295
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:06,569
that the single greatest contributor is

296
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:09,419
black listing which we used to call

297
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:11,850
black holding back when RB element real

298
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,499
time black hole list instead of whatever

299
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:17,879
it means now but there is a about a

300
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,319
third of the ones that are going to die

301
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:22,079
are removed by the delegator in other

302
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,319
words some registry or registrar action

303
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:29,059
took place and a vanishingly small

304
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:31,139
percentage of first cause of death

305
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,119
happen because an authority name server

306
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:36,149
operator took out the content just

307
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:38,160
removed the zone from the server and no

308
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,549
longer offered publication services that

309
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:45,269
also interests me because that I think

310
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:47,519
is an opportunity I think figuring out a

311
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,470
way to route complaints do those people

312
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,069
might get that red line up a little bit

313
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:54,359
you may be able to tell that I'm still

314
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:56,069
somewhat passionate about domain names

315
00:14:56,069 --> 00:15:00,229
not being used to do me harm

316
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:07,019
right so black listing is really

317
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,100
effective and here I think we have to

318
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,960
to the Spamhaus team because they have

319
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,540
really led the charge on automation

320
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,700
between their spam traps and their other

321
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,340
real-time data sources and their policy

322
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:22,030
output and you know the there are other

323
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,130
distributed reputation systems that are

324
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,780
as fast but they were the first ones to

325
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,270
be that fast and so they are really

326
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:31,660
encouraging rapid reaction and you have

327
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,780
to have a rapid reaction there are

328
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,220
spammers out there who if you let them

329
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,140
keep their domain name for a full 15

330
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,940
minutes they have already made all of

331
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,860
the profit they ever expect to make and

332
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,540
they no longer care if you take it down

333
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,140
so if part of our goal here is to treat

334
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,710
war as economics and drive up the costs

335
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,390
of our adversaries then we're going to

336
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:57,040
have to be quick about it as I said most

337
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,170
of the blacklisting is most of

338
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,810
everything is in the first 24 hours and

339
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,230
we didn't see any second load here

340
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,400
there's a lot that happens early and

341
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,870
then it tails off in the normal way

342
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,820
these are the deaths that occur not from

343
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,980
blacklisting but because of a registrar

344
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,610
like GoDaddy or a registry like Verisign

345
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,930
says ok that's it I got too many

346
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,580
complaints about that I'm taking it out

347
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:26,170
and this was a little bit interesting to

348
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,690
see that peak and a day and a half I

349
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,380
don't know what's going on there I

350
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,490
understand what's happening in a 51

351
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,550
minutes but that day and a half doesn't

352
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,760
correlate to anything else I've seen

353
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,380
unless it's some automated procedure

354
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,820
where it gets queued for deletion at the

355
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,650
end of the day and then maybe there's a

356
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,060
cron job that runs at midnight that

357
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,950
actually executes all of the deletion

358
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,570
requests that have queued up I don't

359
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:56,230
know I expect I'm going to have to walk

360
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,640
the streets and go talk to those people

361
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,190
to find out what underlies the day and a

362
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,950
half peek and the rest of it is a simple

363
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,839
distribution from four days out to seven

364
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,650
it has the net normal tail off so even

365
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,400
though it's a very small percentage of

366
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,440
the total it's still 20,000 names that

367
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,060
got killed off at the authoritative

368
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,760
nameserver and that peak at fort

369
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,209
is is another mystery I understand the

370
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,890
12 hours I don't understand the four

371
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,380
days if you're doing this and you know

372
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,180
why you're doing it at that level please

373
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,380
inform me so let's talk a little bit

374
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,740
about the types of top-level domains

375
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,500
that are encouraging this behavior some

376
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,930
of you have heard me rant about the new

377
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,180
generic top-level domain program from

378
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,620
ICANN

379
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,880
in which I have said the reason we

380
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,540
needed almost 2,000 new TLDs is because

381
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,210
spammers did not have enough choices I

382
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,870
stand by those remarks and the study

383
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,310
bolsters that preconception so indeed

384
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,230
most of what's going to die is gonna die

385
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,280
in a new TLD and there's about a even

386
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,260
split among what's left between the

387
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,170
legacy and the ComNet org that kind of

388
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,510
thing and the ccTLDs it's worth

389
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,730
remembering the country code TLD czar

390
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,140
sovereigns they don't have to follow

391
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,110
ICANN policy they tend to do so because

392
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,780
they helped make that policy but they

393
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,090
need not and so there are some hotspots

394
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,940
among the tier the country code and TLDs

395
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,700
who use their sovereignty to pretty much

396
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,800
annoy anybody they want or their

397
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,810
customers want to annoy without facing

398
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,930
any kind of recourse for it we saw very

399
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,720
little of this inside the IDN space the

400
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,180
new internationalized domain name TL DS

401
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,420
I think there just isn't enough use for

402
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,010
there to have been enough malicious

403
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,960
domains created in order for them to

404
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,180
really represent a large sample of this

405
00:18:54,180 --> 00:19:02,630
total and here are the actual results

406
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,870
not cricket is the worst of the worst in

407
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,610
terms of things that could get created

408
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,100
and then get wiped out very quickly I

409
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,500
was really shocked to see Tokyo in this

410
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,400
list where are they oh wait they're in

411
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,820
the next list dot business surprises

412
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,250
nobody there have been years where I

413
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,140
simply rejected all mail from anything

414
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,440
ending in dot biz

415
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,870
because there was nothing I hadn't there

416
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,019
was no cost to rejecting all of it I

417
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:34,059
think that science is a little bit of a

418
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:38,919
surprise nevertheless these are the GTL

419
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:43,059
DS the the top 25 that actually had a

420
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:45,519
few thousand deletions we didn't have

421
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,169
enough room to represent all of the ones

422
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:48,759
that touched our study but these are the

423
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:56,529
significant ones right and move right

424
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,590
along here so drilling into a few of

425
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,080
these not XYZ is a little bit

426
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,039
controversial they they've had a lot of

427
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,080
free domain programs where they're

428
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,370
trying to you know bolster their

429
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,809
position in the internet by not charging

430
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,779
people that had predictable effects

431
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:17,860
which you can see here dot top I don't

432
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,169
understand I don't know what people

433
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:21,309
think it means or what they think

434
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:23,440
they're conveying by buying a name that

435
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,519
ends in dot top but it's a bad place bad

436
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,049
network neighborhood I'm gonna have to

437
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:34,029
skip forward over some of this and the

438
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:36,730
interests of time for comparison

439
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:41,259
purposes this is a common net so you

440
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:44,230
know these numbers that it's all scaled

441
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,059
but you'll see it as a smaller scale

442
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:50,350
than the not top and dot XYZ I want to

443
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,149
say by the way the paper covers this in

444
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:54,460
detail and is short and readable so I

445
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,500
encourage you if I've piqued your

446
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,049
interest at all you know please go go

447
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,940
read through the paper which has much

448
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,039
more complete description of these

449
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,850
trends but anyway these are old this

450
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,009
data has not changed for common net for

451
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:10,690
many years and I think that's largely

452
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,820
because all the good names are taken and

453
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,799
so the ones that get created are part of

454
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,659
a diminishing pool of things that could

455
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:20,580
actually look meaningful if written down

456
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,299
you can see here how the dot EU 3 dollar

457
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:28,840
price contributes to its presence in

458
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,330
this chart and we've got the the leading

459
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:35,470
free cctlds and then we've got pretty

460
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,680
expensive one I was shocked that

461
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,860
I owe at $33 each had a high death rate

462
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,890
compared to you know dot uk' and dot us

463
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,680
and all the others that are very cheap

464
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,380
so there really isn't a correlation I

465
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,110
mean there there is some anecdotal

466
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,870
evidence that being free it gets you

467
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,520
more abuse but weeks we would have

468
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,650
predicted that but it's not a strong

469
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,830
correlation that means that the bad guys

470
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,990
who are using these things in order to

471
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,300
anchor their attacks are not price

472
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,000
sensitive and that again was a surprise

473
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,040
at least the ones that were responsible

474
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:16,650
for this cohort dot TK is a perennial

475
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,990
favorite of mine I was actually its

476
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:23,760
custodian for a brief time and it is a

477
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,400
hotbed of things nobody wants to talk to

478
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,860
in my RPG config and home I allow tcl/tk

479
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,660
because tickle is a computer programming

480
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,730
language that decided to register under

481
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,450
TK but I don't allow anything else I

482
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,400
just black hole the whole TLD because

483
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,630
you know toka Lo is a tiny little

484
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,430
Pacific island off the shore of New

485
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,230
Zealand and is full of people who don't

486
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,200
mean me harm and didn't need this domain

487
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,300
name and so it is leased to a guy in

488
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,020
Amsterdam who means me harm or at least

489
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,340
allows his customers to do me harm so

490
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,610
that their there are some long-term

491
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,840
impacts that will be felt by bad

492
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,700
behavior unfortunately it's going to be

493
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,190
felt by those Pacific Islanders if they

494
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:17,280
ever want their nose ccTLD back dot CC

495
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:23,790
is pretty low it just this is the normal

496
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,650
this is actually a picture of the norm

497
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:32,700
so what can I tell you three years ago I

498
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:38,850
proposed to ICANN that new domain names

499
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,150
should be allocated and then put on a

500
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:46,710
public message board of some kind before

501
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,080
they went live you could call it a

502
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,190
public comment period

503
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,509
if you wanted but we're not looking for

504
00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:53,669
comments what we're looking for is an

505
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:56,970
opportunity for the reputation industry

506
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,120
you know sir bol Spamhaus of everybody

507
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,279
who studies domain names to have a head

508
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:05,220
start to be able to see ok this domain

509
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,840
name with those name servers and this

510
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,700
Whois information is going to go live in

511
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,610
whatever 24 hours 10 minutes even 10

512
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,440
minutes would make a difference because

513
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,909
that way you would have a chance to say

514
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:16,500
you know this has too much in common

515
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,230
with other patterns that have turned out

516
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,419
to be uniformly malicious and I'm just

517
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:26,370
I'm gonna black hole that with even

518
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,830
before it exists because otherwise it's

519
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,070
forced upon us in its moment of creation

520
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,559
and becomes immediately globally usable

521
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,330
and by the way that was a hard technical

522
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:38,580
problem to get that instant global

523
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,490
propagation of this metadata so I'm

524
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,899
proud of the team that made that happen

525
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,669
but I'm not proud of how it's being used

526
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:47,100
and I would like to give the reputation

527
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,799
people a head start on the malicious

528
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,899
actors and what we're doing in the in

529
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:54,690
the meantime because I got left laughed

530
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,610
out of the room when I suggested that I

531
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:00,299
can what we're doing is to publish an

532
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,090
RPG that just has newly observed names I

533
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,820
means once a second we update this DNS

534
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,129
policy feed to add the two or three

535
00:25:08,129 --> 00:25:11,610
domain names we've seen and then delete

536
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,350
the ones that are now too old to qualify

537
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:17,549
as new so what do you think is new might

538
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,610
be ten minutes might be 24 hours but we

539
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,080
have a number of different art disease

540
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,750
that have different total durations but

541
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,700
it means that in my house a domain name

542
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,070
that has first been observed by Farsight

543
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,799
in the last 10 minutes doesn't work so

544
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:35,009
if my kids click on something that is in

545
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:38,909
that category they get a 404 error I am

546
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:40,830
strangely okay with that because I grew

547
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,019
up at a time that you used to send email

548
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:45,299
with an ASCII template and wait three

549
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:47,039
days for a new domain name and that was

550
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:52,830
quick enough so I would like the public

551
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,309
policy people to take a look at what's

552
00:25:56,309 --> 00:25:57,990
happening with the domain names that

553
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,240
their policies are allowed

554
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,990
to be created and see if we can make it

555
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,590
easier for the blacklisting industry to

556
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:09,320
do their work or perhaps just make it

557
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,340
easier

558
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,460
maybe cause domain names to be hard a

559
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,200
little harder to get because right now

560
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,080
they are too cheap to meter I have about

561
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,220
three minutes for questions
