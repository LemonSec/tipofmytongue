1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,340
okay everybody if you'd please take your

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,609
seats

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:17,080
sameer full disclosure in case you don't

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,980
know I work for easy Melissa works for

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,130
ESET but that's not why I'm expecting a

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:38,859
good that's that was your so my

7
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:40,539
motivation for doing this talk is to

8
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:42,219
address the problems and complaints that

9
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:44,079
I've heard over the years from people

10
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,730
who've been getting into the industry as

11
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,100
well as people finding more senior level

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,809
positions and this is such a new

13
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:50,499
industry

14
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:52,749
nothing is clearly set in stone and that

15
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:57,850
causes problems as well as benefits it's

16
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,059
not clear because it's not set in stone

17
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:02,979
we have a tendency to repeat things that

18
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,170
work well once which leads us to having

19
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,420
a large percentage of wong small subset

20
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,300
of people i think we all have a gut

21
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,160
understanding that no one of us can know

22
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,690
everything about security or even

23
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,650
something specific like malware research

24
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,520
there are a lot of things to know and a

25
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,830
lot of things to experience the more

26
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,810
different brains and experiences that we

27
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,030
can put together the stronger and more

28
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,980
resilient we all are it's important to

29
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,120
keep this in mind when we're putting

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,160
together security teams the more

31
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,930
different people we can put in one group

32
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,370
the more we can combine all of that

33
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,380
knowledge the better we're able to see

34
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,580
into the dark corners of the internet

35
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,010
the process of including more people is

36
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,900
about improving the way we do things for

37
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,330
everyone i hope to help you step back

38
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,430
and view things differently so that we

39
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,350
can all examine what dark corners we

40
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,030
might be missing from our own acquiring

41
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:54,550
practices whether or not you believe our

42
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,560
talent pipeline is too thin the fact is

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,930
it leaks like a sieve there are quite a

44
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,610
few systemic problems which boil down to

45
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,530
the effect of common mistakes being

46
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,270
amplified when they're all combined in

47
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,970
the US as in many other countries the

48
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,590
move to incorporate computer skills has

49
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,200
been very late in coming and in low and

50
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,120
low income in rural areas it's been

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,299
especially so teachers have little

52
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:17,580
understanding of how computers

53
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,320
much less how to instruct kids how to

54
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,330
use them safely this means a lot of the

55
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,590
kids who are getting to college are

56
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,900
already way behind their peers in terms

57
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,490
of being comfortable with technology

58
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,830
these kids are likely to shy away from

59
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,620
getting computer science degrees and

60
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,970
there's a feeling that computing and

61
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,880
security in general are more like a

62
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,700
magical security skill or like Wizards

63
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,920
skill that only a select few people can

64
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,900
do well we might like to think that

65
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,580
we're some elite minority of people who

66
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,560
can do what we do the fact is there are

67
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,760
a lot of people who could if they had

68
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,460
the appropriate training and we compound

69
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,860
this further by setting up crazy hurdles

70
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,360
that people have to jump through to get

71
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,190
a job so they may not even intern the

72
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,390
industry if they do get the right

73
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,300
qualifications once they do get hired a

74
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,830
lot of people in the most

75
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,810
underrepresented groups end up leaving

76
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,740
mid-career so what can we do to change

77
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,450
education problems even if they're out

78
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,580
of our direct control we can work with

79
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,320
education groups to help bring kids or

80
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,060
even mid-career switchers into the

81
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,709
industry that can also include

82
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:18,300
volunteering or giving money to

83
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,250
organizations to help kids get computer

84
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,230
education you can talk to your local

85
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,150
legislators about making computer

86
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,430
literacy as mandatory standard for kids

87
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,860
in school providing CS certifications

88
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,540
for teachers or about creating

89
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,209
technology internship programs currently

90
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:35,430
in the u.s. only nine states allow

91
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,930
computer science classes to count as a

92
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,810
math or science credit the availability

93
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,000
of both introductory an introductory and

94
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,650
Advanced Placement CS classes is

95
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,610
decreasing right now in both k12 and

96
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,680
many colleges and universities call it

97
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,780
computer science lags way behind the

98
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,780
current practices in teaching which is

99
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,220
project-based learning that relates a

100
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,040
subject to kids existing knowledge and

101
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,830
interests thus reinforces a view of

102
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,140
computing as lonely and boring I think

103
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,940
we all understand that computing can be

104
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,400
really fun and it is can be a useful

105
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,459
tool but it needs to be taught that way

106
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,720
you can talk to your local university

107
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,850
about what you need from students you

108
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,649
can also hire students as interns or

109
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:19,829
apprentice apprentices natella higher ed

110
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,079
is a better return on investment for the

111
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,610
majority of people or until they start

112
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,440
preparing students to jump into

113
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,120
positions without additional training

114
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,220
reconsider what qualifications you're

115
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,420
asking for for

116
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,740
applicants there are lots of ways to

117
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,050
improve inclusion the most obvious is

118
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,520
improving the percentage of women in

119
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,410
your organization the ideal for

120
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,540
inclusion is to aim for a similar

121
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,000
percentage within your company as is in

122
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,240
your customer base or your local area

123
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,470
we've probably all heard women make up

124
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,300
only 11 percent of the workforce

125
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,150
insecurity in the US while women make up

126
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,670
almost 50 percent of the total workforce

127
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,020
that's kind of a huge gap with a lot of

128
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,150
room for improvement but gender isn't

129
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,680
the only way that representation is

130
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,270
skewed not by a long shot

131
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,280
most of the these groupings are pretty

132
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,930
self-explanatory though neurodiversity

133
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,480
maybe in the new term for most folks the

134
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,710
term includes a wide variety of

135
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,140
different types of mental operating

136
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,140
systems like with unfortunate and

137
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,790
medical names like autism spectrum

138
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,520
disorder attention deficit disorder

139
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,210
dyslexia a fantasia amusia etc from a

140
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,680
threat modeling perspective each of

141
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,600
these demographics will have different

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,300
security and privacy concerns most of

143
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,860
which won't necessarily be obvious to

144
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,780
people outside of these groups each will

145
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,010
have different strengths to bring to the

146
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:40,290
table because the neurodivergent bit is

147
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,720
still so poorly understood and

148
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,100
influences so much of how we interact

149
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,480
with the world I'd like to clarify it a

150
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,610
little further we're still just barely

151
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,470
starting to learn how everyone's brains

152
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,390
actually work quite differently rather

153
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,310
than just assuming we all have the same

154
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,040
thing qubits for example a Fantasia is

155
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,780
lack of mental images which is a

156
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,120
condition that is only been studied in

157
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,020
the last few years

158
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,480
well a museu is a difference in auditory

159
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,010
pitch perception that was discovered

160
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,200
less than two decades ago both of these

161
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,510
things seem pretty simple but they can

162
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,070
have pretty surprising and far-reaching

163
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,380
effects such as in how we understand

164
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,690
instructions or how we proceed tone of

165
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,820
voice learning disorders like dyslexia

166
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,290
have been known about for quite a while

167
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,000
but most of it and most of us have a

168
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,830
pretty passing understanding of what

169
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,620
ADHD and autism are but even then

170
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,880
there's a lot of misinformation about

171
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,610
what these things actually mean for

172
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,810
instance most people have heard that

173
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,180
autism and ADHD mostly affect males and

174
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,490
that it's mostly because the original

175
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,020
studies only included males and a small

176
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,330
subset of males at that the way it

177
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,800
appears in females is different enough

178
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,510
that typically only the girls that are

179
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,009
most

180
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,809
only affected are the ones who are

181
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:45,919
getting likely to get the right

182
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,409
diagnosis the reason there's been a rise

183
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,879
in the number of people being diagnosed

184
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:53,469
is simply because diagnostic criteria

185
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:55,369
likewise are not set in stone they're

186
00:06:55,369 --> 00:06:57,949
not well known and they're not

187
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:00,080
completely nailed down yet in the

188
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,460
general population especially among

189
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,270
women and minority communities learning

190
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,189
disorders such as ADHD in autism and

191
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:09,559
dyslexia are under diagnosed so it's

192
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:10,999
likely to that some of you in the

193
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:12,559
audience are neurodivergent and don't

194
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:13,180
know it yet

195
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,259
and where we find out the more it looks

196
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:17,930
like there's no so-called normal brain

197
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,240
each of us has our unique accommodation

198
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,460
strengths and weaknesses so things we

199
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,349
can do to help people with different

200
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:25,939
neuro types or not just something we do

201
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:27,860
to accommodate one or two people being

202
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,180
considerate of each other's mental

203
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,279
operating system is likely to help a lot

204
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,249
of us main thing to be aware of is that

205
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:35,659
other people don't process information

206
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:37,759
the same that way that we do don't

207
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,319
assume someone's terseness or lack of

208
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,789
eye contact is because they're being

209
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:42,860
rude don't assume that someone who's

210
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,389
always running late is being

211
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:47,209
disrespectful people with sensory

212
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:49,339
processing issues may be overwhelmed by

213
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:51,819
too much noise or light or they may be

214
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,899
distractible by when they have too

215
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:55,819
little input someone may prefer to

216
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:57,379
communicate over email versus phone

217
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:59,149
calls or vice versa sometimes it's

218
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:00,379
helpful to have instructions in writing

219
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,719
or as a diagram some folks have

220
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:04,909
difficult difficulty prioritizing input

221
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:06,830
and may need additional information

222
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:11,469
about what's most important so please

223
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:14,449
ask some of us take words very literally

224
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:15,949
need help identifying when things are

225
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:17,779
not as rigid as we assumed so please ask

226
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:19,729
questions early and often it's better to

227
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:21,860
err on the side of being very clear and

228
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,449
explicit then double checking to make

229
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:24,949
sure you have where your words have been

230
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:28,959
and received the way you intended them

231
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:31,459
and speaking of how the world appears

232
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:33,679
different everyone speak simple and

233
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,779
maybe unintuitive things are critical in

234
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:37,190
making things accessible for different

235
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,049
people without having lived the

236
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,458
experience it may be very difficult to

237
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,198
get a full same sense of how things

238
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:44,120
could be different for someone else for

239
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,649
example if you want to attract a

240
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:47,480
different group say you want to make a

241
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,310
product more usable for people who are

242
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,260
visually challenged and you're having a

243
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,170
hard time getting people who have this

244
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,040
experience so they know you know how

245
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,570
what accommodations need to be made to

246
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,470
make things more usable and it could be

247
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,930
that the area around your office is

248
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,040
really hard to navigate if you have

249
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,690
vision challenges so it might be that

250
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,250
you're having a hard time reaching

251
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,050
people in that group because it's

252
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,339
difficult to navigate to your physical

253
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:15,149
office the basic idea is that if there

254
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:16,319
are groups you're having a hard time

255
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:17,819
reaching it's always a good idea to

256
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:19,980
consult individuals to ask questions to

257
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,329
help elucidate things that might not

258
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:23,220
seem obvious and please listen to the

259
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,120
answers now part of the pipeline

260
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,949
improving the pipeline for security is

261
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:30,899
addressing our image I mentioned before

262
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,550
the weird idea that only a select few

263
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,649
people are capable of doing our jobs I

264
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:37,079
was recently talking to someone who is

265
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:38,850
trying to convince her son to get into

266
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,120
security this is a kid who at 17 having

267
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,130
never touched the car before decided

268
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,560
that he wanted his automatic car to be a

269
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,050
manual car and it's something he wanted

270
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,040
he learned how to do it

271
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,170
this kid is clearly curious he obviously

272
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,449
loves to learn he thought he's better

273
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:56,100
with hardware than mathematics and he

274
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,839
has no college degrees so he couldn't do

275
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,149
security I'm not exactly a traditional

276
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:02,579
security hayek candidate either no one

277
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:04,170
would have ever said hey kid who's

278
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,089
taking too many art classes hey let's go

279
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:07,620
stare at as a text editor all day I

280
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,050
would never have chosen security as a

281
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,029
career had it not been that had I not

282
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,550
had a chance to try it out first I fell

283
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,019
into my first job in this business and I

284
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,339
found out after the fact that it was a

285
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,680
good fit much like improving education

286
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,990
part of our efforts for improving the

287
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,490
image of security is actually getting

288
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,870
people from different groups into the

289
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,420
community creating or funding existing

290
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,790
scholarships for conferences helping to

291
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,750
make sure people are from

292
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,490
underrepresented groups are included in

293
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,339
etc and by improving good community I

294
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,980
mean improving safety for everyone like

295
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,350
for example keep reading and coasting

296
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,480
creating and enforcing codes of conduct

297
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,639
like the one VB did this year making

298
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,500
sure more types of people who are

299
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,329
included as speakers at conferences and

300
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:50,339
standing up for people who are on the

301
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,800
receiving end of jerkish behavior parts

302
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,389
of security industry have historically

303
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:56,550
had very hostile culture towards

304
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,589
everyone especially newcomers and women

305
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:00,389
it's kind of ridiculous to think that

306
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:02,029
we're going to get lots of new people if

307
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:06,589
newly new people are routinely hassled

308
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,569
a code of conduct should be about

309
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,220
establishing norms of behavior rather

310
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,809
than creating rules and regulations

311
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:15,600
those can easily be weaponized against

312
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
people who are not part of the majority

313
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,819
codes of conduct should be created by as

314
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:22,379
diverse a group as you can find whether

315
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:25,139
internally or finding people outside of

316
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:27,509
your organization it shouldn't be the

317
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:29,609
creation of a bunch of lawyers who are

318
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:31,339
just looking to mitigate risk

319
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:33,480
there are things company these are

320
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,679
things that companies can do as well as

321
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:37,559
conferences companies can also decrease

322
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,720
unfair pay gaps by being open about what

323
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,949
people are getting for salary and

324
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:43,199
bonuses and setting clear guidelines

325
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:46,379
about what the criteria are for

326
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:49,230
promotions by being transparent it takes

327
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,730
the guesswork out of whether things are

328
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,499
being applied fairly and this can also

329
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:54,269
help identify dead ends for certain

330
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:57,419
career paths even for technical careers

331
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:59,339
the usual path is going from technical

332
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,689
job to people management and we can all

333
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,279
probably think of someone who was

334
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,199
followed this path it was not

335
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:09,179
particularly suited for it their direct

336
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:10,859
reports may quit they may quit or burn

337
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:12,239
out and it's generally a bad situation

338
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:15,029
all around it's better to ensure senior

339
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:16,619
positions that allow growth within

340
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:19,799
technical skill sets by understanding

341
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,689
where people top out within your

342
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:23,459
organization organization you can set

343
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,259
things up so people can continue to

344
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:27,739
increase both experience and pay in

345
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:29,850
underrepresented groups this can be

346
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,100
extra problem attic as people get passed

347
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,049
over for promotion for reasons that

348
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:35,970
aren't necessarily related to promote to

349
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:36,779
performance

350
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,209
some people may avoid promotions

351
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:41,549
entirely if they see that managers are

352
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:43,459
expected to be a work for insane hours

353
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:46,139
and jobs flexibility is very important

354
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,399
for a lot of different types of people

355
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,860
for people who have children or aging

356
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,660
parents to take care of people who don't

357
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,279
necessarily excel in a busy office

358
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,069
environment the lack of flexibility may

359
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:57,809
limit their promotion prospects so

360
00:12:57,809 --> 00:12:59,369
allowing people to work from home even

361
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:01,319
part-time may improve their ability to

362
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:05,489
get more done when you think about how

363
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:07,709
someone goes from it goes about becoming

364
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:10,049
a doctor there's usually a very set of

365
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:11,819
obvious steps between graduate high

366
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:14,910
school and start seeing patients and it

367
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,919
usually involves a specific path of

368
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,480
education certification and

369
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,429
apprenticeship that really isn't the

370
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:22,739
case for security there's a benefit to

371
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:25,499
this as well as a curse most of us never

372
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:27,480
did an internship or apprenticeship

373
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,759
there's a lot of us here without degrees

374
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,980
or certification we learned on our own

375
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,259
or we learned on the job but the

376
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:36,149
flipside is there's some serious

377
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,089
ambiguity in what the expected path is

378
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:40,619
if you look at existing ads for

379
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,089
positions at any level you'll almost

380
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:44,669
invariably see degree requirements or

381
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:46,049
something vague about equivalent

382
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:48,329
experience which means you're inevitably

383
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:50,249
turning a lot away away a lot of folks

384
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:52,529
so what can we do to turn this around

385
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:54,600
for starters hire people who are

386
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,519
actually entry-level meaning they have

387
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,169
interest and inclination without

388
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:00,869
specific experience you can also what

389
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:03,569
widened widen what counts as experience

390
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:06,360
for example doing projects like making a

391
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,059
blog or helping out in a forum or some

392
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:10,799
community group or creating their own

393
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,069
security tools community college degrees

394
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:15,989
are often seen as less prestigious but

395
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:17,519
they can often be a lot more effective

396
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,009
at training people for a job without the

397
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:22,169
usual hoop jumping that college degrees

398
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:24,480
usually require I know there are a lot

399
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,639
of folks who would argue that you can

400
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,600
learn very important things about

401
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,419
security knowing the difference but it's

402
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:32,519
entirely possible to learn to understand

403
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,649
ethics without knowing the difference

404
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:37,199
between kirkyard and cons but for a lot

405
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,759
of people college simply isn't

406
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:41,220
accessible this may change as more

407
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,049
colleges move online but it's unlikely

408
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,730
it will cease to be a huge financial

409
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,629
burden for people in some countries if

410
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:49,980
you do want to main retain degree

411
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,539
requirements you can help help offset

412
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:53,489
this burden by offering scholarships to

413
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:55,529
people looking into get looking to get

414
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:57,659
into computer security or talk to your

415
00:14:57,659 --> 00:14:58,709
local schools about what knowledge

416
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:01,199
graduates actually need to be useful to

417
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,569
your company because technical skill

418
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,549
requirements can be a pretty quickly

419
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:08,369
moving target it might be more effective

420
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:10,289
for colleges to focus on getting

421
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:12,269
students fluent in meta concepts of

422
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:14,339
computer security or computer science

423
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:17,850
and that way students could gain new

424
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,289
skills more quickly without having to

425
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:24,360
constantly update college coursework our

426
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,039
current system is set up to ensure a

427
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:28,529
huge number of false negatives people

428
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:29,850
are being pushed out of the pipeline at

429
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,190
every stage and we're failing to detect

430
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,020
huge number of people that would

431
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,900
otherwise be ideally suited more

432
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,730
experienced security practitioners are

433
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,560
the more likely they are to be what wary

434
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,570
of red flags that indicate a difficult

435
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,000
work environment what can we do to

436
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,830
counteract this don't expect the right

437
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,810
people to come to you there's a badly

438
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,130
worded phrase about doing the same thing

439
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,740
over and over again and yet we post our

440
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,240
job listings in the same place over and

441
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,010
over again and expect will magically

442
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,870
start getting more in diverse candidates

443
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,750
by going where the candidates are and by

444
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,550
making your company visible to diverse

445
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,590
communities you can find more diverse

446
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,930
applicants and while you're at it skip

447
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,940
the equal employment opportunity type of

448
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,640
legal boiler page if at all possible the

449
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,590
impression it gives is less we're a

450
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,540
diverse workforce and more we need to

451
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,130
find a token minority and that usually

452
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,690
means a really bad time for the token

453
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,500
minority yep if you ask 10 security

454
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,000
analysts what they do day to day you're

455
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,220
likely to get 11 different answers to

456
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,630
help clarify things we can start using

457
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,020
standardized job description terms the

458
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,850
National Institute for cybersecurity

459
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,160
education has come up with a workforce

460
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,380
framework that makes a common lexicon to

461
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,800
describe security work I so if you know

462
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,440
picking terms from those lists I think

463
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,820
we've all had the experience of looking

464
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,010
at a help-wanted ad for a security

465
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,180
position where it looks like someone

466
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,010
took every computer computer resounding

467
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:50,970
where they could think of and made a

468
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,390
list out of it I've looked at job ads

469
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,280
for patient positions that I've left and

470
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,260
I knew that the job didn't require half

471
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,420
of what they were calling mandatory and

472
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,970
that's a massive mishap of mismatch and

473
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,530
if they weren't doubling their salary

474
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,030
range they would be seriously

475
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,339
underpaying this person and lastly don't

476
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,990
forget that interview interviews are a

477
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,970
two-way street

478
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,619
you need to be showing candidates on

479
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,000
your company as much as they need to be

480
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,530
selling them their qualities to you it

481
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,520
can be helpful to think about what

482
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,770
you're ideally trying to do as finding

483
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,109
the amazing candidates that everyone

484
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,089
else is missing I can't think of anyone

485
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,470
who's more experienced at convincing

486
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,210
recalcitrant people to do things that

487
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,980
they don't necessarily want to do that

488
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,810
are good for them then parents of small

489
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,700
kids if you want to see how creative

490
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,860
someone can be at hacking technology to

491
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,960
figure out how false technology to see

492
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,250
how it falls short and how I can work

493
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,230
better for them talk to someone with

494
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,050
vision or hearing challenges

495
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,850
and people with learning disorders have

496
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,500
had to learn to do what they need to do

497
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,780
with a different set of tools than we're

498
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,420
all assumed to have we're all good at

499
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,860
what we do because of our life

500
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,990
experiences not despite them incredibly

501
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,360
talented smart and motivated people are

502
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,880
being turned away at a time where we are

503
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,440
desperately in need of lots of good

504
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,520
people so how do we make an ad that's

505
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,200
really enticing to a wide variety people

506
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,730
well we've probably all heard about ways

507
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,470
you're supposed to be able to reword ads

508
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,960
to make them more lady friendly I'm not

509
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,640
entirely convinced it'll change as they

510
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,830
suggest our gender specific as much as

511
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,510
they're about encouraging community and

512
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,280
cooperation rather than competition a

513
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,800
lot of our existing culture both in and

514
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,660
out of tech tends to value beating out

515
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,920
your competition rather than people

516
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,290
working together I think we have a bit

517
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,000
of an advantage in anti-malware as

518
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,560
there's already an understanding that

519
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,030
there's lots to be gained by putting our

520
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,550
heads together by including words in

521
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,960
your ad that focus on long term learning

522
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,790
and growth you're naturally going to

523
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,860
increase the variety of personalities

524
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,720
that will find it compelling tell

525
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,730
kenneth's how they can contribute to the

526
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,140
success of your business or make the

527
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:53,380
world a better place they can probably

528
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,730
that skip superlatives and extreme

529
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,470
modifiers someone doesn't actually have

530
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,910
to be the best reverse engineer in the

531
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,470
world they can probably be a just a good

532
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,390
one and get the job done and for a lot

533
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,190
less expensive

534
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,870
speaking of salaries start off with

535
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,210
telling your applicants your expected

536
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,340
salary range too many companies make

537
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,680
salary negotiate negotiations some sort

538
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,020
of ridiculous guessing game and then

539
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,250
they disqualify people with no

540
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,470
explanation or lowball them after

541
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,820
they've already put in a lot of effort

542
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,270
and use accessible text for example

543
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,040
black on a very light gray background is

544
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,140
best for readability non serif fonts are

545
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,480
more readable than serif left-aligned

546
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,820
text is better than justified use short

547
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,100
paragraphs avoid idioms that can confuse

548
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,690
people who aren't native speak of your

549
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,670
language and use bold text rather than

550
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,950
it outs for emphasis

551
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,630
make sure screen readers can read all of

552
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,710
your text especially if you're putting

553
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:46,610
in pictures I talked before about a

554
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,470
scenario where the crimes were way off

555
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,990
from what the job entailed assuming

556
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,730
you'd like to avoid that what should you

557
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,710
consider perhaps reconsider about your

558
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,960
job requirements let's go back to the

559
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,740
education

560
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,240
background I've talked before about how

561
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,160
requiring college degrees is not

562
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,140
necessarily a good indicator having a

563
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,490
bachelor's degree doesn't necessarily

564
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,840
mean someone's at a certain level of

565
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,760
intelligence or that they have a certain

566
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,410
amount of knowledge a work ethic or

567
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,020
skill it's wholly possible they could

568
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,150
have taught themselves to do what you

569
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,120
need them to do on their own and then

570
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,100
there's the whole X years of experience

571
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,600
with wide technology

572
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,610
is there something magical about that

573
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,080
specific number of years is there

574
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,179
another way you can express it that so

575
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:27,800
the people who master the technology in

576
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,020
X minus two years won't be turned off

577
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,970
how about experience with solving X

578
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,520
kinds of problems a lot of different

579
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,590
groups can be turned off by overinflated

580
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,090
requirements especially people who

581
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,250
actually have experience that can be a

582
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,770
very clear sign that jobs that the

583
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,530
companies have really unrealistic

584
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,590
expectations and will hold people to

585
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,950
unfortunate standards certifications can

586
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,630
be a good way to ensure that people have

587
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,940
a baseline of technical knowledge but if

588
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,440
someone only has 90% are you going to

589
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,750
disqualify them because of that some

590
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,330
companies are moving towards asking for

591
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,470
employees to commit to taking a

592
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,390
certification within a few months of

593
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,450
starting their job as a way to motivate

594
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,700
people to get that additional training

595
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,410
it can also be helpful positions where

596
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,420
other skills are more important than the

597
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,940
technical ones and if you're in an area

598
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,710
that's outside of the usual tech mecca's

599
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,980
it can really open your options to offer

600
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,520
remote work there have been quite a few

601
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,410
studies done in recent years about the

602
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,059
effects of remote working to see whether

603
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:30,260
it's actually hurting or helping

604
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,110
companies bottom lines and any of you

605
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,460
who've worked in an open-plan probably

606
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,590
be unsurprised to hear that people who

607
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,090
can choose their own working

608
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,770
arrangements are a lot more productive

609
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,059
and a lot more efficient

610
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:42,860
studies show that teleworking can allow

611
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,410
people to decrease the numbers and types

612
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,020
of distractions in their day it's and

613
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,820
it's not just employees that are self

614
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,870
recording this while they're actually

615
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,670
goofing off two-thirds of managers and

616
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,650
once there a survey reported

617
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,280
improvements in their reports as well

618
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,660
other studies say more than 80 percent

619
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,550
of remote workers reported reduced

620
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,590
stress 80 percent reported better morale

621
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,200
and almost 70 percent showed reduced

622
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,210
absenteeism so it should also be no

623
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,429
surprise that attrition also decreased

624
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,650
by half

625
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,760
naturally opening to the possibility of

626
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,140
remote work increases your range of

627
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,130
applicants since you're removing

628
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,500
geographic boundaries among other things

629
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,720
the thing to be aware of though is that

630
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,760
remote working can highlight deficits in

631
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,429
your existing communication if yours is

632
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:27,020
a group that tends towards everyone

633
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,030
keeping their head down in their own

634
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,100
work or having a lack of transparency or

635
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,480
ignoring people who don't toot their own

636
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,750
horn these things likely cause problems

637
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,880
that said these are not good things to

638
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,650
have and so it could allow you to find

639
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,240
these deficits and fix them so that when

640
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,049
they're so easy to see it's really

641
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:46,400
helpful to branch out where you're

642
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,690
posting your ads to reach a wider

643
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,000
variety people well you will reach a

644
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,980
smaller number of people on alternative

645
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,559
job boards it'll have much more impact

646
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,610
by showing up where people feel safe

647
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,080
it'll show that they're important the

648
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,179
presence is important to you and I hope

649
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:00,740
this is obvious but if you're asking

650
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,270
security conscious people to put their

651
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,750
data into sites that are not secure it's

652
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,039
generally bad luck if you use recruiters

653
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,600
to find qualified applicants choose ones

654
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,740
who can prove they have a track record

655
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,140
of finding diverse talent or ask your

656
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,309
existing recruiters to start tracking

657
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:18,530
data so that you can start providing

658
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,630
data so you can track it you can also

659
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,419
tap networks of your existing plays by

660
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:25,220
giving hiring BOCES bonuses to people

661
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,500
who give recommendations especially for

662
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,400
diverse talent once you've gone through

663
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,720
your stack of resumes and started doing

664
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,280
interviews there's a whole new set of

665
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,590
things to consider we've probably all

666
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,179
heard horror stories about bad

667
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:40,460
interviews which is to say or it gets

668
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,720
around if your company is being

669
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,030
inconsiderate to candidates it's

670
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,590
important to remember interviewees have

671
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,299
lies and maybe an existing job that they

672
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:49,640
need to attend to don't put undue

673
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,230
burdens in terms of either the number or

674
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:57,740
the lengths of interviews if you do an

675
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,330
in-person interview find a calm and

676
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,100
quiet interview site there's a been a

677
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,750
trend of going to war in formal places

678
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,789
to decrease the pressure on candidates

679
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:06,620
but team interviews that involve

680
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,570
drinking in bars or even just busy

681
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,919
coffee shops are really not a great

682
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,500
place for being able to hear people

683
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,880
decreasing pressure on applicants is

684
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,470
always a good idea but don't shoot your

685
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,370
shell itself in the foot in other ways

686
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,049
some companies use in-home tests or

687
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:23,000
quick in office projects to get a more

688
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,080
realistic sense of how

689
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,730
people work with others or how they do

690
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,159
their job done well this can be a really

691
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,480
great way to see people in their natural

692
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,360
element but this isn't an opportunity to

693
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,850
score free labor more keep requests

694
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,260
brief they shouldn't take more than a

695
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,690
few minutes to an hour especially with

696
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,309
people who are new to the industry or

697
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:41,870
maybe younger they may not have a lot of

698
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,820
experience with business travel or tight

699
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,320
finances might cause someone to drop out

700
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,940
if they think you're expecting them to

701
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,350
drop a lot of cash to travel to a

702
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,659
faraway place I'll let people know in

703
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:52,700
advance what expenses you'll cover like

704
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,350
parking gas flights hotel that sort of

705
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,240
thing err on the side of not making them

706
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,500
pay upfront make sure you're giving all

707
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,360
your applicants and even chance it's a

708
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,039
good idea to have a panel of interested

709
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,389
parties come up with a list of interview

710
00:25:05,389 --> 00:25:07,610
questions in advance that way you're

711
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,769
comparing apples to apples take notes

712
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:11,720
while you're reviewing and grade them on

713
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,360
predetermined criteria then review your

714
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,440
impressions shortly after each of

715
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,179
interview and if you're having multiple

716
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:19,159
do people do the interview include as

717
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:21,950
diverse a group as you can to get a wide

718
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,679
variety of opinions when you're creating

719
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:26,269
questions or grading your applicants be

720
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:28,190
sure to stick to job tasks and qualities

721
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,049
that actually pertain to what they need

722
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:32,240
to be able to do for example people who

723
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,590
work with code or sell them known for

724
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,830
their fancy dress habits and personal

725
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,049
charisma is not usually a necessity of

726
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:41,389
malware analysis of course that won't be

727
00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:43,549
the case if it's a single job and please

728
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:44,720
don't ask people to answer trivia

729
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,460
questions or come up with obscure facts

730
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,990
that they won't actually need to be able

731
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,460
to do their job and they would just

732
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,360
search for Google if they had to once

733
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,559
you've hired somebody you want to get

734
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,870
the best out of them security is a brain

735
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,429
intensive task which means people will

736
00:25:58,429 --> 00:26:00,440
need quiet time and space to do their

737
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,110
job open-plan offices and meetings that

738
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,149
could be an email or the bane of our

739
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:07,340
existence based in many of us got into

740
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,230
security is because it offers learning

741
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,179
opportunities if we don't continue to

742
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:13,039
learn we become less effective over time

743
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,230
make sure your reach researchers have

744
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,000
time and funding to go to workshops

745
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,250
conferences or community events to keep

746
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,740
their brains fresh having enough time to

747
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,240
do projects that actually fix problems

748
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,559
rather than just slapping a bandaid on

749
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,350
it is very good for a mental health it's

750
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,330
also important to establish

751
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,830
psychological safety so employees feel

752
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,929
safe taking moderate risks that means

753
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:34,700
being able to speak their mind without

754
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,170
fear of their getting their heads

755
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,900
been off or being ignored there are a

756
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,180
few things is wasteful and frustrating

757
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,620
is hiring security people and then

758
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,110
disregarding their ideas and yet we all

759
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,270
know how often this happens if you're

760
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,740
hiring someone to do security trust

761
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,840
their opinions work with them to

762
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,130
understand the business case for what

763
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,050
they're wanting have sponsors both for

764
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,460
individuals and for the security group

765
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,500
in general having someone who can speak

766
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,090
up for people when they're not in the

767
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,620
room can do a lot for morale and

768
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,930
longevity the things to remember for

769
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,370
bringing new people are sort of a repeat

770
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,750
of all the things we talked about before

771
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,910
have a good code of conduct make sure

772
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,350
people know it and understand it and

773
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,390
enforce it when things go wrong be clear

774
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,890
and explicit about performance goals

775
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,470
from the outset use the buddy system so

776
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,790
that people have someone who already

777
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,530
knows the ropes who can help them get

778
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,600
established to feel supported check in

779
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,100
frequently to make sure that they're

780
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,840
getting settled in ok and help them find

781
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,010
the right resources if they're having

782
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:35,370
problems so here's a few wall of text I

783

here's a few resources the first few are

784
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,120
about helping kids learn about coding

785
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,710
the project include has a lot of

786
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,750
