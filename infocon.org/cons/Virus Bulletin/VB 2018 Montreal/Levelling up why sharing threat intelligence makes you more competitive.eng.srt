1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,610
good afternoon everyone my name is Jenna

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,110
and I'm gonna be your chair for the next

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,210
two sessions and you're really in for a

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,460
delight I'm really happy to introduce

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,590
and I'm actually quite privileged to

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,450
introduce this speaker I've been working

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,160
with him for a while on the effort he's

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,949
going to talk about Michael Daniel he is

9
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,529
the president and CEO of the cyber

10
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:22,500
threat Alliance prior to that assignment

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,710
he was special assistant President Obama

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,640
in the US and cybersecurity coordinator

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,199
on the National Security Council so he's

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,510
had some prestigious jobs and he's here

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,760
today to talk about leveling up why

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,620
sharing threat intelligence actually

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,770
makes you more competitive alright thank

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,100
you

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,230
Thank You Jeanette and thanks everyone

20
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,140
for thanks to the virus books and folks

21
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,780
for inviting me to speak and for all of

22
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,449
you for coming today so I'm going to

23
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,110
jump right in to this question because

24
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,360
all of you have been talking about this

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,160
information for this thing called

26
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,620
information sharing for 20 years right

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,500
and arguably the industry as a whole has

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,200
been doing a pretty poor job of it and

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,540
you hurt you've heard if some of you

30
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,369
were in the threat intelligence sharing

31
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,340
sequence where Adam Meyers from

32
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,479
CrowdStrike was talking about it and the

33
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,040
previous speaker was just talking some

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,560
about all of the issues around this

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,770
there are actually plenty of reasons why

36
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,390
but I'm here to talk to you about how

37
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,759
actually sharing intelligence can in

38
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,439
fact make you more competitive and why

39
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,229
the environment today makes that makes

40
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,860
that so so the first thing is that we

41
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,810
actually have to disaggregate some of

42
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,990
what we're talking about because a lot

43
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,570
of times we lump information sharing all

44
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,780
together and we act like all information

45
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,619
is the same and moreover we actually act

46
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,290
like every organization in the entire

47
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,909
world should be sharing all of these

48
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,680
different kinds of information with each

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,350
other all of the time which is

50
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,240
completely wrong

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,259
most 99.9% of the organizations on the

52
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,299
planet would not know what to do with a

53
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,250
technical indicator if you handed it to

54
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,489
them in bulk they would not know what to

55
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:12,569
do with it on their networks they

56
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,350
wouldn't know how to get it

57
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,630
out of their networks and why we expect

58
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,610
them and why we keep acting like they

59
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,440
should be able to do something with it

60
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,400
is actually kind of mystified because

61
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,900
most of them are never going to be very

62
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,980
good at it

63
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,930
and so when we start talking about

64
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,520
information sharing the first thing we

65
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,840
actually have to do is talk about what

66
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,340
kind of information are we talking about

67
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,950
it we time out the technical data that

68
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,010
your companies are very good at

69
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,170
understanding and sharing are we talking

70
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,140
about attribution who did it are we

71
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,150
talking about this is what you knew need

72
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,180
to do to actually deal with the problem

73
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,380
this is what you need to do that's

74
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,970
defensive measures this is what you need

75
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,370
to do to actually stop you know prevent

76
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,750
yourself from having a problem in the

77
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,520
first place

78
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,100
is it strategic warning these kinds of

79
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,170
bad guys are doing these kinds of things

80
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,170
in this industry what I consider to be

81
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,360
tactical warning this bad guy is

82
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,530
targeting your company today situational

83
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,780
awareness what's the telemetry show how

84
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,600
widespread is wanna cry or not pet SIA

85
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,180
or VP and filter those are all very

86
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,340
different kinds of information and when

87
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,370
we set up our information sharing

88
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,720
organizations we need to take this into

89
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,540
account and I would submit to you that

90
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,520
we actually should be expecting the

91
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,220
cyber security vendor industry to be

92
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,740
sharing those top two things technical

93
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,140
data and context and maybe the last

94
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,070
thing situational awareness we should be

95
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,290
expecting as society's we should expect

96
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,850
the industry to share that amongst

97
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,640
itself and then use that to protect

98
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,980
everybody else and we should stop

99
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,780
expecting everybody else to share that

100
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,680
kind of information so when you actually

101
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,480
think about the things that hinder us

102
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,060
from doing that in in the industry

103
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,250
there's really kind of four things that

104
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:08,100
actually in my view stop us one is you

105
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,710
know technical problems actually how do

106
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,810
you have an accepted standard for how

107
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,120
you share information even at the

108
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,130
technical level even when you drill down

109
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,149
into something like styx format you

110
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,440
actually discover that everybody's

111
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,150
implementation of sticks is slightly

112
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,240
different right so

113
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,560
actually doing the interchange and

114
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,270
making sure that what one company calls

115
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,830
something is the same that another

116
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,000
company calls something is actually

117
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,880
quite challenging there's legal issues

118
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,800
whether you're talking about antitrust

119
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,729
problems privacy issues liability issues

120
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:44,610
they sort of plague the legal constructs

121
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,889
or to plague the industry there's the

122
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,090
issue of the business model right how do

123
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,410
you actually make money off of this

124
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,440
because it actually has to support what

125
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,970
you're doing there has to be a return on

126
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,289
investment it has to support your

127
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:00,060
business model and then there's just the

128
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,819
plain old cultural factors the shouldn't

129
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:04,560
I really know more than anybody else and

130
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,250
that's how I am awesome right the the

131
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,599
demonstration of your awesomeness in the

132
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:12,569
industry is how much you know so all of

133
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:15,180
these factors combine to make it very

134
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,699
difficult for companies to share but my

135
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,699
argument is that in fact actually what

136
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,099
we have discovered through building the

137
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:29,699
cyber threat Alliance is that sharing

138
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,389
actually improves your competitive edge

139
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:36,690
and we have through building CTA figured

140
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,289
out ways to actually address all four of

141
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:41,969
these issues although I won't claim that

142
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:43,320
what we're doing is a hundred percent

143
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,320
perfect because we're still learning but

144
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,090
what we've done is we've actually built

145
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,610
a model that I think that I think works

146
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,070
and it actually starts to get at these

147
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,039
questions of why does threat sharing

148
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,039
enhance your competitive edge

149
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:00,419
first of all cyber security is not just

150
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:04,319
a technical problem yes it is a

151
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,909
technical problem but it's much more

152
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:09,050
than that it's also an economic problem

153
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,389
it's a business problem it's a national

154
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:13,979
security problem it's a political

155
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,990
problem Jeanette's gonna talk about fake

156
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,400
news in just a minute you know in the

157
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,099
next session political problem right not

158
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:23,490
just a technical problem there is no way

159
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,900
that any one company can possibly have

160
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,479
all of the expertise to deal with all of

161
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,099
the different things that makes up

162
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:36,210
cybersecurity it's just not possible the

163
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,270
the ability to actually array the kind

164
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,650
of expertise that you need

165
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,540
to address the full scope of threats

166
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,310
that we now face in cyberspace means

167
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,340
that you must be working together and it

168
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,199
doesn't blunt your competitive edge if

169
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,810
you're actually working with a company

170
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,460
that brings a comparative advantage in

171
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,699
another area to the table it's in fact

172
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,800
it enhances it because it means that you

173
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,990
actually get a boost from what the other

174
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,949
people are doing second I would argue

175
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,080
that the cybersecurity benefits come

176
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,389
from actually taking action ultimately

177
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,760
the information that we share needs to

178
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,010
be actionable in some way if we are

179
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,190
sharing information with an end user we

180
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,889
want them to do something right at the

181
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:25,080
end of the day we either want to put the

182
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,830
information into a firewall we want to

183
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,720
put it into a detection system we want

184
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,360
to use it for research we want to be

185
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,010
able to identify the bad guy we want to

186
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,910
disrupt the bad guy it it may not be

187
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,860
immediate in other words I'm not saying

188
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,389
that you want to necessarily take action

189
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:44,220
right away because sometimes you

190
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,570
actually want to watch what the bad guys

191
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,650
do I spent I spent 11 years working with

192
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,570
the US intelligence community sometimes

193
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,720
you want to just watch and wait but at

194
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,360
some point you want to take action and

195
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,120
so in those cases ultimately at the end

196
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,889
of the day right it's not what you know

197
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,490
it's what you do with what you know and

198
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,849
the competitive advantage comes not from

199
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:12,690
this mass of indicators but it's what

200
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,240
you do with the indicators at some level

201
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,860
some of the argument we've been having

202
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,169
it's like we've been saying you should

203
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:21,510
buy my stuff because my inadequate pool

204
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,729
of data is bigger than that person is

205
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:26,940
inadequate pool of data that makes no

206
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,150
sense and so instead that the

207
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,500
competition needs to occur on what you

208
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,750
do with the data my analysis is better

209
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,520
my customer service is better i'm

210
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,640
cuddlier whatever the whatever the

211
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,549
ultimate competitive advantage is but

212
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:44,580
it's not just on the raw data and then

213
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,339
lastly we all know that what we've been

214
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,459
doing hasn't worked the threat out there

215
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:53,980
is continuing to get worse not better

216
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,150
the bad guys are continuing to

217
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,070
proliferate they're continuing to

218
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,600
discover that what you can do in

219
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,440
cyberspace is paying off the bad guys

220
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,000
have a fabulous business model right now

221
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,370
if you're a criminal

222
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,540
fifty sixty thousand lines a really

223
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,190
crappy code you know you can make a

224
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,290
bazillion dollars that way it seems like

225
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,029
nation-states have all discovered that

226
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:15,380
they can pursue their interests through

227
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,190
cyberspace so what we're doing to

228
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,160
actually undermine the bad guys business

229
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,279
model is not working so in order to

230
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,620
actually do that we have to figure out

231
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,330
ways to disrupt the adversary

232
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,450
systematically from beginning to end and

233
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:35,480
not just you know disrupt their botnet

234
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,870
for two hours but actually fundamentally

235
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,940
start to undermine their entire business

236
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,550
model I want to make them start to do

237
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,290
business process reengineering

238
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,550
on a regular basis but to do that we

239
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,680
actually have to share data across a

240
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,300
whole bunch of different organizations

241
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,490
in order to assemble the kinds of

242
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,320
products and outputs that we want that

243
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,350
actually give you the full picture for

244
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,000
example of the playbook that the

245
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,820
adversary is going to run we actually

246
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,770
have to cooperate and collaborate or

247
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,510
we'll never actually be able to assemble

248
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:13,220
that full view of the adversary so that

249
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,900
we can actually then collaborate

250
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,380
together to disrupt with the adversary

251
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:24,080
what the adversary is doing so within so

252
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,250
I'll show you one thing that was on a

253
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,660
different slide so these original

254
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,220
founding charter members that you see

255
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,750
there came together to actually create

256
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,610
the cyber threat Alliance to do exactly

257
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,980
what I was just talking about as of

258
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,990
yesterday we actually announced four new

259
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,390
members of the cyber threat Alliance so

260
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:47,200
alienvault last mine NEC and Drago's

261
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,850
actually just officially became members

262
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,790
yesterday so we are now up to 20

263
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,770
companies but the model that we've built

264
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:00,110
is one where we address a couple of the

265
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,580
issues that we're talking about one we

266
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,890
built a technical platform that enables

267
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,769
our member companies to share data

268
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:09,199
speed at scale and we're continuing to

269
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:14,199
evolve that as we learn we actually have

270
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:18,860
a sharing requirement so if you're going

271
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,689
to be a part of the cyber threat

272
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:22,149
Alliance you have to share

273
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:26,540
so no freeloading in there you actually

274
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,040
have to meet a certain threshold of

275
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,040
sharing on a daily basis

276
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,689
there's also transparency everybody in

277
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:35,989
the Alliance can see who shared what in

278
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:37,279
fact everybody can see exactly who

279
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,379
shared what I'm out if you don't think

280
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:40,999
that CEOs don't pay attention to where

281
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:45,279
they fall on the sharing list yeah

282
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,790
the we've addressed the the transparency

283
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,079
issues and we've also addressed the

284
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:52,790
issues of what are people going to do

285
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,129
with the data it's very upfront if when

286
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:57,040
the data that is shared with us is

287
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,389
intended to be used by the members to

288
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:00,739
actually improve their products and

289
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:02,779
services so we're very upfront about

290
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:04,910
that we're also very upfront about who

291
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,889
can join the alliance the the rule set

292
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:12,619
for us is a objective set of rules so

293
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:15,079
that we can so that we can comply with

294
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:18,529
US antitrust and frankly EU antitrust

295
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:24,170
regulations so within this I want to

296
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,970
give you three examples of how the

297
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,839
sharing that CTA has done has actually

298
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,199
benefited all of our all of our members

299
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:37,220
so one was on wanna cry I mean the wanna

300
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,399
cry outbreak happened we very rapidly

301
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,480
convened all of the members in fact it

302
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,509
was that I was in Israel at the time for

303
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:53,809
Israel cyber week and when we convened

304
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:56,480
all of the when we convened all of the

305
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,189
members what we were able to do very

306
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:03,290
quickly was to eliminate some of the fog

307
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,049
that had accumulated around what was

308
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:08,839
going on at that point it was so early

309
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:10,100
that everybody was still running around

310
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,309
looking for the email phishing attack

311
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:18,490
that was driving wanna cry and

312
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:20,869
what all of our members collectively as

313
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:22,699
we started going around the virtual

314
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:25,369
table was not a single one of our

315
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:27,800
members at the time we had 12 not a

316
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,930
single one of our 12 members had seen a

317
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,819
single email that could be associated

318
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:36,619
with wanna cry now the like any one of

319
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:38,059
our members was sort of saying well

320
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:40,069
maybe we just didn't see it because we

321
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,589
know that we don't see everything but

322
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,779
when all 12 of the members were arriving

323
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:48,050
at the same conclusion that helped very

324
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,300
quickly eliminate a lot of the fog that

325
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,980
was going on and allowed us to in fact

326
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,209
actually go to several governments who

327
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:55,069
are we just about to publish some

328
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:56,600
information about looking for the

329
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,269
phishing email to say probably shouldn't

330
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:02,079
do that you'll look a little foolish and

331
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,040
to their credit they actually listened

332
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,009
to us and didn't and we probably got

333
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:11,209
about a 24 to 48 hour on what was

334
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:13,189
otherwise where what it would have

335
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:15,050
otherwise taken our members to to get

336
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,709
there so that's one example the second

337
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:21,619
example is VPN filter so this is

338
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:24,290
actually very interesting because Cisco

339
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,420
talis had been doing a lot of research

340
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,410
on the VPN filter malware set and it's a

341
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,929
particularly fascinating piece of

342
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:34,879
malware if you're a cyber nerd like me

343
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:37,279
right you know but it's particularly

344
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,370
nasty because it has a destructive set

345
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:44,749
and so cisco had become concerned the

346
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:46,519
level of infection rate was starting to

347
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,550
spike and so we knew that it was getting

348
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,110
close to time to actually go public with

349
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,999
the findings but cisco did something

350
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:55,610
very interesting which was they came to

351
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,410
the alliance and they said we will brief

352
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,990
all of the alliance members a few days

353
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,999
in advance of going live with our

354
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:04,249
findings and we will share the technical

355
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:06,199
data and ensure that it's in the

356
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:08,360
platform a few days before going live

357
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,149
with our findings and this did a couple

358
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:13,429
of things we were actually able to then

359
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:15,259
have all of our members ready to go

360
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:19,189
as ready as they could be with putting

361
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:20,990
the protections into their systems in

362
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,019
place as well as they could obviously

363
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:25,220
mostly it was detections because all

364
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,809
this stuff was on routers that are very

365
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:29,420
hard to actually protect but the

366
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,829
detections into place they could have

367
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,480
their blog's ready to go

368
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,230
and the result was that when Cisco went

369
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,660
live with their findings they didn't

370
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,820
just have themselves going out there

371
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,240
they had almost all of the CTA members

372
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,680
virtually simultaneously supporting them

373
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,630
and what they did they got a lot of

374
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,339
credit

375
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:50,779
they got identified as the source of

376
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:52,699
this from the other CTA members but they

377
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:55,459
got a much bigger lift of publicity and

378
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:57,589
identification for what they did the

379
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,630
other members were able to instead of

380
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,490
fielding those irate phone calls from

381
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,649
the CEO of like rotten Reno about this

382
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:05,750
they were able to say yes we knew about

383
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,880
this and we're ready they could field

384
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,680
those phone calls from customers and say

385
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,320
yes we're already working on that we

386
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,360
also managed to coordinate this activity

387
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,480
with the US government so 30 minutes

388
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,480
before Cisco released its findings

389
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,940
publicly the US Justice Department and

390
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,820
the FBI took legal action against many

391
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,800
of the domains that the second stage of

392
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,709
the malware was calling out to and so we

393
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:32,600
were able to boost the impact even

394
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,600
further by that level of collaboration

395
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,750
and coordination and then the last

396
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,529
example is simply that the automated

397
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:44,569
sharing that we do on a daily basis

398
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:46,100
every single one of our members is they

399
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,990
have delved into it have realized that

400
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,880
they're learning something new they're

401
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,639
seeing something on a daily basis that

402
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,050
they otherwise wouldn't get it varies in

403
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,819
percentage and it varies and exactly

404
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:01,670
what that data is depending on their

405
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,380
business model and their scope but every

406
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,449
single one of our members get something

407
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:07,549
that they otherwise wouldn't get because

408
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:11,059
they're members of CTA and this enables

409
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:14,000
them to boost the value of their

410
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,819
products and services because they are

411
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:19,520
CTA members so those are just three

412
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,079
examples of how sharing within the cyber

413
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,150
threat Alliance has made our member

414
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,280
companies more competitive more

415
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,929
effective at what they've done okay so

416
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:34,940
we start sharing in CTA so where are we

417
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,030
going so now what so a lot of what we're

418
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,919
trying to do now is build up the sharing

419
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,929
organizations because is my contention

420
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:46,370
as I said that the we need to focus the

421
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,460
nickel sharing efforts that the

422
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,380
technical indicators the context the

423
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,940
situational awareness we need to focus

424
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,410
that on the technically competent

425
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:58,220
entities and enable that robust sharing

426
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,780
to occur in the background in a way

427
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,540
that's completely transparent to 98% of

428
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,300
the users on the planet we need to

429
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,710
actually start to enable more robust

430
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,140
sharing between sectors we're starting

431
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,180
to really see the reuse of tools right

432
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,920
we're seeing this the reuse of tools

433
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,660
between nation-states and criminals but

434
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,980
we're also starting to see them bleeding

435
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,740
over into different sectors we're seeing

436
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,860
them do things we're seeing them pivot

437
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,110
when they get into a when they get into

438
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,030
a network they start doing an assessment

439
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,760
is there useful IP that I can steal nope

440
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,640
okay is there useful PII I can steal no

441
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,170
not really okay fine I'll do some

442
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,730
illicit crypto mining while I'm here and

443
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,080
steal a bunch of cycles from these

444
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,720
people we're starting to see that kind

445
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,050
of that kind of activity and so we need

446
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,920
to enable that robust sharing between

447
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,429
sectors in order to improve what we

448
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:50,840
improve what we're doing and then

449
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,610
finally we need to continue to figure

450
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,440
out ways to translate this sharing into

451
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,110
action how do we actually start to

452
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,690
really create those outputs that do that

453
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,940
systemic disruption that I was talking

454
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,309
about earlier so that we actually knock

455
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,020
the adversary back on their heels not

456
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,770
for a couple of hours but for days weeks

457
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,890
months force them to expend a lot more

458
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:17,090
resources to achieve their goals and we

459
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,559
need to use this shared data to identify

460
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,270
the specific actions that different

461
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,910
parts of the ecosystem can take what all

462
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,440
of them remember what all of our member

463
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,450
companies can do with net companies here

464
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,070
can do is different than what the telcos

465
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,050
can do it's different than what

466
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,150
governments can do it's different than

467
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,230
what the critical infrastructure

468
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,750
verticals can do and we need to start

469
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,550
working that out and using our shared

470
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:40,130
data and shared situational awareness to

471
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,429
enable that so those are the key lessons

472
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:47,240
that I wanted to that I wanted to lay

473
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,270
down for you so at this point I'll open

474
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,710
it up to questions
