1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,550
okay if you could please take your seats

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,589
and quieten down just a little you

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:08,880
probably don't need to quieten down much

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,000
because like me our next speaker has a

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,980
large voice and he's not afraid of using

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,730
it

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,740
I've enjoyed many of stiffens

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,270
presentations in the past and I'm

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,460
looking forward to hearing what he's got

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,070
to say this afternoon thank you very

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,260
much

12
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,849
hello everybody thank you for joining

13
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,699
this presentation it's not going to be a

14
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,500
technical talk unlike the other talks

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,059
most of the other talks here at virus

16
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,800
bulletin but I think this is a

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,800
discussion that we as an industry need

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,690
to have so I'm going to tell you a story

19
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,030
about freedom essentially today because

20
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,340
freedom is something that I care about

21
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,469
very deeply but before we start I want

22
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,840
to tell you that when I was a teenager

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,520
and I was reading George Orwell's 1994 I

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,030
was surprised and I was intrigued I was

25
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,280
intrigued to see this dystopian future

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,460
in which every citizen was monitored by

27
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,830
their government through these

28
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,750
telescreens which were essentially

29
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,909
fictional devices somewhere in between

30
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,330
TV sets and security cameras and the

31
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,100
thing was it was mandatory for every

32
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,040
citizen to have such a telescreen in

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,409
their living rooms now when I look

34
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,780
around the world we live in nowadays I

35
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,030
don't see much of a difference we

36
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,180
surround ourselves with Smart TVs smart

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,340
devices internet of things that have

38
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,140
microphones that have cameras that have

39
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,430
full connections to the Internet the

40
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,350
only difference being that we are the

41
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,930
ones to buy these devices and we install

42
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,500
them in our living rooms ourselves so

43
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,270
this is going to be a talk about

44
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,570
balkanization in the digital age but

45
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,939
before we talk about that I'd like to

46
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,360
take you a little bit back into the past

47
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,009
and I'd like to ask you to imagine a

48
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,770
world without borders a world in which

49
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,500
human civilization was able to evolve

50
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,229
because of one main reason which was

51
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,430
migration

52
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,049
this was a world in which the famous

53
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:15,760
Silk Road which was a trading route

54
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,390
connecting three continents from Asia to

55
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,049
to Europe and civilizations among this

56
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:26,469
trading route were able to evolve not

57
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:27,700
just because they were able to exchange

58
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,700
goods and merchant merchandise but also

59
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,189
because they were able to exchange ideas

60
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:35,950
and philosophies about you know things

61
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,090
such as religion life or for science so

62
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,519
support was this thing that opened long

63
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:44,439
distance economic and political

64
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,689
relationships between all of these

65
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:49,919
civilizations and the same principles

66
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,750
stood at the core of the Internet when

67
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,720
the internet was invented you know it

68
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,180
was just a small project from

69
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,579
universities university researchers that

70
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:02,919
wanted to better share their information

71
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:06,669
together you know freely and in a family

72
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:08,019
matter to essentially try to take

73
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:10,450
science to the next level so back then

74
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,739
of course it was a very small project

75
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:14,079
they all knew each other and they all

76
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:17,470
trusted each other so this is why things

77
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,780
such as privacy or security were not

78
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,329
really implemented back then and we're

79
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,250
trying to implement them now to add them

80
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,739
now on top of an already shaky

81
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,720
foundation so the same this is why the

82
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,879
Internet is inherently insecure and this

83
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,620
is why we're here and I think it's a

84
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,540
good thing that smart points like the

85
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,310
ones in the room are trying to tackle

86
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,599
these problems now Tim berners-lee the

87
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:43,299
inventor of the world wide web had this

88
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:45,639
famous quote that he hopes we will use

89
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,519
the net to cross barriers and to connect

90
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,579
cultures and I don't know about yourself

91
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:54,699
but when I came here to Montreal I had

92
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:57,009
to pass through three different passport

93
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:59,939
controls and security checks in airports

94
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,979
so nowadays I'm thinking that we live in

95
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:04,840
a world in which borders are everywhere

96
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,540
borders are ubiquitous and we not only

97
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,759
take these borders for granted but we

98
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,379
got used with them and we don't seem to

99
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:13,479
have a problem with them the thing is

100
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,989
that worlds and borders usually promote

101
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,370
segregation they have a negative impact

102
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,159
on economy creativity technology and

103
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:23,740
they generally slow down progress on

104
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,920
every level

105
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,070
and the thing is while we all understand

106
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,450
the benefits of you know global

107
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,480
information sharing and collaboration we

108
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,990
as a society we haven't reached that

109
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,960
level of maturity in which we can quit

110
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,360
having borders in which can we can take

111
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,870
tear down both physicals and and virtual

112
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,150
borders so this is the world that we

113
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,040
live in nowadays but what gives me hope

114
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,470
is that sometimes we like to jump over

115
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,750
some walls sometimes we even like to

116
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,790
tear these walls down and I think the

117
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,100
Berlin Wall is a great example of what

118
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,290
human beings can do when they really

119
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,960
want to become free the thing is that

120
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,780
right now less than three decades after

121
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,690
the Berlin Wall fell and essentially put

122
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,430
an end to an era of division between the

123
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,370
East and the West I think that we're on

124
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,960
the verge of making the same mistakes

125
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,210
all over again only this time we're

126
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,310
making these mistakes in in the cyber

127
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,810
space so balkanization is something that

128
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,210
keeps me up at night and for those of

129
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,620
you who are not necessarily familiar

130
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,720
with the term I have to admit I wasn't

131
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,160
familiar with the term until a few years

132
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,490
ago myself balkanization is essentially

133
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,590
a geopolitical term defining the

134
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,960
situation in which an area is becoming

135
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,570
more and more divided into smaller parts

136
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,820
smaller entities and these smaller

137
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,210
entities not only they are uncooperative

138
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,160
with each other they might actually

139
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,110
become hostile to each other like

140
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,140
actively trying to to attack each other

141
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,410
so the thing is the internet definitely

142
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,530
has this natural tendency to be divided

143
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,390
and I think that this is because of

144
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,640
differences that we have in things such

145
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,280
as culture or language right so for

146
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,050
example we all live in a part of the

147
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,610
world in which we browse what I like to

148
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,320
call the english-speaking internet right

149
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,120
when we google some when we search for

150
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,370
something on the internet we google it

151
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,950
but if we're talking about the Chinese

152
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,450
speaking person they will probably not

153
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,980
use you Google they'll probably use

154
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,990
Baidu or a russian-speaking person they

155
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,420
will not use Google they will use Yandex

156
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,700
and I think that this division is okay

157
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,540
as long as it's 100% natural and as long

158
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,760
as we're not trying to artificially you

159
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,749
know raise walls

160
00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:39,919
basically put a stop to the free flow of

161
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,080
of information because the thing is

162
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,879
information is like water it has a

163
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,159
tendency to leak it has a tendency to

164
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,379
get to places where it shouldn't just

165
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,449
like you know to communicating vessels

166
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,249
will get filled by the same source of

167
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:56,159
water the same way information will

168
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,919
manage to reach and disseminate

169
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,569
throughout all the parts of the all the

170
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:04,079
parts of the world so unfortunately I

171
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,989
think not everyone is okay with the

172
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:09,929
current status quo I mean if we look

173
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,399
around I think more and more countries

174
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:15,149
are right now building walls on the

175
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:18,329
Internet and I think that the Great

176
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:20,479
Firewall of China is a very good example

177
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,909
to illustrate this thing if we look at

178
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:25,319
the history the internet entered China

179
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,129
in 1994 and the Communist Party back

180
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:31,739
then was very quick to realize that this

181
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:33,539
new network has the power has the

182
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,849
potential of bringing like-minded

183
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:37,829
individuals together which could really

184
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:40,110
pose a threat to the government so as

185
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,199
quickly as 1997 the Great Firewall of

186
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,119
China its first version was actually up

187
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:47,669
and running operational monitoring

188
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:49,579
internet traffic and blocking access to

189
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:53,429
to certain to certain websites so yeah

190
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:55,469
that's right the Internet in China free

191
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:58,349
internet in China only lasted for no

192
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:01,469
more than no more than three years so

193
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:03,569
this means that you know back then if

194
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:06,869
you google pictures of the Tiananmen

195
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:08,550
Square from the Chinese internet you

196
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,379
would only see pictures of a clear blue

197
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:14,729
sky and some nice Asian architecture if

198
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,409
you google the same thing from anywhere

199
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:17,610
else in the world you will see the

200
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,069
famous tank man picture would be came on

201
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:22,289
you know an iconic symbol of the

202
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:24,719
revolution iconic symbol of courage over

203
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:27,749
the world and by the way I hear that

204
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:30,599
google is going back to China right now

205
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,089
so the thing is this is not a Chinese

206
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:36,058
only problem this is actually China set

207
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:37,558
the trend in motion it was the first

208
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,750
domino to put this this trend in motion

209
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,789
and right now if you look around the

210
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,889
world there's a huge technical industry

211
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:47,160
that's fueling the growth of internet

212
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,279
surveillance let's you

213
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,399
things such as censorship and generally

214
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,749
the division of the the internet and

215
00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:56,860
there's a private industry that

216
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,800
unfortunately is thriving on this every

217
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,269
year more and more companies are being

218
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:03,370
started up and their only purpose is to

219
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,410
try to find new ways to which they can

220
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,509
you know attack our computers or through

221
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:09,879
which they can get access to to our

222
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,740
information I'm sure that all of you

223
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,379
here are very aware of this because of

224
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,480
the research that gets published in in

225
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,389
our industry and the thing that you know

226
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:20,860
the thing that I don't really like is

227
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,660
that usually these companies are based

228
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,910
in the green parts of the world while

229
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,610
their victims are based in the red parts

230
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,430
of the world and of course I understand

231
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,959
it you know like money makes the world

232
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:34,180
go round so without any kind of export

233
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,610
restrictions or restrictions to

234
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,529
surveillance technologies they will sell

235
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:41,050
these technologies to the higher bidder

236
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,899
and I think this there's nothing that we

237
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:45,759
can do about it or maybe there is where

238
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,529
there's definitely a discussion that

239
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:49,629
it's worth having who were the yellow

240
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:54,910
countries that I do probably

241
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,230
so what happens when a certain

242
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,490
government cannot or doesn't want to get

243
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,890
the information directly by themselves

244
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,080
well they can legally compel Internet

245
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,450
companies to share this data that they

246
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,020
have available for for the customers and

247
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,140
the thing is in the past few years if

248
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,280
you look at for example silicon

249
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,110
valley-based based companies they seem

250
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,670
to be very willing to cooperate and to

251
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,050
agree essentially with these requests

252
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,090
for information for personal information

253
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,220
or with these takedown requests or

254
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,780
censorship requests right so refusing to

255
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,610
comply with such requests usually means

256
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,050
that that company is not going to do

257
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,760
business anymore in that specific

258
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,260
country so maybe the Chinese example is

259
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,940
not something that will touch you maybe

260
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,530
the Chinese example is not something

261
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,150
that's that's very close to you because

262
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,980
you know China is very far away and we

263
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,660
don't really care about what's happening

264
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,180
there but I'd like you to travel to a

265
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,840
place closer to home to my home at least

266
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,280
which is Turkey I mean my home is

267
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,630
Romania what Turkey is very close to

268
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,750
Romania and I'd like you to meet Boris a

269
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,840
Cleavon who is a Turkish journalist who

270
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,270
in the past years was very critical of

271
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,730
the current government in Turkey now

272
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,990
Boresha story is very interesting

273
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,000
because she was recently released for

274
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,580
prison from prison where he spent more

275
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,670
than one year and a half behind bars

276
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:25,240
following an event that kind of went

277
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,540
like this the weekend before his arrest

278
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,300
somebody broke into his office and

279
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,650
physically removed the harddrive from

280
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,900
his computer planted some incriminating

281
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,210
documents there and then put the hydro

282
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,370
harddrive back so then when the police

283
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,260
discovered those documents they had a

284
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,900
very good reason to arrest burisch now

285
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,790
how do we know that burisch was not the

286
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,680
one who to put those documents on that

287
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,650
hard drive well this was uncovered by

288
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,360
security researchers at Arsenal if I

289
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,860
remember right who did a forensics

290
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,630
investigation on behalf of Mauritius

291
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,880
lawyers so they analyzed those hard

292
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,580
drives and they published the paper in

293
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,860
which you can see exactly what happened

294
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,000
there through the you know from the

295
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,810
windows log files and not only that the

296
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,960
conclusions were that those files were

297
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,120
planted on the hard drive at night on a

298
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,830
Friday night at 10:00 p.m. while his

299
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,630
computer was turned off and while nobody

300
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,520
was in the office but even more than

301
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,530
that in the week previous to his arrest

302
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,470
his computer was attacked 12 times with

303
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,210
the octopod which is a nation

304
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,140
state-sponsored Trojan and octopod means

305
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,470
octopus in in Turkish now you might ask

306
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,800
yourself why does all this matters and

307
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,120
the reason why I wanted to tell you

308
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,850
Boresha story is to actually try to

309
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,830
touch a more important point which is

310
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,100
the fact that the things that we do in

311
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,200
this industry matter quite a lot and

312
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,360
it's not always necessarily a simple

313
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,130
question of protecting your data in

314
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,200
Bruce's case it was a question of

315
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,030
protecting his Liberty you know his

316
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,870
actual physical freedom and even more

317
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,730
than that when talking about journalists

318
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,700
generally limiting Internet freedom is a

319
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,640
bad thing for journalism because you

320
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,410
know journalism is one of the most

321
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,970
important pillars of our modern

322
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,160
democratic societies so journalists

323
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,690
should always be free to do their jobs

324
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,570
and things such as mass surveillance or

325
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,050
targeted attacks these are things that

326
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,510
can stop them in their way of you know

327
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,120
finding sources agreeing to communicate

328
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,270
with sources and more especially

329
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,160
protecting your sources so doing your

330
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,660
job becomes much harder when the

331
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,640
Internet is not free on the Internet is

332
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,250
balkanized and when surveillance is

333
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,350
ubiquitous

334
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,690
the bigger picture even bigger picture

335
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:46,000
is that everybody changes their behavior

336
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,100
when they're under mass surveillance I

337
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,540
mean you don't have to read the knocks

338
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,339
for study to understand that even though

339
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:53,410
there is a study and I recommend you to

340
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,800
read it but I think that all of us had a

341
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,780
moment when you know maybe we wanted to

342
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,490
post the state of some Facebook or on

343
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,380
Twitter and then we got a second thought

344
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,570
like hey what if my employer will read

345
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,760
this what if my friends will read this

346
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,440
what my family will read this and then

347
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,589
we'll just self censor ourselves I

348
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:13,570
probably half of the people here who

349
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,280
have twitter accounts they've written in

350
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,690
their bio that you know these

351
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,400
whit's are my own and they're not my

352
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,690
employer so you always have to think

353
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,970
what happens if you post something that

354
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,340
some people might disagree with and I

355
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,080
think that self-censorship cannot lead

356
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,940
to anything good can it so the human

357
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,150
intellect is not the only thing

358
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,400
prospering when information is allowed

359
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,640
to flow freely our wallets are also

360
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,920
prospering there's a McKinsey study that

361
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,100
shows that 21 percent of growth in the

362
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,890
GDP in modern countries is relying on

363
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,690
the growth of the internet so it's

364
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,470
directly proportional so just as you

365
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,140
know civilizations on the path of the

366
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,590
ancient Silk Road prospered because of

367
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,020
this ancient trading route in the same

368
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,840
way Ross Ulbricht prospered from the

369
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,420
Moller Silk Road now Ross Ulbricht was

370
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,820
an extreme libertarian and he really

371
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,320
believed that you know people should

372
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,690
have their own choice with what kind of

373
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,520
things they want to buy or what kind of

374
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,500
things they want to use of course he set

375
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,330
up this underground marketplace which

376
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,730
was this became essentially the Amazon

377
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,400
of illegal things selling things such as

378
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,920
fake IDs illegal guns or dangerous drugs

379
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,870
so of course his website attracted the

380
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,390
attention of law enforcement who seized

381
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,160
his web site and got Ross will be

382
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,350
arrested that was the moment when we all

383
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,240
realized that Ross Ulbricht became very

384
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,310
rich by just you know being the

385
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,990
middleman from all of these illegal

386
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:48,550
transactions so yeah the Silk Road both

387
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,010
the Silk Road takedown and the fact that

388
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,720
Silk Road existed could not have

389
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,820
happened without the internet could not

390
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,920
have happened without international

391
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,420
collaboration and without

392
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,480
different entities working together and

393
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,270
cooperating together so I think the same

394
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,540
thing is happening in our in our

395
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,030
industry because we couldn't do anything

396
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,970
without cooperation I mean pretty much

397
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,520
every company here in the room analyzes

398
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,100
more than 300,000 new malicious software

399
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,150
samples every day and how do we find the

400
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,620
needle in the haystack how do we find

401
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,780
those really interesting things that we

402
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,030
want to come to Virus Bulletin and talk

403
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,930
about and present to the world

404
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,030
is that the you know the great minds

405
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,830
that we have in the industry for sure

406
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,470
maybe is it the bare metal servers that

407
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,120
we can all afford to buy and the cloud

408
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,940
infrastructure that we can afford to use

409
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,250
sure but I think most importantly it's

410
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,350
the fact that we can cooperate is the

411
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,840
fact that we can share research is the

412
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,870
fact that we can take somebody else's

413
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,540
research and contribute and take that

414
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,070
research further so if I think about it

415
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,170
when I joined this industry more than 10

416
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,619
years ago and I was a young guy I think

417
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,359
that one of the things that surprised me

418
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,790
the most was this vast amount of

419
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,680
cooperation that was happening between

420
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,690
researchers that were actually working

421
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,250
for competing companies so I was

422
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,400
mesmerised by this but it makes sense

423
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,720
because at the end of the day we're all

424
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,640
fighting the same fight we all have the

425
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,640
same goals so sharing thread data and

426
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,550
generally coming together as one in the

427
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,890
fight against malware is something that

428
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,930
I really love about this industry of all

429
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,480
the conferences and everything that we

430
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,910
do but the thing is when I look around

431
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,050
nowadays I'm not really sure that

432
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,940
cooperation and collaboration has actual

433
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,260
bright future because digital

434
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,000
nationalism and nationalism generally is

435
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,070
a trend that seems to be happening more

436
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,930
and more around the world and you know

437
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,850
looking at all sorts of protectionist

438
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,880
legislation that is being drafted up and

439
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,490
even passed in different countries this

440
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,440
is why I'm not so optimistic about the

441
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,320
future of this and the thing is

442
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,480
historically you know nationalism was a

443
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,150
concept that's dating for us back as the

444
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,440
18th century and it's an ideology that

445
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,790
promotes indiscriminate love for your

446
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:21,180
country and for your interests of your

447
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,880
of your nation-state and usually

448
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,710
nationalists believe that you know their

449
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,890
nation is more important than

450
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,210
collectively what's happening in the

451
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,190
human civilization and I think that this

452
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,220
ideology was responsible for both of the

453
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,960
world wars that we've had in the past

454
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,290
years was a century and for tens of

455
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,820
millions of lives that were

456
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,420
last worldwide so not a very big fan of

457
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,770
this and if you look at what's happening

458
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,280
online because most mostly everybody

459
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,720
that's online is using show social

460
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,580
networks you can see that these cracks

461
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,590
and these divisions in our society are

462
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,590
being amplified by the internet we are

463
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,410
all organized in our own little bubbles

464
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,210
and the problem is that these bubbles

465
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,150
tend to become more and more let's say

466
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,010
separate that more and more divided with

467
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:11,490
each other

468
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,650
so we were supposed to all be on the

469
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,420
internet to connect with each other and

470
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,100
to try to understand each other and

471
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,690
accept each other but it turns out that

472
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,790
we're using the Internet in a way that

473
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:26,490
you know it's it's it's it's dividing us

474
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,680
and instead of giving voice for example

475
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,110
marginalized groups or giving voice to

476
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,350
powerless people we're giving voice to

477
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,740
extremism or you know things that can

478
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,550
really polarize our views and I think

479
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,740
that the inability to understand the

480
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,380
differences between us are becoming more

481
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,800
and more more and more prevalent but

482
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,600
what can we do about it

483
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,610
the thing is when I go to conferences

484
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,860
and I look around at what we're doing in

485
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,540
the industry I think that we have the

486
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,770
tendency to work too much and not to

487
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,110
think about what we are working on that

488
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,080
much like somebody said yesterday in a

489
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,390
presentation that it's a hit-and-run

490
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,130
type of approach when you're publishing

491
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,870
things so we're just very excited to

492
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,080
find the next big thing and and move

493
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,240
over and move on and I think this is a

494
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,790
problem with engineers everywhere not

495
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,250
just in the security industry not just

496
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,290
researchers in the in the security

497
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,270
industry I think sometimes we need to

498
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,550
take a step back look at the history try

499
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,590
to learn some things maybe tried not to

500
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,530
repeat some of the things that some of

501
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,570
the mistakes that the humankind has made

502
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40,560
in the past and of course we need to

503
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,270
have a debate about the things that are

504
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:47,640
happening in in our industry so I'm

505
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,110
saying all this because I think we have

506
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,720
a huge responsibility to every Internet

507
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,820
users out there as the ones who are

508
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,740
trying to protect the day

509
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,340
who are trying to protect human rights

510
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,580
at the end of the day I think and one

511
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,100
parallel which I like quite a lot to

512
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,929
draw is the one between computer

513
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:09,330
researchers and doctors and medical

514
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,460
doctors because cyber secure server

515
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,470
security researchers are essentially in

516
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,770
my view the doctors of the future and

517
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,559
you know just like any medical doctor

518
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,770
took the Hippocratic oath and they would

519
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,170
essentially you know treat every patient

520
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,090
let's say if there's a conflict zone or

521
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,980
a war zone a doctor will treat any

522
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,990
patient no matter from what side of the

523
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,300
border that patient's patient is I think

524
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,429
that cyber security researchers should

525
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:37,920
do the same thing I should be neutral in

526
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,080
the face of the threats that we are

527
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,179
analyzing and that we need to protect

528
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:48,840
Internet users from so just before

529
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,540
ending this talk I'd like to take you

530
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,170
back again to the past and spend a

531
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,390
little time to think of how researchers

532
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,420
that were part of the Manhattan Project

533
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,700
worked because this year marks the 73rd

534
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,880
anniversary anniversary if we can say

535
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,460
that of the only time in the history of

536
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,160
the human civilization which atomic

537
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,590
bombs were used so hundreds of people

538
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:17,100
hundreds of thousands of people died in

539
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,500
Japan because of that and if you look at

540
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,590
how the greatest minds in nuclear

541
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,650
physics research worked back then you

542
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,820
realize that everything was very

543
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,820
compared compartmentalized everybody was

544
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,530
working on their own little piece of the

545
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:35,190
puzzle and somebody way up high was

546
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,750
putting all these pieces of the puzzles

547
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,620
together

548
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,350
and this made me think because sometimes

549
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,690
I have the feeling that the security

550
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,630
industry is going in the same direction

551
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,240
and it's something that it's something

552
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,309
that that worries me because I'm

553
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:52,380
thinking that what if these researchers

554
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,450
would have had the same freedom that we

555
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,740
have nowadays you know to communicate

556
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,270
with each other to share the information

557
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,220
with each other maybe they would have

558
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,350
realized that they are going in a

559
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,450
direction in which there's no return and

560
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,250
maybe that thousands of lives that were

561
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,640
lost would have been spared

562
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,130
the Internet has such power and it's up

563
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:16,320
to us if we use it or not so a couple of

564
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,960
conclusions I'm not here to judge if

565
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,690
things such as balkanization are good or

566
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,630
bad and I'm not here to judge if things

567
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,550
are just total freedom are good or bad

568
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:29,430
the only thing that I know for sure is

569
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:32,070
that we as humans we want to

570
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,770
continuously evolve and we can only

571
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,340
evolve if we have real choice and we can

572
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,530
only have real choice if we have free

573
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:44,370
access to information and unrestricted

574
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,900
access to what's happening around the

575
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,690
world and what keeps me up at night is

576
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,520
the fact that I'm looking at

577
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,460
government's nowadays and understanding

578
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,800
that they already have decided what kind

579
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,660
of internet they want from tests for

580
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,040
themselves they want an Internet in

581
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,680
which they have the control they have

582
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,260
the filtering mechanisms and they can

583
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,240
always say what kind of things you want

584
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,160
to read you have you are allowed to read

585
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,660
what kind of things you're not allowed

586
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,090
to read or what kind of software you're

587
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,550
allowed to use and I think that this is

588
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,860
a very important moment for us as

589
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,710
security researchers to make this

590
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,960
decision like what do we want the future

591
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,850
of the internet to look like what do

592
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,830
what kind of internet do we want our

593
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,030
kids to use in the future

594
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,920
is it an Internet in which everything is

595
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,810
censored and surveilled and monitored

596
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:34,140
just like George Orwell's 1984 or is the

597
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,960
Internet in which there's free access to

598
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,660
every kind of resource idea algorithm or

599
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,730
piece of code that could the you know

600
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,940
community puts out out there and things

601
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,030
such as freedom to access all this

602
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,160
information and freedom to have privacy

603
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,650
and security are essentially basic human

604
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,630
rights so this is the question that I

605
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,490
like to leave you with and I'd like to

606
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,220
thank you for paying attention

607
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,829
[Applause]
