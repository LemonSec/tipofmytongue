00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,200
okay next presentation we are receiving

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,649
Benoir cell and alexei coupe rings with

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,290
the presentation the wolf in sheep's

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,070
clothing

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,340
undress it guys welcome thank you good

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,289
morning morning thank you for coming so

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:16,740
early

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,140
it's 9:30 we are my name is Alexei

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,340
Kudrin and yeah and I'm sad when French

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,550
living in Denmark and working for CSS

11
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,668
yes and today we're going to talk to you

12
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,820
about a case we discovered about the

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,040
various malware's and in toll related to

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,629
that so to begin how it all began we've

15
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,789
have found we were researching a banking

16
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,370
Trojan on a particular subnet and it

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,090
happened to have IP which has over 1200

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,489
domains resolved to it one of them stood

19
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,590
out just instantly because it was

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,399
obvious drop zone and it looks like a

21
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,280
portray of Google Play Store and it's

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,869
especially interesting because it

23
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:09,119
actually delivers three different

24
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,810
payloads depending on your user agent

25
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,350
including iOS which instantly makes it

26
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,290
incredibly interesting

27
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,110
there is also Windows so yep rediscover

28
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,479
Windows I jumped I will just go quickly

29
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,130
on the bathtub because it's not a

30
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,680
marathon so it was a rat and Windows

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,780
something built in debug mode

32
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,970
very well detected on various I was

33
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,250
stood already in virus to tell like

34
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,320
around 20 feature deal with fight

35
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,610
services

36
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,650
stuff like that stealing credential

37
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,860
typical rat but nothing really advanced

38
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,600
or fancy like you very lame rat same

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,420
more or less supplies for the Android

40
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,700
agent which is long story short

41
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,009
absolutely basic rat it does nothing

42
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,780
special there is something unusual

43
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,140
something related to screen recognition

44
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,969
but I'm not sure if it works you can

45
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:05,159
find the code on github if you're really

46
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,270
curious of course iOS malware yes

47
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,879
unfortunately we were did not have a lot

48
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,950
of luck reversing it

49
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,110
because that app happens to freeze the

50
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,239
phone and have a little later learned

51
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:19,519
that the only thing that sort of works

52
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:21,110
sometimes is the keyboard logging

53
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,620
functionality we can conclude that this

54
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,730
is incomplete alpha stage so at this

55
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,950
point we have found somebody who

56
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,019
apparently tried to play with Windows on

57
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,200
the raid on iOS it became of laneway but

58
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,120
he tried to do something it's a lot of

59
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,069
yeah copy paste a lot of bugs in the

60
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:42,319
application iOS we don't really know

61
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,390
it's if it's a real application of just

62
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,630
a scam so it looked like a new actor who

63
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,690
is trying to do something new he has

64
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,079
found some panels so in my case I've

65
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,760
never seen this one before us which look

66
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,739
like interesting something new new C&C

67
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:02,510
from modern web 9 where and after quick

68
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,370
after quick look here tap here that

69
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,049
everything is open on the C&C you have

70
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:07,880
open directory everywhere and you can

71
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,739
grab everything all the backup of the

72
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:12,290
databases of the C&C and all the stolen

73
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,930
victim's data you can access to every

74
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,290
single record you have a picture of

75
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,239
document some configuration of the

76
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,100
smartphone everything that has been

77
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,170
installed are available to everybody

78
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,190
it's around 20 gigabyte of data and it's

79
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:33,709
pretty good after looking at this data

80
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:36,620
we have found pictures that seem to be

81
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,889
from the development environment and we

82
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:41,510
can conclude quickly that this is a

83
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,139
slightly more organized actor than a

84
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:46,609
14-year old in the basement there is an

85
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:48,799
office should happen to have flags for

86
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,109
whatever reasons a large screen with

87
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:53,769
their software and generally looks like

88
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:56,299
like a software environment so after

89
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:58,639
looking for more data we have concluded

90
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,280
who this is who is responsible for all

91
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,440
this and that we have found this person

92
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,380
to be called Kumar Manish him yes first

93
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,630
we found only very subtle mentions of

94
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,609
Wolff research and Kumar Manish liked

95
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:16,760
the photo of the star and the logo of

96
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,430
Wolff research but a little bit later we

97
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,959
have started finding slightly more

98
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,820
identifying pieces of information about

99
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,490
this person

100
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,180
like whatsapp conversations Western

101
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,300
Union received the real credit card this

102
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,479
is not a joke so who is worth research

103
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,310
if you have never heard about port

104
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,979
research it's just another company who

105
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,069
we sell some spyware to government

106
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:42,690
Homeland Security and stuff like that

107
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,900
the HQ its base in Germany so it's a

108
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,819
your parent company and they have a

109
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:50,069
fishy and tsipras Bulgaria Bulgaria

110
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:52,800
Romania India they said that they have

111
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,470
offices in the US but we don't have any

112
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,280
proof from them maybe you already know

113
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,979
what research because this company has

114
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,020
already being the news for example for

115
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,159
trying to scam the Mauritanian

116
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:08,220
government for 2.5 million euro

117
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,250
they have tried to say that they have

118
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,349
zero day for iOS but they don't have

119
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:15,000
this ready for iOS and the Mauritanian

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,159
government was pissed off so they say

121
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:19,889
send somebody to Mauritania and kuba

122
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:21,750
Manish was afraid to go in Mauritania to

123
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,849
not be in jail so he sent his bodyguard

124
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:25,710
and his bodyguard spent some years in

125
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,020
jail because of Kumar vanish so kind of

126
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,050
famous story in it area another fun fact

127
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,909
if you look in the hacking team leaks a

128
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,710
new type common issue with found plenty

129
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,199
of story about this gallium it's pretty

130
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,300
fun that the CEO of hacking team cordis

131
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,469
get the criminal of the worst game so

132
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:46,800
let's we have some audio record school

133
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,410
Manish described his company

134
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,700
[Applause]

135
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,930
[Music]

136
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,620
in pune in india with double storied

137
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,560
accessibility testing we are tested so

138
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,360
in India I don't have any development

139
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,880
only testing and these are my own

140
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,340
cousins like my family because I need

141
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:21,600
the first people I feel I need to

142
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,300
maintain the thing so thanks when each

143
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,960
come around now we knew was Ofsted so as

144
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,240
many issues mentioned there are other

145
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,700
companies involved with us and later we

146
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,980
found handles to the referencing these

147
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,080
companies the development that he

148
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,060
mentioned is called the code Aero

149
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,120
company and the testers are square bits

150
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,690
we have found references to the code

151
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,950
arrow yep

152
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,960
a guy appear everywhere and so guy

153
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,210
called Eureka - and it looks like to be

154
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,740
the main developer of the iOS and

155
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,780
Android part is another guy and

156
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,000
everything is invited to a company

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,040
called decode that arrow in the census

158
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,080
they have lived that directory so you

159
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,820
can read all the commit message and

160
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,160
staff say commit message with decoded

161
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,100
arrow email and you have found some

162
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,080
screenshot in the open directory of this

163
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,480
wall face of slag and you can see your

164
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,040
agree to discussing with command issue

165
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,900
at home if they can build new some

166
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,090
terrorist Africa so it look like this

167
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,580
from an improvement we have some commit

168
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,790
message for example this is a

169
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,100
certificate use for the iOS application

170
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,500
and I have used the same certificate as

171
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,140
a legend echo dot arrow certificate the

172
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,370
co dot arrow developed a lot of

173
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,680
different little application around and

174
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,930
I use a sense of ticket for the legit

175
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,330
application and for this kind of is

176
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,620
favored the testing company is called

177
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,570
square base and it is indeed based in

178
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,780
India the references to the square bills

179
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,170
were found through URL that we found in

180
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,870
the database which was a link to Google

181
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,600
Drive which as you can see anyone can

182
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,720
view the zip that you see in this Drive

183
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,700
include the sources for everything

184
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,900
related to the mobile part of the

185
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,009
and it features also plenty of

186
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:13,809
references to square beds their domain

187
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:17,289
their user names and testing messages

188
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,650
there's plenty besides that in the

189
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,949
testing data you can find some

190
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:25,389
identifying information possibly it's

191
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:27,460
people who've been testing this malware

192
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,710
and they happen to have a last name

193
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,979
Kumar it's maybe his baby

194
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:38,500
maybe he so now let's try to have a look

195
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,419
at what we have found in the database so

196
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,279
it's did many different breakup of

197
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,078
databases and we have tried to extract

198
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:47,649
every IP public IP just choose public IP

199
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:50,290
to do localized editing so you can see

200
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,600
you have a lot of it in India but it's

201
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,300
probably just the testing team you have

202
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,180
some victims in China Kazakhstan in the

203
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,209
Middle East in a giovanna Israel you

204
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:04,060
have some victims in Europe in France in

205
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,029
Germany but the HQ is in Germany so

206
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:10,000
maybe solitude in Ukraine and country

207
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,300
like that so it definitely looked like

208
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,970
some demo smartphone used by cells

209
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,100
around the world for making some develop

210
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,660
the project and trying to resell the

211
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,949
product to other people

212
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:23,920
and it's many different actor around

213
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,740
work research many different restaurant

214
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,620
partnership on many different company we

215
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,720
don't look at all this company all the

216
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,980
company Nichols there are a lot of

217
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,959
company but we have choose the biggest

218
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,269
name so this is for example annual

219
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:42,339
record that can confirm that this is a

220
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:51,269
serous muffin and demos market

221
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:55,889
and then you can use this

222
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,029
[Music]

223
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:24,439
[Music]

224
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,680
so anyway this discussion about meetings

225
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,740
and exchanging information about the

226
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:43,080
project if you have found another so

227
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,010
this is some exchangeable stuff so first

228
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,620
big actor work research we have next

229
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,150
sighs you don't know Nick search the

230
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,670

net rottens big Network interception

234
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,750
have found many reference to French

smartphone is registered by next attack

238
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,900
we have some SMS in the databases and a

00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,180
lot of stuff apk called next a tracker

240

route ID number on Google you found in

242
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,990

244
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:36,600
dodgy fair light from for example this

245
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:43,310
French that's it if you have some

246
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,810
databases you can see some estimates

247
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,540
from DHL senior packages available at

248
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,810
some place and it was a very there are

249
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,600
more interesting companies mentioned in

250
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,700
there we're not aware of particular

251
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,590
relation or we found that pictures and

252
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,040
the testing data of company called

253
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,110
whisper if you don't know about whisker

254
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,030
basically they work with wild

255
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,060
interception and we have seen photos of

256
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,610
whisper tools but we think it's whisper

257
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,670
tools and it's unusual with because you

258
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,530
don't see that every day you can also

259
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,200
find references in the testing data of

260
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,800
handles of a phone called wispier on the

261
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,600
second the second line is a device

262
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,370
called whisper I hope you can read that

263
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,830
but that's very little besides that

264
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,590
there is also pictures of the office

265
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,480
environment on the screen little screen

266
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,120
that's at the unreadable text is running

267
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,430
console types that describes seemingly

268
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,010
man-in-the-middle operation but doesn't

269
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,080
reveal a whole lot another thing is the

270
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,930
geolocation tags that are matched the

271
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,650
office of a whisperer they also screen

272
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,410
photos of the internal of the GUI of

273
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,680
their software and the running and

274
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,200
visible text mentions men in the middle

275
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,570
andreas iPhone we can only guess what

276
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,850
that means and pretty box on the right

277
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,900
has a logo of who is peer and has it has

278
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,960
a electronic circuit so we think this is

279
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,240
hardware related to whisper yes we have

280
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,070
found a lot of information about another

281
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,470
company in Cyprus called process it's a

282
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,300
paramilitary company we normally you

283
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,770
know what they do with this company but

284
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,810
we have plenty of picture of the HQ of

285
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,590
process so maybe they deal with them

286
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,570
so it's a big part in partnership with

287
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,000
many different company we have many many

288
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,740
different company around the world we

289
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,080
have found some real targets but we will

290
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,880
not say anything about that because two

291
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,770
critical and the right people already

292
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,780
know what to do with this but we have we

293
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,960
are victims to some testing firm and

294
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:52,590
other open yeah how they work yep for

295
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,660
instance this is the scene see for the

296
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,340
windows malware if you have ever seen

297
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,470
any rat for Windows C and C for the

298
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,480
Ornish not seeing anything you probably

299
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,050
it's not an advance

300
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,430
it's nothing related to hacking thing to

301
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,430
me and other other tools there appears

302
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,510
that they have purchased mr. yeah a

303
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,120
crypto software from mr. black hat and

304
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,579
or other respected in

305
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:20,029
visuals that they have been using for

306
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:22,459
their campaign locally so yeah we have

307
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:24,589
found some pictures at the critter core

308
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:27,170
w1 crypto so we go on Google type WM

309
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,029
crypto and you have found this archive

310
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:32,689
is the source code of w1 critter in the

311
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:34,309
source code you can raise I try to do

312
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:36,379
some traits like let's hook a credit

313
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:39,170
process W and antivirus don't hook read

314
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,779
process W scoop appear on and as you can

315
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:43,220
see there are detected by every

316
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,529
Ontiveros we have found these funny

317
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:48,199
kittens I use some paper to tell like

318
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:50,029
virustotal but in the paper always a

319
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:52,009
check they tested with antivirus and

320
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:54,199
check sub boxes yes they use TeamViewer

321
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:59,149
from this casing we can try to guess

322
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,949
about attack vector so if we previously

323
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:03,410
mentioned there was a drop zone website

324
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,379
that that's the way to deliver android

325
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:08,480
obviously but you can also actually find

326
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,299
the unpacked version of this malware on

327
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:12,949
Google Play Store I mean you could a

328
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:15,829
little bit before that and it's called

329
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:21,169
wolf 3 VPN we think that may be a victim

330
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:23,929
could be told that this is a VPN client

331
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:26,179
and then they would be given a private

332
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:28,249
password for that client that needs to

333
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:29,779
enter and then the malware starts

334
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:33,169
working but the password is actually

335
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:34,579
hard-coded in the app and it's not

336
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:37,220
office gated in any way we have notified

337
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,929
Google about this they made sure that

338
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:40,999
it's going to be flagged on Android

339
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:42,980
devices and yeah we are we see new

340
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,619
screenshot and application with an

341
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:46,850
install on this motto

342
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:53,749
yes more meetings of course so say it's

343
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:55,489
an audio record where they discussed

344
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:58,179
attack vectors

345
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:15,130
no we are not rooting with this breaking

346
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,680
if you don't do their work you cannot go

347
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,020
there people you cannot kind of all fall

348
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,200
away

349
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:28,180
[Music]

350
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,430
we can do only when we do it

351
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,490
so this because we have some question

352
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,440
did they have zero day and a promises I

353
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,470
don't have you ready and this one is

354
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,390
against Google day

355
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:50,839
yeah more about the tech factors nobody

356
00:16:50,839 --> 00:17:03,520
know even then and us wouldn't catch on

357
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,379
[Music]

358
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:19,790
fire engine and we didn't until we found

359
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:28,220
this solution so this guy was saying we

360
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,380
don't use tor on earth because we use

361
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,840
google play and it's like marketing

362
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,270
 meeting was like what the

363
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:40,460
others remain at some time some pictures

364
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,830
appear and we have these pictures from a

365
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,290
meeting and a lot of Java code appear at

366
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,080
after this picture look like Kumar

367
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,120
Manish has register without saying

368
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,100
anything to anybody he has record all

369
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,260
the meeting he has with people and all

370
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,620
this record was sent to the CNC so we

371
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,420
have access to a lot of record regarding

372
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,100
this meeting we don't know where was

373
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,380
this meeting that they discussed a lot

374
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,250
of interesting stuff

375
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,530
[Applause]

376
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,579
[Music]

377
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,149
so this guy are afraid to be disco girl

378
00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:44,140
sorry

379
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,490
too bad dog too bad this one but an

380
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,899
Iranian company probably rated to 0 D

381
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:59,110
days although they are coming for the

382
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:19,000
company but they don't have so much it

383
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,220
was a discussion between two guys and

384
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,700
apparently one say because come on each

385
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,620
day we sell spyware and we don't have

386
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,720
exploit or whatever and the guys say

387
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,789
something like you can ask to israelian

388
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:32,860
companies I have exploit and the guys

389
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,230
say but is too expensive Kumar says I

390
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,039
have the budget don't worry something

391
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,590
about South America a million

392
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,130
[Music]

393
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,640
[Music]

394
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,730
really how many meetings with them three

395
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,910
Costa sector the public would like to

396
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,020
take the tops off until until tiny clips

397
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:18,470
of my family some audio records of the

398
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,600
discussing how kuma managed deal with

399
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,250
repressive government with scenario

400
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,800
parent company we are not a row to deal

401
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:45,500
with every every country in the world we

402
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:56,630
had in 2015 till the time and that's

403
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,460
probably why if you remember at the

404
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,980
beginning with the picture of the idea

405
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,440
of the Kumar I mean II have some Egypt

406
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,120
visa so it's probably related to

407
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,180
destroyed so this point we have correct

408
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,340
a lot of information and these guys

409
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,530
seems to be a kind of criminal who try

410
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,350
to scam people with shitty product he

411
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,940
tried to make money like that we don't

412
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,590
have the time to discuss everything it's

413
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,180
only the tip of the iceberg

414
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,450
we have plenty of that we are very

415
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,790
surprised because this kind of very bad

416
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,620
behavior can compromise a lot of

417
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,200
international operation and at this

418
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,540
point we are thinking this does this

419
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,200
company to legit company or does it some

420
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,450
just criminal guy we are not able to

421
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,230
know and now with we had this question

422
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,810
to say who is currently regulating this

423
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,970
business because this guy seems to have

424
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,190
access to government and other big

425
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,800
company and he make money like that and

426
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,510
it's very surprising we have some

427
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,490
pictures of him buying big cars and

428
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,440
stuff like that so this guy he's making

429
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,850
money it's just a scammer who deal with

430
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,300
government so very strong story but it's

431
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,720
worth research

432
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,509
and that's our thoughts this is your

433
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:15,259
question
