1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,220
thank you please take your seats and

2
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:06,720
join me in welcoming sorrow to come talk

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,800
to us about wipers in the wild thank you

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,660
hi everyone thanks for coming to my talk

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,190
I am Sahara I am a threat intelligence

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,690
analyst at BAE Systems Applied

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,630
intelligence so today I'm gonna talk to

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,330
you about wipers which is a pretty big

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,289
topic hot topic these days and one of

10
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,660
the things that kind of Drew me to

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,100
looking at this is the the increased use

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,890
by state actors especially that we've

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,379
seen for different purposes but

14
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,600
especially because they make such kind

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,840
of high impact you know destructive yeah

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,250
operations so let's get started I'm just

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,129
gonna cover briefly high-level kind of

18
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:57,449
throughout the presentation so the

19
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,329
technical details and kind of in-depth

20
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,730
analysis will be in the paper but it

21
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,040
won't have time to cover so first let's

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,750
start off with just a look at the

23
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,640
anatomy kind of what the function of a

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,920
wiper is or what it does and then go

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,650
into kind of deeper analysis about the

26
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,920
use over over the last several years and

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,939
kind of pull out some interesting

28
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,090
significant insights and then I'll go

29
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,970
through some case studies of kind of the

30
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,369
different purposes that demonstrate the

31
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:27,090
different purposes

32
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,610
of wipers which I've divided into three

33
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,400
sections one being espionage when is

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,460
sabotage and one is diversion so again

35
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,869
there's more case studies in the paper

36
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:40,020
but for time time constraints I'll just

37
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,479
keep it to a couple and then I'll wrap

38
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,280
up with some conclusions and kind of an

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,850
outlook but really draw out some of the

40
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,820
important important points from my from

41
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,710
my research so very basically anatomy of

42
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,670
a wiper you have a couple things you you

43
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,409
know have the have the payload and you

44
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,380
have a delivery mechanism so usually the

45
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,689
payload will target kind of one or a

46
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:09,899
subset of these three areas so files are

47
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,239
pretty popular a lot of the time this

48
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,690
can be based on cat

49
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,460
extension file extension or in

50
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,430
particular folders the boot section is

51
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,640
obviously targeted as well so kind of

52
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,750
MBR and that that can be corrupted and

53
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,540
lastly what you see sometimes is backups

54
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,060
and shadow copies being targeted often

55
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,600
the files will remain intact unless you

56
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,820
do go and delete the backups and

57
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,030
proclamation mechanism that is just a

58
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,920
separate note that I had because there

59
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,090
was wipers and there was wipe or worms

60
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,500
so that can remote copy and self execute

61
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,600
across machines so I won't be talking

62
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,850
about those in particular but just to be

63
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,180
aware that that is also part of what

64
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,620
makes up a wiper so briefly I'm gonna

65
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,850
just go through a little bit of a

66
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,850
history so wipers have been around for

67
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,880
for a while several years last decade

68
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,340
you can see kind of different different

69
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,500
types of attacks so some things that

70
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,030
you'll notice are that obviously the the

71
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,290
primary kind of purpose of wipers in

72
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,730
these operations has been for sabotage

73
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,739
so again the destructive kind of

74
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,010
function is also is also the purpose but

75
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,440
one of the things that I do want to make

76
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,670
kind of a distinction between is that

77
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,100
the functionality which murine it

78
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,750
reflects the anatomy of the wiper a

79
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,480
destructive payload is not always the

80
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,050
same as the intent so you'll see kind of

81
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,850
in in the last ten years a handful of

82
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,370
attacks it looks kind of evenly spread

83
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,630
out but really what you'll see is in the

84
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,660
last three years kind of seven or eight

85
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,160
incidents that have happened and and

86
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,920
definitely made kind of headlines and

87
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,050
not just for kind of sabotage purposes

88
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,830
but also a new a new strategy that I'll

89
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,070
talk about in in detail talking about

90
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,620
the last actor who as using wipers for

91
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:15,459
diversion so the first case study that I

92
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,798
want to talk about is flame again which

93
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,320
we've already heard a little bit about

94
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,970
today and it's kind of one of the older

95
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,760
classic cyber espionage operations back

96
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,300
from in 2012

97
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,530
so this was an interesting case where

98
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,560
you know flame was a again very complex

99
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,350
piece of malware and one of kind of the

100
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,039
most sophisticated that we've seen in a

101
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:42,870
while but we'll collect everything from

102
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,389
keystrokes to audio files to documents

103
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:49,050
to screenshots and really was was

104
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,300
definitely used as an espionage kind of

105
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,180
tool and so one of the things I want to

106
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,300
point out is that this did have a wiper

107
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,180
component it was one small part of you

108
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,639
know again a complex malware with

109
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,979
multiple kind of modules and things and

110
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,570
so what you'll see is that the purpose

111
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,600
really is of this malware was long-term

112
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,970
surveillance over a short term sabotage

113
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,400
despite kind of the wiper aspect of it

114
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,449
and so in this case which would be not a

115
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:20,370
most common for wipers being used in

116
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,570
espionage scenarios was kind of for

117
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,699
cleanup and cover-up of the operation so

118
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,919
the attackers were very thorough in

119
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,949
terms of cleaning up after of their own

120
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:34,349
infrastructure their servers kind of

121
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:37,050
wiping existing log files disabling

122
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,300
logging so there were quite a few there

123
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,460
were several components of this that

124
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,870
went back and methodically kind of

125
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:51,320
erased any traces of their infection so

126
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,909
that's that's something that just is

127
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:56,340
kind of wiper in context but again not

128
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,289
for not necessarily for the destructive

129
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:01,110
purposes of of targeting the victim but

130
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,930
maybe just to be careful and in their

131
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,030
own operations so next I'm going to talk

132
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,159
about sabotage which again has the most

133
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:13,159
examples and so there's a lot of these

134
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:17,190
that kind of are are common

135
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,789
you know black energy you know in in the

136
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:24,539
Ukraine kind of very very common across

137
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,520
over the years and still very much

138
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,400
continuing now but one of the

139
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,960
interesting ones that is a bit older but

140
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,699
also has kind of ramifications now is

141
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,750
Dark Souls so so several institutions in

142
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,960
South Korea were were targeted

143
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,669
in this particular campaign and what

144
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:46,470
I'll get into is that you know this had

145
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,930
kind of a multiplicity of tools and kind

146
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,289
of aspects of operations so in each of

147
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:54,210
these you'll see kind of DDoS attacks

148
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,479
which were again meant to overwhelm

149
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,370
you'll see the wipers used which again

150
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,110
were meant to destroy and you'll even

151
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,910
find a back door somewhere in there

152
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:07,370
which was meant to steal information so

153
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,820
that's quite you know kind of covering a

154
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,860
lot of areas and there were three

155
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,180
separate wipers that were discovered

156
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,560
across across this campaign and you know

157
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,949
what to overwrite the hard drive and

158
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:26,849
override files and so kind of the

159
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:29,070
important point that I wanted to take

160
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,979
from this is that Dark Soul was one kind

161
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,320
of aspect of a much larger operation so

162
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,289
operation Troy which went over kind of

163
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:39,470
you can see at least a couple years

164
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,419
which was kind of an ongoing espionage

165
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:45,930
campaign and this operation Troy was

166
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,830
coupled with a military campaign as well

167
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,620
so again the wipers play a very small

168
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,159
part but again having pretty pretty high

169
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,949
impact in in these operations but again

170
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:03,750
looking at it in context it's part of a

171
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:10,110
much much larger operation so finally

172
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,580
this I'm going to spend a little bit

173
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,310
more time on because it's a strategy

174
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,320
that's kind of emerged over the last

175
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,810
couple years and particularly with one

176
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,000
actor and there's some kind of

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,199
interesting things that come out of

178
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,669
looking at this actors operations so

179
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:30,030
diversion where a wiper is being used to

180
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,750
kind of distract from the the I guess

181
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,919
the main what you'd call the main

182
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,799
operation or a kind of the intended

183
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,320
intended operation so I'll talk about

184
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,200
two examples from the same actor but

185
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,860
different different case studies so

186
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,970
Hermes was Branson where that was found

187
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,060
in a bank heist

188
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,920
kind of conducted by the Lazarus actor

189
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,400
in Taiwan so they the attackers

190
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,150
transferred 14.1 million dollars I

191
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,480
believe two kind of accounts overseas as

192
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,190
part of their as part of the bank heist

193
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,550
and then released this ransomware

194
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:18,410
immediately following so this was found

195
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,320
kind of on on the banks network with no

196
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,360
noit's worse tools but then we found

197
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,980
this ransomware so this is kind of the

198
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,020
first time and if you know if you're

199
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,460
familiar or not familiar with the

200
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,770
lazarus doctor they've been operating

201
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,200
for lost several years but in the last

202
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,120
couple years there have been several

203
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,970
bank heists which is kind of a new area

204
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,690
of interest and particularly in 2018

205
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,080
have been very active and i think this

206
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,640
is about the eighth there's been about

207
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,630
eight public heist so far and so this is

208
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,000
the first time that we see a destructive

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,790
component to their to their operations

210
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,970
so this has compiled two days before the

211
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,850
attack the dropper extracts the payload

212
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,790
and spreads the ransomware via network

213
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,830
shares so there's a couple of things

214
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,440
that will come up mistakes that you see

215
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,440
from the attackers so the plaintext is

216
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,600
decrypted in memory but not written to

217
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,510
disk so that was a coding mistake likely

218
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,720
and another kind of thing that you can

219
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,320
see on the screen so the well the

220
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,890
ransomware writes an execute a script

221
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,440
that deletes deletes backups and then

222
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,930
deletes itself so again one of the

223
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,540
things that lazarus is concerned with is

224
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,260
again kind of hiding its operations and

225
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,930
covering its tracks and complicating

226
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,400
forensics which all which i'll get to

227
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,500
kind of later but then you'll see

228
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,330
there's also a text box that shows up

229
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,820
which is again look probably a mistake

230
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,300
and so these these kind of errors that

231
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,620
you see from the attacker is again

232
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,620
compiling a couple days before and the

233
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,570
errors kind of suggest that the malware

234
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,730
might have been in testing or

235
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,980
development phases but really kind of

236
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,920
the

237
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,710
main aim was to just have a high impact

238
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,410
and deploy it as kind of a side

239
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,230
component to their main main attack

240
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,580
which was the bank heist

241
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,320
so again impact of delivery was a lot

242
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,490
more important than kind of getting

243
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:24,280
these particular details right so just

244
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,890
want to go through a bit of a comparison

245
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,870
so we talked about Dark Soul and we

246
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,240
talked about Hermes so this is actually

247
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,930
the work of the same actor and really

248
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,660
they are interested in kind of the

249
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,210
destructive component but they're you

250
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,070
know they're kind of purpose and aims

251
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,620
have shifted a little bit and similar

252
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,360
techniques but you know they've moved

253
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,150
from doing it you know kind of a MBR

254
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,310
wipe style wiper to cut ransomware in

255
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,950
this particular case but and and serving

256
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,500
slightly different purposes but

257
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,790
basically the rents more is being used

258
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,340
in a new context so again in the dark

259
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,380
soul attacks you see kind of

260
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,780
overwhelming with D doses and and

261
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,700
destructive capabilities with the wiper

262
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,270
and and you could say that was even an

263
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,000
active subversion to again kind of

264
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,410
undermine the institutions and things

265
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,990
but again more destructive this is much

266
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,520
more of a distraction the ransomware

267
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,040
doesn't serve any other purpose really

268
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,100
than to hide the the bank heist and to

269
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,450
make that more difficult to investigate

270
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,980
so the next one I want to talk about is

271
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,440
from another Lazarus case a bank heist

272
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,790
as well and this one was banco de chile

273
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,480
and that was earlier this year in May so

274
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,680
some very nice people uploaded these

275
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,589
pictures to Twitter in in May when we

276
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:49,630
were when we first found out about the

277
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,430
heist and basically what they're saying

278
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:54,040
is you know they're their computers

279
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,390
aren't working though it's not they're

280
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,800
not booting basically and there was a

281
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,000
couple different instances where

282
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,490
employees of the bank were were kind of

283
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,080
noticing this and posting about it so

284
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,050
the bank geotags their computers so we

285
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,250
could figure out you know where it was

286
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:11,589
so we started investigating so this one

287
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:14,850
obviously isn't you know Taiwan was

288
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,970
Hermes was in October 2017

289
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,620
was made 2018 so it wasn't the first

290
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,959
time that we've seen the destructive

291
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:25,649
wiper used by Lazarus but it is the

292
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:27,089
first time that we saw kind of this MBR

293
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:30,930
related related to kill disk kind of

294
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:35,100
wiper so not rents more this time so I'm

295
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,810
not gonna go through too much in detail

296
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,990
about how MBR killer works but briefly

297
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,360
it's a secure and TFS wiper targets

298
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,800
partitions

299
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,829
it's actually an installer doing the

300
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:50,100
wiping as opposed to dropping a wiper so

301
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,649
this was again this was a little bit

302
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:54,329
customized but there are variants of it

303
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:58,259
out there it's again protected by the EM

304
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:01,170
protect we this is pretty common tactic

305
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,470
of Lazarus to that to help obfuscate

306
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,310
kind of their tools and things so we

307
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,410
actually didn't find samples similar to

308
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,120
this particular one and so we they

309
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,589
haven't been identified but again it's

310
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,870
it's similar to other other variants but

311
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,430
this particular one looks like it's been

312
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,889
customized and a similar thing was true

313
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:25,740
about Hermes where the attackers did

314
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,300
customize it a little bit but it's still

315
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,720
a variance of it did exist before so the

316
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,939
idea is that a theory is that it might

317
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,639
be a one-shot tool but again the the

318
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,899
attackers are kind of using to just

319
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:40,379
serve this this one purpose but haven't

320
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,939
really put that much investment into

321
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:44,519
really there are some other interesting

322
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,149
parts about this so with MDR killer and

323
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:50,910
this particular heist and even the way

324
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,470
that Lazarus operates there's some

325
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,050
unknowns so one of the interesting

326
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:59,220
things about this is how the more kind

327
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,139
of got to all the machines on the

328
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,329
network kind of simultaneously so this

329
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:06,000
attack took out Banco de Chile's Network

330
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,309
for for several days and was pretty

331
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:11,069
impactful but it wasn't you know wasn't

332
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:12,809
demonstrating any kind of worm like

333
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:16,139
propagation again the theory could be

334
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,389
that it's using kind of leveraging

335
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:20,730
legitimate processes Windows processes

336
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,089
and if you have that level of kind of

337
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,900
domain admin credentials then

338
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,990
this is potentially how you how you kind

339
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,580
of execute wiper and get that much

340
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,250
access one more thing that I wanted to

341
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,380
point out which again I can't go in too

342
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,570
much detail but the comparison of MDR

343
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,180
killer to the other Lazarus tools that

344
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,070
we found on the network so again in all

345
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,930
the cases we'll find multiple ones and

346
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,430
some of them are they're custom kind of

347
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,230
back doors and then other ones will be

348
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,140
the wipers so the the back door that we

349
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,870
found in Banco de Chile was something we

350
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,070
call catch-22 so this is a pretty pretty

351
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,050
interesting piece of piece of kit and I

352
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,130
want to highlight the difference which

353
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,320
is that that those kind of tools and

354
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,700
previous back doors that we've seen from

355
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,260
them are a lot of investment and kind of

356
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,160
interest from the attackers and they

357
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,350
really pay attention to getting those

358
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,910
rights so and the kind of access they

359
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:20,110
have is kind of Swift Alliance platforms

360
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,930
web platforms alliance access again all

361
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,300
in secure zones of the bank and that

362
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,310
particular backdoor catch-22 can operate

363
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,160
in client and server mode so again these

364
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,800
are the the kind of access that Lazarus

365
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,370
has in the investment that it puts into

366
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,590
its actual main kind of identifiable

367
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,020
tools is very different than kind of the

368
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,620
wipers and distractions that it releases

369
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,660
to distract from from the heist

370
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:53,020
themselves so I just want to look across

371
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,880
the board at a few case studies so again

372
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,320
a few of these I talked about in my

373
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,820
paper a few of them a couple of them I

374
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,380
don't but what I do want to highlight is

375
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,310
kind of want to cry and not petty I

376
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,410
would have been talked about with other

377
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,990
other people by other people as well and

378
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,579
how there are kind of turning points so

379
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:13,920
again both kind of in this category but

380
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,089
the difference is you know there's kind

381
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,280
of the sheer number of victims if you

382
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,690
look at the other kind of attacks

383
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,170
usually what you're going to have is

384
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,400
very few victims which is likely

385
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,099
indicative of a targeted intrusion so in

386
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:29,230
this case it was kind of a mass abuse of

387
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,630
an exploit again low-cost publicly

388
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,200
available tools and so that's just one

389
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,750
thing to note and something that could

390
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,000
probably happen in the future as well

391
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,620
and then the other thing is again this

392
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,140
new kind of strategy diversion

393
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,090
that's just attackers getting creative

394
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,500
and again trying to make things

395
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,000
complicated for investigators and the

396
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,820
change in kind of strategy where again

397
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,910
Dark Soul and the the bank heists were

398
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,309
we're done by the same actors and you

399
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:03,160
know strategy is destroying data and

400
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,830
crippling systems but really you know

401
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,910
that part is a constant but the

402
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,740
techniques have differed and kind of the

403
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,200
intention has changed but this pivot

404
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,210
strategic pivot from espionage and

405
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,220
sabotage you know several years ago

406
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,320
almost you know five to ten years ago

407
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,419
it's kind of diversion and financial

408
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:21,970
gain and kind of this criminal element

409
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,610
to it as well so the the laws were

410
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,140
Swiper is really kind of mark a shift

411
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:31,419
that we might see again in the future so

412
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:33,700
I just want to wrap up with some

413
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,679
conclusions firstly again wanting to

414
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:40,630
kind of emphasize that separating

415
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,340
function from purpose and tactics from

416
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,350
strategy is really important so again

417
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,520
the function of a wiper being

418
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,740
destructive and having the destructive

419
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,780
payload it targets you know different

420
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,410
parts of a computer network and that's

421
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,179
different than kind of intent behind it

422
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:57,070
so we've seen examples of attackers

423
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,140
using wipers for different different

424
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,290
purposes and that will plan to kind of

425
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:06,910
again a larger strategy and another

426
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,500
thing I want to note is that you know

427
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,760
wiper is a lot of the time as you've

428
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,220
seen aren't used in isolation so whether

429
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,750
it's the bank heist and being used as a

430
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,500
detract destruction or as part of flame

431
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,270
to cover-up tracks in just a very small

432
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,630
component of kind of complex malware

433
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,910
there is definitely context of it being

434
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,740
used in in larger operation the same

435
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,750
with Dark Soul that was part of an

436
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,669
espionage campaign but the wiper itself

437
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,780
was used used for sabotage and even you

438
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,280
know wipers can be part of bigger

439
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,260
payloads so even in the same kind of

440
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,490
malware you can have those kind of

441
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,919
components which again you can look at

442
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,530
in the paper and then go in-depth on a

443
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,010
case study there as well so covering

444
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,570
tracks and complicating forensics I've

445
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,880
talked about this what you can see with

446
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,530
that is definitely the flame

447
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,890
people but also with Lazarus you see the

448
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,350
diversion kind of aspect coming into it

449
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,150
but they're very careful to wipe their

450
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,580
logs and traces of their presence on the

451
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,610
network so that one of the things that

452
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,170
makes things makes you know

453
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,030
investigations of this actor complicated

454
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,620
is their presence on the network for

455
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,830
several months and again much much more

456
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,990
stealthy but then the cleanup is also

457
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,580
very good and kind of comparable

458
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:23,260
comparable to flame in that way so yeah

459
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,330
what I what I mentioned before about low

460
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,800
cost implementation and high yield

461
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,110
impact so this is particularly true for

462
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,450
Lazarus none of these wipers in any of

463
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,470
the cases were particularly

464
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,750
sophisticated though the other other

465
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,510
malware may have been but especially in

466
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,610
the context of Lazarus and you know the

467
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,220
customized back doors that it uses that

468
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,710
that kind of advanced kind of malware

469
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,040
compared to these low-level wipers which

470
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,110
again some of them may have been bought

471
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,970
off the shelf or just again

472
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,250
commercialize tools that are available

473
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,650
for purchase or shared tools and they

474
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:00,640
just customized a variant so again there

475
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,300
it serves its purpose and so putting any

476
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,560
more investment into that isn't really

477
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,810
necessary and it's it's highly effective

478
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,460
so another thing I want to note with the

479
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,140
with Lazarus factors but with others as

480
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,850
well and I think this was mentioned

481
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,600
earlier and in a different talk but so

482
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,340
not Pesci has a good example as well and

483
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,130
kind of hitting supply chain and but

484
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,950
especially with the wipers the attackers

485
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,600
are definitely playing with fire here so

486
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,000
the aggressive kind of nature of these

487
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,760
attacks again it's it seems like it's

488
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,000
escalating and there's multiple examples

489
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,180
of the bank heist where we see this from

490
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,310
from Lazarus but they and and one a cry

491
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,960
is a great example of that and one of

492
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,110
the reasons I didn't classify it

493
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:49,030
sabotage or another another kind of

494
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,100
category is because it may well have

495
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,470
been accidental and so really not having

496
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,830
control over kind of what those tools do

497
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,840
and again it might not be a concern for

498
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,340
them because they're after a particular

499
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,430
objective here so but the idea is that

500
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,310
this can have much much higher impact

501
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,890
then is intended or obviously wanted by

502
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,280
by defenders or victims so something to

503
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,400
note and then finally this is pretty

504
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,410
common that you'll hear this in threat

505
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,660
Intel and in the industry and it stays

506
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,330
true for kind of the whiteboard

507
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,390
discussion as with other targeted

508
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,430
intrusions or kind of cyber operations

509
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,340
wipers are often a manifestation of

510
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,750
interstate conflict or kind of the

511
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,960
geopolitical realities so the world is

512
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,610
in a constant state of tension so that

513
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,550
never changes but the kind of way that

514
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:43,000
wipers are being used as with other as

515
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,260
with other attacks and operations are

516
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,710
really sometimes kind of reflective of

517
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,110
what's going on in the real world you

518
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,530
know between states especially so kind

519
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:59,320
of the impact here you know in terms of

520
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,900
damage of infrastructure or impact on

521
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,960
economic processes or kind of national

522
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,360
security implications that we've seen in

523
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,030
a lot of these a lot of these examples

524
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:12,550
it's kind of a all-rounder in terms of

525
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,520
impact and significance so it's the

526
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,150
threat that will definitely continue and

527
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,670
as States kind of adopt this into their

528
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,230
toolkit and it's becoming more and more

529
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,590
common that's something to to watch out

530
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,220
for so thanks for listening I appreciate

531
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,800
it and if you have any questions we have

532
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,550
a few minutes
