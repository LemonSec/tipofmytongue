1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,449
all right we'll get started there are a

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:05,100
lot of presentations happening right now

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,930
and you guys chose to be here so thank

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,830
you for that I think we'll have a fun

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,509
fun room with two fantastic

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,340
presentations I want to introduce the

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,800
first speaker my friend in borås one of

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,060
my favorite speakers I've seen him

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,619
present at many many conference you guys

10
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,330
are in for a treat because n/bar usually

11
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,369
presents bare feet and he's wearing

12
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,800
shoes today so no no I'm gonna she was

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,279
off it was too cold the air conditioning

14
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,349
if you guys never taken your shoes off

15
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,200
on stage it's really nice it's a it's a

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,460
good Zen moment and it helps you uh it

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,950
started as a as a joke a long time ago

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,300
and I would just do it for fun

19
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,670
well due to your introduction all right

20
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,680
let me unlock my computer so you could

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:56,120
all enjoy the presentation if I remember

22
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,440
there you go all right so under the hood

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,309
the automotive challenge right okay so

24
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,070
the problem what is the problem we all

25
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,760
drive cars right and we use cars to

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,140
carry the things we care about the most

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,100
right our family friends are expensive

28
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,250
stuff and we also know that if a car

29
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,020
gets hacked because we've been reading

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,299
about that little we know that something

31
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,299
bad can happen but what we don't know is

32
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,220
why is it like that I mean we know IT

33
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,930
security what we've all been doing that

34
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,939
for many years and we've come to

35
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,530
understand why things are the way they

36
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,329
are but the automotive world we're now

37
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:40,890
all very familiar with and we don't

38
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,140
really know why we keep seeing things or

39
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,450
why is it car hackable or why is it even

40
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,850
connected to the Internet and what I'm

41
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,700
going to do is try to explain to you not

42
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,350
about one hacker or another you're gonna

43
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,939
hear a lot about that even the talk

44
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,380
after me that sounds very interesting

45
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,020
you should stick around for it I'm gonna

46
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,030
try to explain to you why cars are

47
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,250
hackable and how long it's going to take

48
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,469
until it gets fixed and what are the

49
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:11,170
real risks this is a partial list of the

50
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,690
manufacturer firms in the car a car is a

51
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,780
very complex project in fact it's also

52
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,360
an outsourced project when you buy a car

53
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,330
from let's say howdy-howdy

54
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,580
doesn't make the whole car right

55
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,440
sometimes it'll only make about 30

56
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,510
percent of it and the rest come from

57
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,280
these manufacturers called tier 1 and

58
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,319
tier 2 and tier 3 they make different

59
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,989
parts and then outages puts them all

60
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,360
together and builds a car so a car is a

61
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,090
very complex product okay and it's not

62
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,730
just that car all new cars and for a

63
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,670
while back or like that this is just a

64
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,920
partial list right you have about 30 of

65
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,400
each each of them manufacturer has about

66
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,480
30 subcontractors so a car is a complex

67
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,099
product so that's one thing to remember

68
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:01,190
as far as code goes it is estimated

69
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,190
today that about 100 maybe 150 million

70
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,739
lines of code go into a new car the

71
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:09,829
chips out and just for a reference this

72
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:12,590
is more code than was needed to fly the

73
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,660
space show right to give you perspective

74
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,120
and this is something we use every day

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,329
now based on rough estimations okay you

76
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:24,709
know that you have a lot of code you

77
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:26,480
also have a lot of bugs it is estimated

78
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,840
that the known number of bugs in a car

79
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,190
that ships out roughly 10,000 okay

80
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,359
because you know what it's like you have

81
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:37,819
a product release date and you have bugs

82
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,169
and some of them you fix and some of

83
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:40,880
them you don't and some of them you fix

84
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,480
later so about ten thousand bucks in a

85
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,000
car that you buy brand new like we say

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,450
in Israel with the nylon wrapping okay

87
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,859
but from talks that we've had in the

88
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:53,780
industry it is estimated that the number

89
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,599
of unknown bugs might be five times

90
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,849
higher than that okay bug that the

91
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:01,010
manufacturers are not aware of and will

92
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,190
later be found by researchers or anybody

93
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:08,720
right so that's a lot of stuff okay now

94
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,769
if you ask the people to write that code

95
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:13,940
okay three years ago there was a nice

96
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,810
survey asking software development

97
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,048
people in car companies about you know

98
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:22,909
code security did they think their code

99
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:23,960
was secure was there

100
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,830
company aware of it so only 41% said

101
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,410
secure software is a priority for my

102
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,419
company and that's the people that make

103
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:34,669
the cars right it's not people like me

104
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:36,530
who stand on a stage and you know maybe

105
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,210
I what I say is my opinion these are the

106
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,660
people that work there and 69% said that

107
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,340
I believe that securing the applications

108
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,099
needed is difficult or very difficult so

109
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:47,990
they know that that's not that's not

110
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,780
even the worst thing when asked I

111
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,849
believe that automakers are as

112
00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:54,199
knowledgeable about secure software

113
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,660
development as our other industries a

114
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,259
whopping 72% said that no so even the

115
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,849
people that write the code for the cars

116
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:05,960
admit that it's difficult and they don't

117
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,400
know as much about security as they

118
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,870
would like to know and maybe the

119
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,060
companies that make the products they're

120
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,729
not all that security aware right this

121
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:15,199
is this is three years ago the numbers

122
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,000
are probably a little bit better now but

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,919
this comes from the people that make the

124
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:23,780
cars ECU's is the electronic control

125
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,780
unit it's the one of the devices that is

126
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,520
inside the car it used to be called

127
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,289
engine control unit and then it became

128
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,659
electronic control unit and every little

129
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,130
thing that your car does every little

130
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,630
functionality is controlled by one of

131
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,539
these devices this is from the internet

132
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,180
this is what a car looked like about a

133
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,099
decade ago a little bit more even

134
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:46,250
2006 each one of these boxes does

135
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,110
something in your car it can be a sensor

136
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,419
it can be an actuator it can be a

137
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:53,000
computer that calculates the if you're

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,909
skidding and then starts the ABS it can

139
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:58,310
be the crash control the ABS every one

140
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,199
of those is an ECU and you can already

141
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:03,050
see that 12 years ago you had about I

142
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,539
can tell you about 60 different ECU's

143
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:09,080
right and each one of them has code but

144
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,490
this and I'm sorry for the lack of

145
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,460
details but this is one of our customers

146
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,590
gave us permission to use this

147
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,080
information under restrictions this is

148
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,380
an estimation of what the same map looks

149
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,500
in a brand new car the grit gets rolled

150
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,060
out today right we have close to 200

151
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,260
different ECU's in various arrangements

152
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,670
so car is also complex in the

153
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,880
term that it has a very big collection

154
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,500
of different parts and they only to work

155
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,020
with each other now it's true not all of

156
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,250
them are as complex as sophisticated on

157
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,170
one end of the scale you can find this

158
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,940
this is called the TPMS tire pressure

159
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,890
measurement system and that's the little

160
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,530
thing that when you lose tire pressure

161
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,800
there's a little yellow you know light

162
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,440
on your panel okay

163
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,520
still by the way this thing is an IOT

164
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,280
device with firmware and a transceiver

165
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,330
it can transmit and receive okay so even

166
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,480
this little thing is still an IOT device

167
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,820
with connectivity on the far end of the

168
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,000
scale you have the infotainment or the

169
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,880
head unit or other names for that and we

170
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,940
all know that these are multi core multi

171
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,030
CPU computers full-fledged like a laptop

172
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,530
like a tablet they run Linux or Android

173
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,220
and they have a lot of connectivity and

174
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,070
in many times they're connected to the

175
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,170
Internet right so that's a whole new

176
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,010
different story now as far as networks

177
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,240
ago at home you have one it's the

178
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,520
Internet and if you have a wireless then

179
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,700
it's another one but basically that's it

180
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,110
and there are more or less even the same

181
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,440
protocol but a car has a large number of

182
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,990
different protocols because some of them

183
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,620
have an emphasis on latency for example

184
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,530
if you crash your car then it should

185
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,570
take a few microseconds before the

186
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,790
decision is made to open the the airbag

187
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,970
whereas if you're driving in Reverse

188
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,130
thank you and you're looking at the

189
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,380
camera then you know if it takes 100

190
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,360
millisecond you're a human being you're

191
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,320
not gonna pay attention right so you

192
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,750
have up to up to six different kinds of

193
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,350
networks including by the way Ethernet

194
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,000
which is now moving into cars because

195
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,130
it's very useful it can transfer a law a

196
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,160
large large amounts of data relatively

197
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,000
quickly right now this is the canvas

198
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,529
canvas the controller area

199
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:54,829
work is the dominant protocol and the

200
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:57,350
wiring in your car in the beginning it

201
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,839
was almost just this and then things

202
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,810
were added today this is still the most

203
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,810
common bus and you know you don't need

204
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,970
to jump into the this whole thing but

205
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,220
I'll just tell you that this arbitration

206
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,670
field serves two purposes one it it is

207
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,040
sort of the user ID when you send a

208
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,120
message you say hello my user ID is 1 2

209
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,759
3 but this number has significance the

210
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,309
lower the number the higher the priority

211
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:28,730
so if let's say someone who is priority

212
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,920
3 speaking and I have an urgent message

213
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,410
in my priorities 1 then they will stop

214
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,970
transmitting and then I will transmit

215
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,790
but here's the thing

216
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,999
canvas has no security whatsoever there

217
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:43,730
is no form of authentication that lets

218
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,470
you know that if someone just sent a

219
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,420
message on the bus claiming that they

220
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,649
were ID 1 that they are in fact ID 1 so

221
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:52,999
if you put all these two users on the

222
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:54,559
same bus what we call a flat

223
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,750
architecture which you know as IT people

224
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,170
we know it's bad ID security same here I

225
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,680
could pretend to be any ECU on the bus

226
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,100
and no one could know the better now a

227
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,040
car also takes a long time to make it's

228
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,350
not just with a lot of parts a lot of

229
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,120
networks and a lot of code it takes

230
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,589
roughly 5 years between someone starts

231
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:21,069
design the car and until it rolls out a

232
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:24,139
lot of processes to go a lot of checks

233
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:26,120
that you have to make like I said it's a

234
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,980
big outsourcing project and there's also

235
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,870
a lot of regulation you can't just do

236
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,699
whatever you want you have read you a

237
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,860
regulation for software and for hardware

238
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,509
and how things are done and built and

239
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,509
it's different in some countries so this

240
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:40,069
makes the whole thing again a very

241
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:44,029
complex product and it's not enough that

242
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:47,209
it's complex let's look at how long it

243
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:49,399
has to run when you buy a cellphone

244
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,129
today then let's assume you didn't drop

245
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:54,470
and break it like half of us do it'll

246
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,360
last or you will use it more or less

247
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,040
about a year and a half before you

248
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,920
retire it it's not like the old Nokia's

249
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,230
you could no hammer nails with that it

250
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,520
would last forever

251
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,589
battery for six days no no today you

252
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:09,410
have an iPhone within a year and a half

253
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,070
to slow the battery's dead whatever if

254
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,170
you look at a computer then it's

255
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,870
slightly more right you can keep used to

256
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,420
keep using the same computer five six

257
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,220
maybe seven years depending on what you

258
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,440
do but that's a reasonable amount of

259
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,950
time and it gets updated but a car you

260
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,339
buy a car that car will stay about 15

261
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:33,709
years on the road and it will probably

262
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:35,990
change owners so you bought the car and

263
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,279
then somebody else is going to have the

264
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,510
car and then somebody else is going to

265
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,370
have the car and when they make that

266
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,200
product it needs to be really really

267
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,330
good because it needs to last fifteen

268
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,240
years after being released to the market

269
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,850
so that's a lot of requirement and what

270
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,980
happens if you have a problem it's not

271
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,750
like Windows that you can have you know

272
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,680
remote update with the exception of one

273
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,209
or two vendors that allow remote

274
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:01,730
software update all the vendors if they

275
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,380
need to fix something you have to go

276
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,390
back to the shop with your car so you

277
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,420
lose time maybe even money the car shop

278
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,209
loses time because instead of fixing

279
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:13,399
people people's cars and charging them

280
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,410
they now have to replace something

281
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,600
that's not even their problem and of

282
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,040
course the vendor needs to pay for all

283
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,480
that and it's a big thing a big thing

284
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,260
now let's look at the thing as an

285
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,240
attacker when you look at it at a target

286
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,120
you're looking at attack vectors when we

287
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,820
look at cars anything that connects the

288
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,270
car to the outside world anything at all

289
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:42,260
is an attack vector and it goes from GPS

290
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,079
right which is yes it's only passive but

291
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:47,930
there have already been demonstrated GPS

292
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,839
spoofing attacks to the level of

293
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,270
controlling your navigation software

294
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,360
it's been done remote keyless entry a

295
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,279
research which is published I think last

296
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:01,070
month about the team from Belgium that

297
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,490
managed to crack and clone the key for

298
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,070
Tesla okay

299
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,899
vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to

300
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:10,579
infrastructure communicating with the

301
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:11,560
outside world

302
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,779
onboard onboard diagnostics it's a

303
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:16,400
little port that you have in the car to

304
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,770
connect diagnostic

305
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,130
tire pressure measurement again supply

306
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,110
chain attack this just came back to the

307
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,990
news yesterday with the Chinese thing

308
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,190
power line communication if you cars

309
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,200
electric when you plug it in there's

310
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,060
data running there you need to identify

311
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,340
yourself and get charged and all that

312
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,470
and then there's the infotainment as I

313
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,970
said before the entertainment in itself

314
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,280
is a full-fledged computer it has

315
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,690
everything you would have in a normal

316
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,780
computer and that brings a lot more

317
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,720
attack vectors right some of them have

318
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,150
been in fact exploited by people in this

319
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,700
room which I will later mention right

320
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,650
Wi-Fi USB Android apps SD card

321
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:00,860
everything is an attack vector now the

322
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,440
biggest problem that we are seeing is

323
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,320
that and you see that pretty much every

324
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,750
other product the market is rushing to

325
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,420
connect things because it's cool it's

326
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,600
cool you have connectivity it's cool you

327
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,480
can sell it to people and let's face it

328
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,090
security put aside usability it's really

329
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,010
nice I mean not necessarily your

330
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,690
microwave oven I don't know what Amazon

331
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,400
is doing there but if you have stuff

332
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,630
that's connected to the Internet and you

333
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,370
can control it from other places or

334
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,560
maybe queried from your phone you know

335
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,970
what's going on like with your air

336
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,150
conditioning it's really nice but their

337
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,760
first connecting and only later trying

338
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,710
to see ok what are the implications and

339
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,000
that is a problem

340
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,089
now other thing that I told you is

341
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:45,620
theoretical yeah I said that there is a

342
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,950
an attack on the USB but is it just

343
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,780
theoretical because in the lab

344
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,850
everything is possible no I'm going to

345
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,870
share a few stories war stories of

346
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,160
research that has been already done and

347
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,750
published and you will see that pretty

348
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,010
much no one is immune

349
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,740
all the big manufacturers have already

350
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,610
been hacked one way or another academia

351
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,410
I started looking at hacking cars as

352
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,790
back as 14 years ago you can see this

353
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,250
security in automotive bus systems this

354
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,820
is from 2004 all the way to a research

355
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,400
from this year about electric cars and

356
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,290
what sort of attack you can do if you

357
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,890
drain their battery out but the thing

358
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,390
that changed everything was these two

359
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,220
guys Chris and Charlie

360
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,360
in a chain of two researchers published

361
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,790
a year apart this one in 2014 and this

362
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,310
one in 2015 they showed that it was

363
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,640
possible to remotely take over a car

364
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,860
from the internet without any previous

365
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,930
contact with the car and that changed

366
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,580
everything the industry started paying

367
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,150
attention

368
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,890
other researchers started paying

369
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,360
attention and saying oh this is

370
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,090
interesting let's do that where is the

371
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:03,670
Stefan you here yeah so this guy here

372
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,200
show that it's not just about hacking

373
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,150
car and taking control because people

374
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,810
like to get this very narrow version of

375
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,020
what the risks are Stefan and Gabriel

376
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,600
showed that your privacy is also at risk

377
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,300
they found that a car when you sync your

378
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,640
phone to it the car takes all your

379
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,320
information from the phone your messages

380
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,140
your contacts your call lists and it

381
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,540
stays there what if it's a if it's a

382
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,510
rental car do you remember to disconnect

383
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,640
your phone from the rental car and you

384
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,560
erase your information if you don't then

385
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,060
your information is still there and

386
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,710
that's a big problem and that was before

387
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,770
GDP are now it's serious and then Tesla

388
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,480
came out and Tesla that's super cool

389
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,060
it's an electric car the most high-tech

390
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,810
car and of course it attracted attention

391
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,140
this research was published in 2016 I

392
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,680
think hacking the Tesla Model S these

393
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,990
guys basically took the car apart and

394
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,510
look for physical access so they managed

395
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,339
to get some control they found some

396
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,199
problems but again they had physical

397
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,760
access and then 2016 these guys that I

398
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,439
think maybe some of them are in the

399
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:13,939
conference because Tencent is in the

400
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:17,959
conference they actually managed to show

401
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,230
full remote control of a Tesla car but

402
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,810
again it's not just about taking control

403
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,300
of the car because hacking cars is

404
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,940
difficult this Norwegian company said

405
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,440
something else they said well if you

406
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,480
have a Tesla and you have the app on

407
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,430
your phone then I can just hack your

408
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,620
phone and then steal your car and they

409
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,660
did that so it wasn't even a problem

410
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,970
with the car as much as it was with the

411
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,550
trust that the car was putting into the

412
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,620
phone right

413
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,350
this team from the Netherland I think it

414
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,049
was showed repeating problems that have

415
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:52,970
already been found in other systems in

416
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,160
the infotainment system of harman that

417
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,220
was found to be now D and V W same

418
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,980
problems open ports and shares and a lot

419
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,929
of problems that were already reported

420
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:05,090
in other places and then again the same

421
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,130
team that hacked a Tesla did the same

422
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,470
thing of BMW and the same problems keep

423
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,480
coming up again and again so this is no

424
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,820
longer theoretical now there are rumors

425
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,740
in the industry and these are just

426
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,400
rumors

427
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,010
that there was a hack in the wild the

428
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,260
got caught and it was silenced I don't

429
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,850
have any additional information on that

430
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,919
if you have it if you're willing to

431
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:27,740
share I'd love to hear it I won't change

432
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,780
my presentation but there's a rumor that

433
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,150
this is already happening now just to

434
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,130
give you a perspective one of the things

435
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,809
that Argos the company are working in

436
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:39,799
does is pen testing service we've had a

437
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:43,580
hundred percent success okay there

438
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,230
hasn't been a single project that we

439
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:48,020
said sorry it can't be done this gives

440
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,700
you a scale this is not ninety nine this

441
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,250
is 100% success rate now you don't need

442
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,799
special tools you can buy this dongle

443
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,809
for about eight and a half dollars on

444
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:59,330
internet and connect it to your obd2

445
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,429
port in your own car and you can start

446
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:03,200
seeing stuff you can see the agnostic

447
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,590
information you can see error codes you

448
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,440
can change stuff and maybe you know what

449
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,640
you doing and maybe you don't know what

450
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,160
you're doing but now every person for a

451
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,860
box has an interface into changing

452
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,160
things in the car and while there are

453
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,630
some standards for let's say secure

454
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,370
onboard communication the seco see

455
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,650
they're not always implemented and

456
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,630
sometimes even if they are implemented

457
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,570
they're implemented either partially or

458
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,429
incorrectly so even though there are

459
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:37,040
some solutions it's still not as good as

460
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,160
we want it to be so now okay we've seen

461
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,830
that a car is a complex product we

462
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,080
understand why it's going to have a lot

463
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,590
of bugs right we've seen that these bars

464
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,840
have been researched and exploited so

465
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,880
this is not theoretical and the question

466
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,080
is what can we do if we look back on

467
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,920
these things and try to

468
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,900
draw conclusions we will see a few

469
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,600
things we have published research that

470
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,820
shows trivial problems recurring time

471
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,820
and again same problem now you would

472
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,610
think that if a research on BMW shows

473
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,370
something in let's say 2016 then you

474
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,170
should not be having the same problem in

475
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,960
another car in 2017 but it is this is

476
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,900
what we see we have old an unpatched

477
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,950
software rolling into new cars and part

478
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,420
of it of course is because you have to

479
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,460
meet regulations so you have to have a

480
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,280
lot of tests and these tests were

481
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,990
performed I don't know three years ago

482
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,730
because it takes five years to make a

483
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,920
car so you have outdated software

484
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,980
rolling out with cars all the time now

485
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,350
it's not always you know code execution

486
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,410
or zero day sometimes these are logical

487
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,230
vulnerabilities maybe there is an access

488
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,910
that doesn't need to be there

489
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,280
Stefan's research show that you can just

490
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,220
use the USB drive and it gets Oda

491
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,530
mounted and then you can just run shell

492
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,380
so that's not remote code execution or

493
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,440
some zero-day basic stuff open ports

494
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,940
that are still there and shouldn't be

495
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,190
there right

496
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,470
so not everything requires top-notch

497
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,690
research or exploits and basically you

498
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,000
can be a script Kitty and have enough

499
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,770
ability and tools to hack a car now it's

500
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,570
already been spoken of in this

501
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,280
conference about cybercrime and the

502
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,830
economics of it let's look about the

503
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,350
cost of operation and compare automotive

504
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,820
to the IT security world that we're

505
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,860
already familiar with to find

506
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,020
vulnerability in the IT security world

507
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,080
well it's trivial and up it depends on

508
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,550
the platform sometimes it's very easy

509
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:40,790
sometimes it's not very easy it is said

510
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,160
that because of all the mitigations that

511
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,770
the IT security world has been already

512
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,230
putting into effect then now if some

513
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,360
time if a few years ago it took you a

514
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,790
few hours - maybe a day to find an

515
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,130
exploit a vulnerability today it can

516
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,810
take you a few weeks and sometimes it

517
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,880
will even require a chain of

518
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,020
vulnerabilities but in the automotive

519
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,610
some of them are a lot easier than

520
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,800
others so at least for finding

521
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,510
vulnerabilities there are more or less

522
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,919
the same but the exploitation

523
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,019
different because the automotive world

524
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:17,549
has a lot less if any mitigations so

525
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:19,919
where today it's becoming harder to

526
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,269
exploit on the IT security world

527
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:23,129
exploiting a vulnerability that you

528
00:22:23,129 --> 00:22:25,379
found in car is a lot simpler and that

529
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:28,139
is the return on investment let's say

530
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:31,109
you do that how much can you get back so

531
00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:33,779
in the IT security world right the

532
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:35,940
problem of monetization is solved we

533
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,850
have cyber crime crime as a service you

534
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,350
can make money out of pretty much

535
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,450
anything from credit card information

536
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,269
identity information a hijacking

537
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:48,299
bandwidth CPU storage whatever you want

538
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:50,820
it's all you know how to do that now

539
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,090
with automotive with the exception of

540
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,619
ransomware and crypto war which are

541
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:58,529
probably platform agnostic there is no

542
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:01,700
good way to monetize on hacking a car

543
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,220
right not not a good way to do that and

544
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,980
even if you do find a way if you try if

545
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,049
you look at the scale so again

546
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:11,820
hacking at scale in the IT security

547
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,239
world also solve problem with crime as a

548
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:17,399
service you just buy a botnet that

549
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:19,739
botnet generates infections and then

550
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:21,690
you're done you can get a few thousand

551
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,820
infections for I don't know a few dozens

552
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,249
of dollars but hacking cars at scale has

553
00:23:29,249 --> 00:23:31,289
been proven in research right Christian

554
00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:33,450
Charlie showed in fact their research

555
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,009
they estimated that they could hack

556
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:36,840
about between three and four hundred

557
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,409
thousand cars but the recall was 1.2

558
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:43,350
million ok so that shows you this is

559
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,840
actual scale but we haven't witnessed

560
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,659
any attacks on cars that weren't at

561
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,059
scale now at this point usually someone

562
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:52,739
raises their hands and says no but there

563
00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:55,470
was this in in the UK some car thieves

564
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:00,359
were using RFC relays in stealing 4

565
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:03,330
million quid worth of cars well maybe

566
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,609
for you and I 4 million pounds are a lot

567
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:08,399
of money but that's not scale ok if you

568
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:10,049
look back at Chris's chart at Chris and

569
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:13,440
Charlie's research 1.2 million cars that

570
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,799
is scale and this is actually our luck

571
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,690
the inability to hack cars at scale

572
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,310
makes it not a profitable business

573
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,470
for cybercrime but we are actually

574
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,120
looking at the tipping point because

575
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,180
it's not gonna stay like this for long

576
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,520
the cybercrime which is the I guess you

577
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,580
could call it the growth engine for

578
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,700
hacking and defenses and mitigations be

579
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,710
sitting on the fence and just looking at

580
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,760
us current type of connectivity prevents

581
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,710
the Texas scale different cars use

582
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,690
different protocols some are connected

583
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,610
in one way and some in the other you

584
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,370
have multiple different standards

585
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,900
vendors use different things it's not

586
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,870
easy to do it at scale and the limited

587
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,660
monetization once again it's not a good

588
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,030
business but this is all changing its

589
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,160
changing because you start to have

590
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,440
connected cars so they're all going to

591
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,040
have to speak the same language

592
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,570
standardization is improving autonomous

593
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,150
vehicles will create the ability to

594
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,800
monetize on car because if it's

595
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,750
autonomous and I take over it then I can

596
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,790
do things with it so now there is a new

597
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,010
monetization solution for cars which we

598
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,200
don't have today right and there is

599
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,970
something called ECU consolidation if

600
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,650
today you have a bunch of different

601
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,990
issues there they want to put them all

602
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,210
into one big computer that will perform

603
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,890
many many functions and then if you take

604
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,630
over that computer it's like taking over

605
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,210
the hypervisor and then you know taking

606
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,810
over all the virtual machines so I

607
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,610
reminding you this is what the network

608
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,160
looks in a car this is like an SMB small

609
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,500
and medium business if you take a law

610
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,420
firm or something this is about as

611
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,850
complicated as their network is right

612
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,770
and you have to treat it as such because

613
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,690
they probably have an IT security guy

614
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,360
maybe they have a CIS so maybe it's just

615
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,800
the IT guy and they told him to do

616
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,570
security but someone is paying attention

617
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,820
but in cars we don't have that now the

618
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,820
solutions already exist in the IT

619
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,450
security world so what we need to do is

620
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,490
adopt them migrate them we can take them

621
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,370
as is you can't just take some firewall

622
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,620
from checkpoint and just put it in the

623
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,690
car it doesn't work like that you need

624
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,000
to make the adaptations but the problems

625
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,520
are identical so the principles to solve

626
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,070
them are identical as well and the way

627
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,460
we look at it the first stage is

628
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,240
prevention you need to be able to

629
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,760
prevent as much as you can make it

630
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,870
harder to hack the

631
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,960
and then because hackers will always

632
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,409
succeed that's the rule of nature you

633
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:45,669
have to understand that you are being

634
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:47,799
hacked and the next thing is you have to

635
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:50,380
be able to act on it whether it is to

636
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,020
report it back to fix maybe send a

637
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,770
remote update because otherwise it's a

638
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,330
car that's being hacked and no one can

639
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,419
do anything now we talk about security

640
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,880
by design and it's easy to say security

641
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,200
by design but if you don't have a

642
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,140
security person doing that security by

643
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,760
design then you don't get as much

644
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,529
security as you think because it takes a

645
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:15,760
security person to understand and apply

646
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,929
the the principles of security and it's

647
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,340
okay to take a service if you don't have

648
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,080
someone that does your own security or

649
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,510
that can do security by design for you

650
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,279
then you get somebody else to do that

651
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,440
and the last hope that we have is

652
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,750
legislation in Europe and the United

653
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,880
States there is legislation now that is

654
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,649
starting to change things it's going to

655
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:37,390
force the manufacturers to be more

656
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,659
secure and it will try to deter hackers

657
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,679
by introducing penalties but it's too

658
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:50,140
early to say so summing up cars are

659
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,240
complex products with networks that are

660
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,610
as complicated as a little business and

661
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,559
they need to be treated as such and the

662
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,149
tools to do that are already there

663
00:27:58,149 --> 00:28:00,279
we just need to migrate them make

664
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:03,039
adaptations and we're good but there is

665
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,320
no silver bullet okay there's no one

666
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,000
thing that will solve your problem if

667
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,100
any company ever tells you my solution

668
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,830
will solve prevent all hacking so

669
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,480
something is wrong don't do that it has

670
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,700
to be layered security you have to

671
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,720
detect you have to respond okay and we

672
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,659
are that's the the image that I thought

673
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,789
I felt that we is the automotive

674
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:26,770
security industry are the little kid

675
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:29,100
with the finger in the dike were by

676
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,559
extending this gap by keeping hacking

677
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,980
cars at scale not at reach where I'm

678
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,049
making it somewhere that we're not there

679
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,820
yet this is how we're going to protect

680
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,340
ourselves because if we don't do that if

681
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,830
car hacking at scale becomes possible

682
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,679
then the floodgates will open cybercrime

683
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,750
will dive in then we will have a lot

684
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,650
more attacks people start

685
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,600
being heard and we will enter this arms

686
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,640
race which you already know from the

687
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,930
security world thank you

688
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,990
so we
