1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
please help me welcome Filip Kafka from

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:12,780
ESET thank you hello everybody I'm going

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,480
to speak about the company which might

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,170
be closer than you actually think so

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,300
when companies get hacked they tend to

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,359
recover but what happens when your

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,580
company gets hacked and all your

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,210
products become unusable

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,860
that is the hacking team case so let's

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,640
take a look

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,219
I guess the company doesn't need any

12
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,260
introduction here the company was

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,879
developing spy ver and selling to

14
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,379
governments as law enforcement tools the

15
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,270
security community didn't know which spy

16
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,390
ver they were developing until 2012 when

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,980
researchers from dr. web attributed the

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,260
spider in the wild to the hacking team

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,210
company in 2014 it was revealed by a

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,880
citizen lab that company sells their

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,189
products to oppressive regimes which are

22
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:09,990
misusing them against political

23
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,360
dissidents journalists and other similar

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,670
people as you can see on the screen it

25
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,860
is not that unusual for offensive

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,020
companies to sell to oppressive regimes

27
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,909
we will not cover this aspect of the

28
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,310
topic we will focus on technical details

29
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,229
but if you are interested I recommend

30
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,259
you to stay here in this room after the

31
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,960
birth after the presentation as citizen

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,540
lab will speak about it in 2015

33
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,890
ironically the company got hacked I

34
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,409
guess that everyone here remembers the

35
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,899
major data breach when everything lived

36
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,680
public the leak included five zero day

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,740
exploits it also included email this one

38
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,280
was funny written by our CEO he was

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,799
laughing at finish early competitor when

40
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,719
they got hacked one year earlier the

41
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,030
legal also includes their flagship

42
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,610
product called remote control system or

43
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,949
also gal alone as you can see they had

44
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,460
spy ver for Chrome

45
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,740
tuturro they also had has fiber for

46
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,320
mobile phones and they were also

47
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,160
developing the ufi rootkit this was the

48
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,100
first UEFA rootkit developed in a

49
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,180
malware context not as proof of concept

50
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,030
by security researchers although we

51
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,220
didn't see the UFA rootkit in the wild

52
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,370
and of course in order to install this

53
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,160
your file root give you either needed a

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,960
physical access to the computer or

55
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:48,260
exploit a film vulnerability here you

56
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,440
can see a part of the license scheme of

57
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,650
the remote control system it basically

58
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,960
also describes an order from their

59
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,000
customer we can see here that this

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,800
customer both agents for I mean like

61
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,580
spider for computer for Windows he did

62
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,360
not buy spider for OSX and Linux

63
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,560
he bought spider for Android and he also

64
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,340
bought access to exploit portal so as

65
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,410
you can see the business model is as any

66
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,510
other their customers can choose what

67
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,670
they want to buy how much they want to

68
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,200
buy since the league also included the

69
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,150
source code and the Builder and the

70
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,120
spider it comes as a no surprise beside

71
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,090
the criminals started to reuse the

72
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,340
leaked spider this was the case with

73
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,910
Callisto group reported by f-secure when

74
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,610
some cyber criminals grabbed to the

75
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,280
spider from the leaked and started to

76
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,910
reuse it you know and now it starts to

77
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,630
be interesting there started to appear

78
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,300
new activity about hacking team

79
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,580
it started with hacking team CEO

80
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:07,340
claiming that yes we suffered major data

81
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,940
breach but we are going on we are still

82
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,830
developing the products and we are still

83
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:18,140
in business later it was reported by La

84
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,298
Stampa that hacking team received

85
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:22,610
fundings by a mysterious investor and

86
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,010
later motherboard revealed that these

87
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,360
mysterious investor

88
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,680
has some ties to Saudi government very

89
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,870
recently el diario reported that hacking

90
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,870
team sold licenses and the spy ver to

91
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,210
Mexico's government in 2017 so from non

92
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,710
technical point of view would really

93
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,620
start it really appeared like the

94
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,620
company wanted to recover and is still

95
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,169
in business but make sense because they

96
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,569
were in a very prominent business but

97
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:59,569
there was no technical report no

98
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:02,419
technical research about their new

99
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:05,180
activities that's why we started

100
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,849
research in the beginning we exchanged

101
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,740
some technical information with citizen

102
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,680
lab they showed us modified hacking team

103
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,939
samples being used in 2016 and 17 and

104
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:18,889
then we together discovered a new

105
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:22,039
modified hacking team sample being used

106
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:26,509
in 2018 so what do we know about about

107
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:30,800
the spider these spider names suggests

108
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,979
that spearfishing infection vector was

109
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:37,580
used the first two spider names were

110
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,520
used to target high profiles such as

111
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,219
diplomats and the first one was used to

112
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:46,400
target two ambassadors in an African

113
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,318
country it came from this email address

114
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:55,039
the spider has several stages first

115
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,439
stage is called by hacking team

116
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,589
developers Scout the second is soldier

117
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:03,349
or elite the elite is a premium version

118
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:06,050
of the spider advanced and premium so it

119
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,360
depends whether their customer both the

120
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,250
elite or not so they can use it or not

121
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,139
however samples are packed with VM

122
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:17,539
product so we had to unpack them Oh

123
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:20,060
unfortunately we don't have time to show

124
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,039
you how we unpacked the unprotected

125
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:24,650
spider but if you are interested we

126
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,449
rolled it into the vb paper into the

127
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:28,759
brochure so if you are interested in

128
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,560
unpacking or vm product please check our

129
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,589
paper Scout it is first staged very

130
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:38,659
simple spider which is designed to steal

131
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:39,660
some basic information

132
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,780
from the system from the computer report

133
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,510
to C&C server and download the second

134
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:49,140
stage second stage the soldier is quite

135
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,680
good spy ver it is very well designed it

136
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,590
has proper memory and memory management

137
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,460
error handling and so on let's talk

138
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,610
about the actual payload it can steal

139
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,860
various information as you can see from

140
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,040
social networks also files from Google

141
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,030
Drive and also location it can grab an

142
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,080
extract location of the photo on

143
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,590
Facebook if there is some available some

144
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,430
other functionality is self-explanatory

145
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,910
but I will explain geolocation it

146
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,730
collects information from Wi-Fi networks

147
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,940
available around eBay and based on it it

148
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,280
tries to determine the location of the

149
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,780
victim URLs it can steal various

150
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,160
information from popular web browsers

151
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,750
like bookmarks save data history and so

152
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,860
on we saw there very interesting and

153
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,660
probably unique functionality which we

154
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,180
didn't see before it can also change a

155
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,110
configuration in tor browser so you know

156
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,840
even if the victim will clean the

157
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,870
machine from the spider the changed

158
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,260
configuration in tor browser remains so

159
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,180
this helps the attacker to track the

160
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,230
victim even better this was also in the

161
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,050
leak the new functionality which was not

162
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,990
in the leaked soldier is that it can

163
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,750
also record Skype calls capture keeps

164
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,130
keystrokes and monitor Mouse it means

165
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,050
that it can take a screenshot on a mouse

166
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,110
click this functionality actually was in

167
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,110
the leak but not in soldier it was in

168
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,750
elite in the premium agent so they just

169
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,429
moved it from elite to the soldier agent

170
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,750
completely new is scheduling an

171
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,430
installation it means that malware

172
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,430
operator can choose when the malware

173
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,610
will uninstall from the system and so

174
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,140
the whole operation will terminate

175
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,380
this is the example of configuration

176
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,300
which is embedded in the binary here we

177
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,000
can see that this customer for example I

178
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,040
can swim here maybe not but you can read

179
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,980
it the dis customer choose taking

180
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,350
screenshots every two minutes once the

181
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,140
customer behind the agent they can

182
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,810
choose their configuration up to their

183
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:25,110
choice so as you can see the spider is

184
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,209
in active development there are few

185
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:30,750
modifications the question is who is

186
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,240
developing the spider some cyber

187
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,240
criminals like Callisto group or are we

188
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,399
really looking at the rise of the

189
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:44,550
Phoenix based on the artifacts which we

190
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,769
as a malware researchers were able to

191
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:49,769
analyze we tried to answer the question

192
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:52,649
we analyzed code patterns development

193
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:55,320
habits and we wanted to answer this

194
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,050
question while keeping in mind possible

195
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,089
false flags so now let's compare the

196
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:05,160
modified hacking team sample the most

197
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,620
recent one with the leaked wanna when

198
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,990
Scout installed on system before the

199
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,990
leap it increased its size to four

200
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,440
megabytes after the leak the modified

201
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,750
hacking team sample I have this constant

202
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,310
a constant changed to six megabytes

203
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,560
before the leap I'm sorry and skip one

204
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,680
slide before the leak the Scout was

205
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,079
generating random numbers by rank

206
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,660
function after the leak they changed

207
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,899
this function to Microsoft Windows API

208
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:45,420
function crypt join random before the

209
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,630
leak the Scout had to hit a my sleep

210
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,360
function why am i slick function because

211
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,640
some send boxes are fetching sleep in

212
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,320
those API functions so if the mother

213
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,899
really wants to sleep they implement it

214
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,529
my sleep function after the lead indeed

215
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:05,209
this function is changed

216
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,120
so these parts of the code are changed

217
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,490
like it is very strange the guys behind

218
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,290
these are changing these parts of the

219
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,740
code if somebody was just the reusing

220
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,180
the leap source code they wouldn't

221
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,340
change my sleep function or random

222
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,190
number generation in generation so it

223
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,230
started to appear what we really

224
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,510
suspected that hacking team developers

225
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,000
are behind this because if somebody was

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,070
just reusing the lead source code they

227
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,950
would add some functionality or change

228
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:40,060
more important parts of the code not my

229
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,950
sleep function or random number

230
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:47,110
generation the spider had a valid

231
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,870
digital certificate at that time digital

232
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,900
certificates are not that unusual

233
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,790
inspirer we have seen some in the past

234
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,880
but usually we have seen malware signed

235
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,520
beaver certificate which was issued by

236
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,460
Commodore but this one was issued by

237
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,530
tauten and the doubt is a certification

238
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,780
Authority which verifies the entities

239
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,540
and they issued this certificate to a

240
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,690
cyber Ltd which is a London company a

241
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:18,220
real UK company signed a spider so we

242
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,010
checked all modified post hack hacking

243
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,900
tin samples and we extracted each those

244
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,930
certificates as you can see it started

245
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,650
with valerian embellishing Pangolin

246
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,050
sorry valid Valeria nobody she is a

247
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,590
co-founder of hacking team of course but

248
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,180
she's not stupid enough to sign a

249
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,840
spyware and sell to customers but this

250
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,110
sample had a private cnc set you know

251
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,090
that the cnc was within the local

252
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,640
network so it was only a testing case

253
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,410
but as she was testing the sample then

254
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,600
these three companies like megabit LED

255
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,870
audit and media are again certificates

256
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,180
issued by tout a so real moscow

257
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,900
companies

258
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:06,989
there is a lot of information of this

259
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:09,359
slide so I will explain reanalyzed

260
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:12,600
together more than 40 post HEC modified

261
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,999
hacking team samples and we extracted

262
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:18,779
important information from it as you can

263
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,519
see on the left there is a compilation

264
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,399
time stamp this compilation time stamp

265
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,999
is real it is genuine not faked how do

266
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:31,230
we know because every time after like

267
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,179
every time we have seen the spider in

268
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,419
the wild after few weeks or sometimes

269
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:39,769
days after the compilation time stamp

270
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:43,829
mm-hmm I can see that you can't see the

271
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:46,679
whole picture so the first column is

272
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:50,309
compilation time stamp on the right you

273
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:52,350
can see digital certificates which were

274
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:57,720
used to sign the spider and in the

275
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,809
middle you can see the versions of the

276
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:04,290
scout and soldier which are under that

277
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,429
which are in the binary now let's focus

278
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:12,629
on the pre hack time so before the

279
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:16,199
league the company was the company was

280
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:18,660
pushing new updates of the spider every

281
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,850
few months and sometimes every few weeks

282
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,459
you know every few month months

283
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:26,279
newspaper new version of the spider

284
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,949
appeared and they were also putting

285
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:33,959
digital certificates there in 2015 the

286
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:37,249
company was hyped and the most recent

287
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:40,529
spyware which leaked that time was the

288
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:43,129
version 14 and as you can see in the red

289
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:47,549
version 14 was reused by kalisto group

290
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:49,649
which I mentioned in the beginning that

291
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:52,470
is the version which cybercriminals took

292
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,119
from the league and they started to

293
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:59,279
reusing it but the other samples after

294
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,939
the heck that is there are new modified

295
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:04,439
hacking team samples it started with

296
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:06,600
Valerie and Oba dashi and as you can see

297
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,660
again new version of the spider appears

298
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,269
every few weeks or every few months

299
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:14,200
so is it

300
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:21,310
see the versioning is very smooth this

301
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,100
is a screenshot of the remote control

302
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,070
system package from the leaked data as

303
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,490
you can see they had using they had been

304
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,490
using names of the applications with

305
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,520
icons of the application I'm talking

306
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,600
about this you can check it in

307
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,420
properties so the applications can have

308
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,730
an icon and description and on and so on

309
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,230
and they have been using these names

310
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,630
descriptions and icons from legitimate

311
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,260
applications right it was copied and

312
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,790
they had been regularly changing it so

313
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,770
for example this version of remote

314
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:00,700
control system included these names and

315
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,310
icons and and so on of the application

316
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,960
this is a string shot from the leaked

317
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,460
source code you can see here a history

318
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,480
of the export names for example remote

319
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,870
control system version 9.5 here had this

320
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,150
export name we can see here history they

321
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,910
had been regularly changing the names of

322
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,730
the exports the most recent one at the

323
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,680
time of the leap was this one

324
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,170
um it looks like the clicker doesn't

325
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,140
work anymore

326
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:52,529
can I have another one please I'm sorry

327
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,279
okay lords now so as you can see another

328
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:08,980
screenshot of the lead source code we

329
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,559
can see here again history of the user

330
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,500
agents basically they had been changing

331
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,199
the user agents every few versions of

332
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,089
the spy ver and we can see basically a

333
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:21,909
documentation a remote control system

334
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:25,599
version 9.5 included in this user agent

335
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,970
the most recent was this one they had

336
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,590
been regularly changing it and they were

337
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,440
they were referring to it as a crisis

338
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,419
procedure URL sing again screenshot of

339
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:38,649
the lead source code they had been

340
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:41,169
regularly changing the strings across

341
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:45,250
various versions so we extracted all

342
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,649
this data from every modified hacking

343
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:51,580
team sample and we found that again

344
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,100
these strings these export names are

345
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,909
being regularly changed again user

346
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:59,919
agents on the left you can see version

347
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,899
of the spider on the right you can see

348
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:04,029
user agent which is not that important

349
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:06,340
the important thing is that they are

350
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,370
regularly changing it every few versions

351
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,389
and new user agent appears remember

352
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:16,720
majority of the code is untouched is not

353
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,019
changed except these parts of the code

354
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:22,350
which had been regularly changed also

355
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,120
before the league it was a typical

356
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,460
hacking team development habit again

357
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,440
names of the applications with the icon

358
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,600
description and so on it is being

359
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:41,649
regularly changed the URL sync again the

360
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:43,510
crisis procedure which they had been

361
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,389
regularly changing it is changed in new

362
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:52,690
hacking team spider samples so wrapping

363
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,789
up the post hack modified of the post

364
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:57,000
hack findings it all started with

365
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,010
non-technical reports from the CEO

366
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,389
claiming that they are still in business

367
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:06,010
we found new modified hacking team

368
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,889
samples they had digital certificates it

369
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:10,600
started with valeriano bellusci which is

370
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,789
co-founder of hacking team certificates

371
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:13,380
our

372
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,930
are very common for hacking thing or

373
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,520
they had been common for hacking team

374
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,270
before the heck developers behind these

375
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,880
changed only few parts of the code and

376
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,530
in the reveal that they are very

377
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,960
familiar with the lead code of it if the

378
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,990
lead source code it really looked like

379
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,240
it is a regular maintenance of the code

380
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,800
the versioning of the span spyware was

381
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,410
very smooth as you could see there are

382
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:47,730
frequent changes in the in the code I

383
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,670
mean the crisis procedure and the places

384
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,770
which they had been regularly changing

385
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,850
before the leak

386
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,520
these changes are again in this modified

387
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,750
hacking team samples and they are again

388
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,780
masquerading the spyware with legitimate

389
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,380
applications like description names and

390
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:12,870
icon so this all with few other

391
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,090
evidences fully convinced us that

392
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,370
hacking team developers are behind this

393
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:23,670
new modified hacking team samples but

394
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:27,980
why did they do that I mean why did they

395
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,230
upgraded their old source code instead

396
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,910
of rewriting everything from the scratch

397
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,260
we have two hypotheses we have two

398
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,840
suggestions not a father-like proof or

399
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,330
or like fact but only hypothesis first

400
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,630
hypothesis is that you remember the

401
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,280
remote control system package it

402
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,290
included the sophisticated spider for

403
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,540
almost every platform it would be very

404
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,390
time consuming to rewrite everything

405
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,880
from scratch and from business point of

406
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,450
view time consuming means expensive the

407
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,200
second hypothesis is that it maybe

408
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,780
wasn't necessary I mean they achieved

409
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,410
the primary goal they avoided AV

410
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,260
detection by combination of VM protect

411
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,140
digital certificates descriptions of the

412
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,130
application so it was not necessary to

413
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,640
rewrite everything from the scratch so

414
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,290
from business point of view it was a

415
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,610
smart decision

416
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,550
we still didn't disclose everything but

417
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,070
we know about them basically we are

418
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:38,430
still keeping a track with them and very

419
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,460
few days ago and a few weeks ago we

420
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,350
detected a new hacking team activity

421
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,110
again new modified hacking teams by very

422
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,750
simple with new version is signed with a

423
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,890
new digital certificate I all I forgot

424
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,850
to say that we informed doughten about

425
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,710
this issue that their certificates are

426
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,770
used to to sign a spy ver and they

427
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,080
correctly revoked trust in those

428
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,270
certificates so we reported very

429
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,790
recently misuse of these certificates

430
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,850
and the revocation is in progress right

431
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:15,990
now so what is all means despite the

432
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,640
fact that hacking team is still in

433
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,410
business so we can track them because of

434
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,840
potential abuse of their products

435
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,810
because of potential new malicious

436
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,390
techniques because of maybe new 0 days

437
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:31,440
or ufi rootkit it is also interesting

438
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,640
that the company survive you know the

439
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,040
company's business model was based on

440
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,130
confidentiality it was based on the fact

441
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,100
that almost nobody knew about their

442
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,500
Spyder that almost nobody knew about

443
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,920
their customers so even if everything

444
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,780
lived public and they survived its kind

445
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:59,280
of interesting it also means that it is

446
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,320
big and evolving business you can see

447
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,040
new customers and these companies are

448
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,500
growing and so we when they have a big

449
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,690
budget they can buy their own

450
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,810
certificates for quality legitimate

451
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,940
companies so they can cover their

452
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,870
operations pretty well ok thank you very

453
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,709
much for attention
