6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,780
at Sophos is going to talk fake News

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,369
incorporated so take it away Andrew

8
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:18,990
thank you

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,550
so I'm Andrew Branham principal

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,310
researcher at Sophos wanted to tell you

11
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,750
a little bit about my background because

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,910
I think that's relevant to this talk and

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,840
the term fake news is a very loaded term

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,850
has a lot of political connotations and

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,860
especially in our current climate it can

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,640
be a very controversial but I am a

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,530
former journalist who then switched

18
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,420
gears and came into the security

19
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,610
industry after nearly 20 years of

20
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,750
working as a reporter and photographer

21
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,140
for some small newspapers and then large

22
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,940
print publications I worked for these

23
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,969
ones these school papers when I was in

24
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:56,430
college I also worked for photos travel

25
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,280
publishing and I spent almost a decade

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,859
at PC world which is a consumer tech

27
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,290
publication that unfortunately in about

28
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,290
2009 ceased publication so it doesn't

29
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,619
exist anymore but it still exists online

30
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:12,689
after I left PC world I switched gears

31
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,020
and jumped into the malware analysis

32
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,030
field I always loved playing with

33
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,159
computers and I did it as a hobby and

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,650
what drove me into security was that I

35
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,170
did a story for PC world the last year

36
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,400
that I worked there that was called

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,560
spyware follow that following the money

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,549
trail and it was a story involving using

39
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,729
packet capture tools and installing the

40
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:38,130
browser toolbars that were doing pop-up

41
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,020
ads on to computers and then observing

42
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,470
the redirection that that led from

43
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,700
affiliate to affiliate to affiliate to

44
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,920
eventually advertisers and as a result

45
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,920
of that story running some pretty major

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,220
advertisers like Best Buy and Dell cut

47
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,890
their ties with a lot of advertising

48
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,700
affiliate networks and it kind of

49
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,770
changed the advertising industry and it

50
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,860
really a it was a good feeling to feel

51
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,899
like I had made an impact on a problem

52
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,219
that had been plaguing people for a

53
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,429
number of years but also that it it told

54
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,949
me that I actually feel like I can do

55
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:11,430
this

56
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,830
and so so I jumped over and

57
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,450
was hired at a company called Webroot in

58
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,250
2006 and worked there as a malware

59
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,740
researcher for a number of years and

60
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,300
then after a while had met a fella by

61
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,490
the name of Joe levy who had been the

62
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,920
CTO of SonicWALL and he was starting a

63
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,320
small startup that was a network

64
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,470
forensics tool company and that company

65
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,140
called Solera networks and they were

66
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,300
soon after I joined the company

67
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,190
purchased by blue code and then that

68
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,960
blue coat was purchased by Symantec so I

69
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,730
invit end up essentially working for all

70
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,140
three of those companies over a period

71
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,300
of time I left Symantec earlier this

72
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,490
year in joint sofas and now I now I do

73
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,470
all of those things I run a malware

74
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,450
research lab I do Network forensics and

75
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,020
I worked on some of these CTA related

76
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,480
research like VPN filter and the Sam Sam

77
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,720
report that we published and and work on

78
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,180
that for Sophos labs as well as

79
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,220
publishing their blog called Sophus labs

80
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,400
on cut so a little bit of the background

81
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,350
because it's a security industry

82
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,390
audience and so I'm pretty sure that you

83
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,150
there aren't very many people here who

84
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,860
are journalism colleagues of mine but

85
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,090
basically there are things there's

86
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,380
certain things that all journalism

87
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,780
outlet needs they need their reporters

88
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,459
and editors obviously but they also need

89
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,110
their business side and their production

90
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,170
side so there's the ad sales people and

91
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,500
in journalism there is this essentially

92
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,150
what they call it is they literally call

93
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,250
it the firewall between editorial and

94
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,430
business and so usually the ad sales and

95
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,459
publisher side of things do not interact

96
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,230
with the editorial side of things at

97
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,239
least that is the optimal situation

98
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,160
production staff are just basically the

99
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,959
people who make sure that the words get

100
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,959
on to paper or in pixels and then of

101
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,239
course we need readers we need people

102
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,640
who will read the stories and we need to

103
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,410
provide them with the content that

104
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,790
they're going to you know that's going

105
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,200
to bring them back to a journalism

106
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,530
outlet over and over again the rule that

107
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,860
most journalism school professors will

108
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,320
will teach people as basically j-school

109
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,480
101 is that all news is local meaning

110
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,358
that whenever there is a story and you

111
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,000
are covering that story if you work for

112
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,669
the podunk Daily Press there has to be a

113
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:27,040
podunk wherever ville

114
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,930
angle to the story at least in the

115
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,640
headline if not just throughout the

116
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,940
story and so that is key and that is one

117
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,980
of the characteristics that I am

118
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,380
discovering is sort of notable about the

119
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,300
sites that I'm about to talk about so

120
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,820
just as an example of a real new site I

121
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,800
wanted to point out this one so it's

122
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,570
local from Colorado which is where I

123
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,350
live

124
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,210
it's Colorado Springs Gazette Colorado

125
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,280
Springs a city of about three four

126
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,350
hundred thousand people includes the US

127
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,310
Air Force Academy and the Colorado State

128
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,190
University as well as Cheyenne Mountain

129
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,160
complex and the the giant Peterson Air

130
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,880
Force Base

131
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,220
covers that region as you can see from

132
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,830
here that all of the headlines on this

133
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,520
front page of The Gazette from the last

134
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,580
24 hours are about how these things that

135
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,900
are of national importance have some

136
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,430
kind of local connection right and this

137
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,020
is what I mean when I say all news is

138
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,120
local even the story about Russian

139
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,310
hackers has a Colorado Springs angle

140
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,170
which is why it ended up above the fold

141
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,720
on the front page another characteristic

142
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,940
of real news sites and real newspapers

143
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,650
is something called the masthead the

144
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,900
masthead is the essentially the

145
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,090
organizational structure of the

146
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,940
publication and it is usually published

147
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,830
on the second or third page of the

148
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,630
newspaper and it there is always a page

149
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,120
on the website that has the names and

150
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,560
contact information for all the

151
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,540
reporters as well as the editorial staff

152
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,170
that the opinion piece authors as well

153
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,030
as advertisers and and other business

154
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,590
related emails but it's basically the

155
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,480
contact information for everybody at the

156
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,730
organization and and the masthead in

157
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,820
print is actually regulated by law by a

158
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,940
it not by law but by a an industry

159
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,000
organization that requires publications

160
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,980
to have a masthead and have certain

161
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,660
information about their publication

162
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,770
printed in every edition so one of the

163
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,110
cool things about this The Gazette is

164
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,540
that they they're they're a medium sized

165
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,400
journalism outfit and they've recently

166
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,460
bought a bunch of smaller town

167
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,750
newspapers that are in the sort of local

168
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,490
region and one of those is this one

169
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,250
called the the tri-lakes Tribune so

170
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:33,880
tri-lakes

171
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,580
is a region of up in the mountains a

172
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,090
sort of west of Colorado Springs that

173
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,290
includes a lot of small

174
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,110
and they bought these papers recently

175
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,580
and sort of added them into their

176
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,680
portfolio of news organizations so they

177
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,120
they have a website called tri-lakes

178
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,770
Tribune com

179
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,440
and this this newspaper has existed for

180
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,660
a long time it's only just recently sort

181
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,610
of been bought and it's part of the

182
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,220
ongoing conglomeration of news

183
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,830
organizations in the industry where

184
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,060
they're getting a smaller outlets are

185
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,530
being bought by bigger ones to sort of

186
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,300
increase their coverage and presence and

187
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,010
the smaller outlets are essentially

188
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,870
allowing themselves to be bought because

189
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,700
otherwise it's they're going out of

190
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,320
business it's very hard for them to stay

191
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,450
in business so and so this is just a

192
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:21,010
story from molasses tree launched the

193
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,100
website tri-lakes tribune calm and just

194
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,600
like all these other papers they have

195
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,870
local coverage in terms of the this town

196
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,460
called monument which is really kind of

197
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,260
a small town up in the in the mountains

198
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,990
near of ski resorts and then of course

199
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,460
there's a masthead with the names of the

200
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,660
reporters and you can see that there's

201
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,850
some some of the reporters have their

202
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,070
email addresses Gazette comm and some of

203
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,660
them is pikes Peaks newspapers comm

204
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,430
which is the they're both the parent

205
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,800
organizations but they're still in the

206
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,610
process of merging these two groups so

207
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,170
so the original ownership of tri-lakes

208
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,110
Tribune was from this company called the

209
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,500
called Colorado Community Media and this

210
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,300
is the who is information for the

211
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,160
website for this newspaper from last

212
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,570
year and they had registered a bunch of

213
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,450
domains including with and without the

214
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,950
hyphenation and.com

215
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,920
org net and so this is one that was

216
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,560
registered and was still active until

217
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,170
sometime last year and owned by this

218
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,370
Colorado newspaper group and when the

219
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,160
Colorado newspaper groups sold it or

220
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,230
when Colorado Community Media sold it to

221
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,770
the Gazette that was when they they kind

222
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,080
of let the registration on this domain

223
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,540
lapse and what happened was that you can

224
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,099
see here at the beginning of this year

225
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:35,289
over about a three-week period first the

226
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:38,260
domain just lapsed into availability for

227
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,330
someone to register and then at the end

228
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,650
of January this character who again we

229
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,270
can't trust whether the Whois

230
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,950
information is correct but this person

231
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,900
who says their name is Nick Deema in

232
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,690
odessa ukraine had registered the

233
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,340
tri-lakes tribune

234
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,430
web web domain and and yeah you're

235
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,820
wondering like why would someone in

236
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,710
Ukraine register a domain that had been

237
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,080
used for a newspaper in the United

238
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,510
States in the in a small one-horse

239
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,240
mountain town and the reality is is that

240
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,390
they wanted to start their own newspaper

241
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,420
they accept that they posed the the

242
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,160
positive that the existence of this

243
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,590
newspaper is that it is an organization

244
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:24,010
based in a town called van West Virginia

245
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,800
and as you can see they produce it's

246
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,540
actually still live like this this

247
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,880
website it does you know exists today

248
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,280
this is a screenshot from yesterday and

249
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,540
you can see that there's you know

250
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,880
coverage of the first lady on her trip

251
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,070
and there's this interesting story that

252
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,720
I that I found that the headline is

253
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,600
Trump says Saudi King wouldn't last two

254
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,670
weeks without United States support and

255
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,110
I called the tension that because I'm

256
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,940
gonna mention that particular headline

257
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,250
in a minute it's interesting but what

258
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,290
you do notice when you see this is that

259
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,660
there is no relevance in any of these

260
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,390
headlines to the town of van West

261
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,640
Virginia a town that I'd never heard of

262
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,230
before

263
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,370
another thing that's notable is the fact

264
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,620
that the the address information that's

265
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,410
on this contact page on the website and

266
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,710
says an address and it says van WV and

267
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,660
then underneath it it says West Virginia

268
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,050
again comma and the zip code and then of

269
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,370
course it gives a telephone number and

270
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,950
just one email address for editor at and

271
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,770
the small paper now it's not unusual for

272
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,690
very small newspapers to just have a

273
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,400
single email address but it is unusual

274
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,200
for a newspaper that was based in

275
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,360
Colorado and is now purported to come

276
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,700
from West Virginia to have an area code

277
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,450
and telephone number from Utah this is

278
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,030
the town of van West Virginia it has

279
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,000
about nine streets and a population of

280
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,970
around two hundred people one of the

281
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,290
facts that's really interesting about it

282
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,690
is that's not even a town it's called a

283
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,660
census-designated place so it is not

284
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,670
even an incorporated town with a city

285
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,230
council or police department it

286
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,200
literally is a post office a school and

287
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,240
a bunch of houses in the middle of the

288
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,380
mountains in West Virginia

289
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,940
what are some of these inconsistencies

290
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,070
well I've mentioned it there is no

291
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,930
tri-lakes region in West Virginia it

292
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,970
just doesn't exist why would there be a

293
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,470
magazine called the third newspaper

294
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,270
called the tri-lakes Tribune in a place

295
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,150
where there is no tri-lakes the street

296
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,010
that-that-that's said on its address

297
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,350
doesn't exist in this town that has

298
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,570
seven streets in it the area code is

299
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,390
wrong and the phone number doesn't work

300
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,380
okay I guess I'm not buying any

301
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,660
advertising oh I guess that maybe

302
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,450
explains why there is no advertising

303
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,240
whatsoever not one banner ad on any page

304
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,000
of that newspaper

305
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,970
so thanks to some of my friends at

306
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,490
Symantec who are willing to share some

307
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,100
information with me they were able to

308
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,570
look into some of their reputation

309
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,940
history for this particular domain and

310
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,950
this is a tool that they use that's

311
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,350
called billiard room I used to use this

312
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,660
tool when I was working there and what

313
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,450
it does is it kind of it correlates IP

314
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,089
addresses domain names the Whois address

315
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:06,600
of the registrant and other information

316
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,160
what's interesting is when we look at

317
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,600
this tri-lakes tribune you can see it's

318
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,070
been hosted at a few different IP

319
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,610
addresses this is over a long span of

320
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,800
time so some of these IP addresses where

321
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,740
this website was hosted correspond to

322
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,600
several years ago when it was part of

323
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,390
Colorado community news and some of it

324
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,760
or the address that's at the very bottom

325
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,490
there is the IP address where it is

326
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,320
hosted today which is this eighty eight

327
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,820
eighty five eighty nine twenty four

328
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,940
address looking at the other domains

329
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,820
that are hosted on that IP address you

330
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,470
can see that there are a few other news

331
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,900
like websites that are if you just look

332
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,339
at the domain names right there's this

333
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:47,050
Newburgh Gazette which I've called

334
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,390
attention to but there's also the

335
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,940
santaís news there's the Strand Gazette

336
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,580
info there's the village news online

337
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,459
Western reboot there's a bunch of other

338
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:00,100
domains that are sort of part of this

339
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,980
that had at one point been hosted on

340
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,990
this IP address that all have kind of a

341
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,750
newsie name to their domain and the one

342
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,370
that I wanted to sort of talk about next

343
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,720
is this Newburgh is that which is I

344
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,820
would have called out here so this is

345
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,500
the front page of the new Berg asset and

346
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,110
its masthead says that it's served

347
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,819
Newburgh Illinois since nineteen

348
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:20,979
so very similar to what we saw with the

349
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:24,399
with Colorado Springs Gazette except the

350
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,739
Colorado Springs Gazette actually exists

351
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,319
and this is as you can see it's actually

352
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:31,299
a screenshot from from yesterday from

353
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:33,850
the front page of this newspaper and the

354
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,379
newspaper has stories about Brett

355
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,839
Kavanaugh it has stories about Canadian

356
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,649
dairy farmers it has a snort story about

357
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:43,389
Tottenham Hotspur versus Barcelona so

358
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,999
European football very popular in small

359
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:48,220
town Illinois obviously and if you'll

360
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,709
notice in the most popular list there on

361
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:52,839
the right the third one down it says

362
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:55,509
Trump says Saudi King wouldn't last two

363
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:57,669
weeks without USA support that's an

364
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:00,129
interesting coincidence that they have

365
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:03,309
exactly the same headline some other

366
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,720
interesting things about the Newburgh

367
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,819
Gazette is that you know I have done

368
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:08,769
this research over the course of 18

369
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:11,049
months and so some of these screenshots

370
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:13,269
are fairly old including these - which

371
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,789
is where I just did some searching for

372
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,529
the Newburgh Gazette and references to

373
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:19,139
it in social media and as you can see

374
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,819
that there was a there was at one point

375
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,609
quite a lot of Facebook activity where

376
00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:26,589
people were linking to stories on the

377
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:28,539
Newburgh is that including this website

378
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:31,619
that's was called breaking a world in

379
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:35,949
news today is what it was called and in

380
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:37,569
addition to these websites there was

381
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:40,179
also lots of stuff on Twitter that was

382
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,600
posted and linking back to these guys

383
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,919
they have a contact information page and

384
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:48,249
sort of just like the tri-lakes Tribune

385
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:51,309
this Newburgh Gazette is you know has

386
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:53,259
its address on there

387
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,869
and if you look it up you can see that

388
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:58,179
it's in a town of called Buffalo Grove

389
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:01,569
now as it turns out a few years ago when

390
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:03,429
I was a reporter for PC world they sent

391
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:05,470
me on assignment out to meet some people

392
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,829
to do a privacy check up story and one

393
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:10,539
of the people that I met with was in the

394
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:12,039
town of Buffalo Grove and it was just a

395
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:14,139
coincidence to see that this small

396
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:16,569
suburb of Chicago was referenced on this

397
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:18,669
news site so I thought that was kind of

398
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:21,129
interesting what was more interesting

399
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,169
though was the fact that there is no

400
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:25,419
town called Newburgh Illinois then the

401
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:28,149
nearest the closest name of a town is

402
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:30,939
something called Newburgh Township and

403
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:32,590
Newburgh Township much like

404
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,530
and West Virginia is a very small town

405
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,960
it's basically a population under a

406
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,600
hundred sorry under a thousand and has

407
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,600
about 500 house units or says a it

408
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,930
contained 428 housing units in 2010

409
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,290
maybe by now they've built a few more

410
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,480
this is a Google map that shows you the

411
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,220
distance and the route that you might

412
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,380
take if you were going to drive from

413
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,320
Newburgh Township Illinois to Buffalo

414
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,780
Grove so if that you were covering if

415
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,730
you were a local news reporter for a

416
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,130
tiny little newspaper in this tiny town

417
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,520
of a thousand people a 300 mile drive to

418
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,810
work every day just doesn't seem like a

419
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,190
really great way to get the kind of

420
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,690
coverage that you think you would need

421
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,420
for such a small community and it is

422
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,480
distinctive because once again we have a

423
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,970
situation where there is no Newburgh

424
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,250
Illinois that there is no Street in

425
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,650
Buffalo Grove that is the street address

426
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,750
where the newspaper claims to come from

427
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,310
the phone numbers disconnected and

428
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,310
there's this 300 mile gap between the

429
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,700
two towns something is smelling very

430
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,100
wrong here

431
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,720
so looking at billiard-room again and

432
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,800
talking and you know talking about this

433
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,140
Newburgh Gazette so now this is a this

434
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,980
is was never a real website it was never

435
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,190
a legitimate news outlet and it has been

436
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,350
hosted at two different IPS now it shows

437
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,810
on the left here that it was hosted on

438
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,080
that 88 85 IP and for a period of time

439
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,190
it also shared an IP one 49 56 190 10

440
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,790
which happens to be hosted right here in

441
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,490
Montreal by OVH a big internet service

442
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,339
provider the little ball that sort of

443
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,859
often the in the to the right there that

444
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:21,819
says 362 is an indication from the from

445
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,730
the semantic reputation service that at

446
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,099
at some time at some point in the past

447
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:30,100
and over the the history of their

448
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,250
reputation service that 362 unique

449
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,400
domains had been DNS to that IP and when

450
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,160
we look at that it's very interesting

451
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,780
well let's talk a little bit about this

452
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,460
Newburgh stuff first before we jump into

453
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,950
that IP so that it has private who is so

454
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,290
unlike Nick

455
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,680
from Odessa Ukraine we don't know who

456
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,260
really owns this domain as I mentioned

457
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,060
it was hosted on these two IP addresses

458
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,160
at one time or another and when we look

459
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,300
at what else was hosted on 149 dot 56

460
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,970
this is just a slice of a gigantic list

461
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,510
of almost 400 domains and if you just

462
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,070
look at the list you'll see that there's

463
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,520
a lot of new sites on this domain or on

464
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,380
hosted on this IP so there's you know

465
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,470
spaceflight insider info and lung

466
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,990
disease news web and tax justice blog

467
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,000
and us a daily stocks but as well

468
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,950
there's like Stock News Gazette strand

469
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,030
Gazette info American Daily News 24 and

470
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:33,330
so on and so forth yeah so going down

471
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:38,280
the rabbit hole this has been for me a

472
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,860
kind of a mission so I started doing

473
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,210
this while I was still working at

474
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:46,170
Symantec and the further I looked and

475
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,820
the more of these domains that I

476
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,550
individually looked at they kept leading

477
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,010
me further and further down this rabbit

478
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,650
hole and leading to more and more of

479
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,110
these websites that are just like the

480
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,140
Newburgh the Newburgh zet and the Tri

481
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,410
Valley newspaper and there are just

482
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,630
hundreds of them on this one IP address

483
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,740
but when you look at each one

484
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,930
individually and you start to correlate

485
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,730
well this this one was hosted on this

486
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,800
other IP and what else is hosted on this

487
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,350
IP and there's another 400 here and you

488
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,090
start looking at all the 400 that are on

489
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,220
that one and many of them are hosted on

490
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,170
two or three IP addresses elsewhere and

491
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,110
those also contain many more news sites

492
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,550
that no one's ever heard of and that

493
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,070
contained fictitious contact information

494
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,680
and basically forged information and

495
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,890
it's really not even all in the United

496
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,950
States they they're sharing the same CMS

497
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,080
templates they're sharing the same sort

498
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,650
of goofy address glitches in the way

499
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,720
that they present their contact

500
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,230
information and and most of them in fact

501
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,820
a pretty I am gonna stay right here

502
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,330
right now all of them never existed and

503
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,270
do not actually exist in the places that

504
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,300
they purport to cover

505
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,860
so some of these characteristics of

506
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,750
these domain names that are that they

507
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,080
share across these across these

508
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,790
thousands and thousands of domains that

509
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,250
have eventually led to is that they

510
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,170
neither have a name of a place which I

511
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,880
think you saw that there's there's place

512
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,200
names but there's no there's also like

513
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,440
an industry or a topic that is there you

514
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,230
know purported focus of coverage like

515
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,230
financial or health or tech and then

516
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,210
there's a lot of other names that get

517
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,000
thrown in there like 24 or Tribune or

518
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,010
pres and so you might get the you know

519
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,190
the health observer Tribune 24 comm or

520
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,240
the tech weekly reporter dotnet and they

521
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,450
pick permutation of these hundreds of

522
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,880
different real words to create

523
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,030
fictitious domain names and and

524
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,880
repeatedly produce these websites and so

525
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,309
this slide here I just wanted to mention

526
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:57,300
so before gdpr came into effect some of

527
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,280
these domains were not registered with

528
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,080
private Whois and they had like the dick

529
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,950
Nick Dima guy if that's his real name

530
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:09,540
used a distinctive non unique email

531
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,910
address for his who has information and

532
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,400
I was able to use a an account at domain

533
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,290
tools to set up an alert so that every

534
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,540
time the user with that email address

535
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,600
registered a new domain it would send me

536
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,800
these alerts and this is just a

537
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,440
screenshot of the messages that I get

538
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,170
like literally on a daily basis this

539
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,540
same Schmo is registering two to five

540
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,630
domains and getting a website up and

541
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,309
running with different names different

542
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:38,400
cities and fictitious information it's

543
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,870
it started you start to realize when

544
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,640
he's working at these levels of volume

545
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,679
that he doesn't have the time to

546
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,300
actually validate whether van West

547
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,790
Virginia has a you know street name Tory

548
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,270
Lane he just doesn't care and there's

549
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,040
also lots of foreign editions so there's

550
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,960
lots of these sites that are in Italian

551
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,780
in French they're ones that purport to

552
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,760
be from various countries in Africa

553
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,830
there's the when they're when they're

554
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,050
from northern Africa they're often in

555
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,510
French which pep you know sort of

556
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,600
parallels French the French history

557
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,280
French colonial history in that part of

558
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,480
the world

559
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,490
and there and there's just tons and tons

560
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,390
and tons of these sites all right this

561
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,500
is the interesting thing

562
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,480
most of the copy most of the news

563
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,190
stories have been scraped from real

564
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,580
places so you read these stories and you

565
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,080
see what's being promoted on social

566
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,820
media and you're like well you know okay

567
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,700
so they're not just you know dumping a

568
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,830
load of BS on us this is you know this

569
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,660
is a real story about Brett Kavanaugh or

570
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,370
there's a real story about oil price

571
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,200
changes this is a real story about some

572
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,660
sports team it may not be relevant to

573
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,490
the local you know community but it's

574
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:48,090
there's nothing fake about the news well

575
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,010
I mean it is kind of curious that they

576
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,570
violate that prime directive that none

577
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,970
of them have that local angle to it you

578
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,940
it's clear to me that there is there's

579
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,100
automation at work here that's scraping

580
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,780
a whole bunch of different news sites

581
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,000
and just dumping this content into some

582
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,490
kind of bucket which then populates out

583
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,560
into these things but every once in a

584
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,750
while there's a story that put you know

585
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,030
picks a particular political focus or a

586
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,450
particular angle on current events and

587
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,090
they have they they do go out there and

588
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,310
promote themselves on social media they

589
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,830
have networks of people who's you know

590
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,980
seem to follow the catania daily top and

591
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,350
and post a lot of stories about whatever

592
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,260
this town is in is it there's a town

593
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,840
called Catania Tennessee and again it's

594
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,940
one of these like tiny little you know

595
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,820
but in Europe you call it a village but

596
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,430
they're not even that size and and these

597
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,860
new sites are just continuing to

598
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,720
flourish and and they're the people who

599
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,250
are registering these sites and

600
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,080
continuing to produce them and make them

601
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,660
live make more and more of them every

602
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,000
day what the hell are they doing there

603
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,830
not a lot of them are not selling ads

604
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,370
although some are they've been changing

605
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,070
hands periodically so sometimes they're

606
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,350
created by this Nick Nemeth guy or some

607
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,880
of the other registered users who

608
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,100
created some of these ones in originally

609
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,040
and then they sell them on to search

610
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,020
engine optimization companies and

611
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,200
spammers who then continue to operate

612
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,910
the site like it's a real site but then

613
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,950
when they've sold them on the people who

614
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,620
buy them from these people throw

615
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,120
advertising on them

616
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,159
and turn them into a an ad revenue

617
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,260
generator for themselves which they then

618
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,360
span out the links on social media so

619
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,010
people click the links go to the site

620
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:36,240
the ad pops and they get paid but most

621
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,429
of them do not have any advertising at

622
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:41,580
all and this is Anathem in journalism

623
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,880
it's impossible I mean you've seen a two

624
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,210
stalks ago where we saw the slide where

625
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,429
slate was using crypto mining as an

626
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:52,140
alternative like if you're using an ad

627
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,760
blocker well you don't even need to use

628
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,010
an ad blocker I had you block origin

629
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,690
running in my browser and a lot of times

630
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,669
you blowed these pages and it would say

631
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:01,830
zero out of a hundred were blocked

632
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,860
because there's no ads on the page and

633
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,140
it's just bizarre who is paying for the

634
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,789
registrations who's paying for the

635
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:10,380
hosting and who is paying for the

636
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,210
development of these sites I have no

637
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,020
idea I wish I did as I mentioned some of

638
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,789
the speculative reasons is that their

639
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:19,799
search engine optimization tools that

640
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,750
they may be being used to promote

641
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,600
certain things through search engines so

642
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,659
that they get ad revenue clicks not all

643
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:28,919
the sites are ad for hate but there's

644
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,289
also the idea that social media

645
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:33,510
manipulation is at play and in some

646
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,190
cases and especially with the Newburgh

647
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,840
Gazette I have seen social media being

648
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,510
used to promote a particular ideology or

649
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,020
a particular spin on the news and it is

650
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,919
impossible to avoid and then there's the

651
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,220
sort of third angle here which is that

652
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,470
there's been this philosophy that seems

653
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,179
to be proliferating through the world

654
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,490
these days that people are calling the

655
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,260
firehose of which is

656
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,779
essentially that if you flood the world

657
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,820
with so much information and that's

658
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,700
misinformation and confusing that people

659
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,100
start to disbelieve in their sources of

660
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,899
information it actually threatens the

661
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:17,070
very fabric of truth and society by

662
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,230
providing people and out where they can

663
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:22,740
just say well it's just the mainstream

664
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,289
media lamestream media why do I care

665
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:26,789
about them they lie about everything

666
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:29,210
anyway and that is actually an

667
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,649
information warfare technique that was

668
00:26:31,649 --> 00:26:34,260
pioneered in the 1960s and that if you

669
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,270
talk to Intelligence Agency folks where

670
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,770
they will tell you that

671
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,870
has been something that certain

672
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,730
governments have done for a very long

673
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,310
time and it is not unusual and they they

674
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,530
see that and recognize that in its sort

675
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,690
of modern digital form but it's been

676
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,250
going on for years it's just that with

677
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,050
the internet and social media they

678
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,660
suddenly have massive reach to spread to

679
00:26:54,660 --> 00:27:00,150
lots of places so this is the important

680
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,090
part what can we do because we're not

681
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:03,930
reporters

682
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,540
we're not editors we're not publishers

683
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,910
of newspapers well with the exception of

684
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,520
you know the the and and some security

685
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,650
companies let us say you know and I am

686
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,800
grateful to for the existence of places

687
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,150
like threat posts that are run by

688
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,250
Kaspersky and naked security which is

689
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,610
run by my company and several other

690
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,650
security industry companies realized

691
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:28,350
several years ago that if the industry

692
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,810
doesn't fund its own journalism even if

693
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,820
it isn't necessarily favorable to the

694
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,700
company that is sponsoring it that it

695
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,580
may just go away that hasn't panned out

696
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,200
completely there's still great outlets

697
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,530
like wired and Ars Technica

698
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,810
but clearly tech journalism has taken a

699
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,030
hit like the rest of the industry in the

700
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,520
last several years and they need our

701
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,210
help so these are some of my suggestions

702
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,360
of how we can work together to help if

703
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,870
you read tech journalism and I'm sure

704
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,760
most of you do and are sitting here you

705
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,870
know scrolling through your Twitter feed

706
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,660
and reading the latest about the

707
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,730
coverage of the supply chain attacks

708
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,760
against super micro support those

709
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,210
outlets I actually I subscribed the the

710
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,860
ARS technica did a subscription drive

711
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,210
last year for the first time where they

712
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,500
asked people to subscribe and they were

713
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,000
gonna give out a Yubikey as a gift and I

714
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,040
always wanted to ubk and I support their

715
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,540
journalism so I just signed up and

716
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,980
became a member of Ars Technica it

717
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,390
doesn't mean I have to post on their

718
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,160
forums and become a like an active

719
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,200
member of their message board but my 30

720
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,820
bucks went to that journalism outlet it

721
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,290
means that they can keep doing what they

722
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,780
do which is great journalism and telling

723
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,660
the truth so if you can do that that's

724
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,050
great if you have the money drop it

725
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,580
there are tools that journalists use and

726
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,430
need to be able to cover the news a big

727
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,450
one is secured

728
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,799
so this is the tool that was created

729
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,589
originally by Aaron Swartz and some

730
00:28:55,589 --> 00:28:58,519
other folks and it's it's essentially a

731
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:02,009
it's it's a tool that anyone can use the

732
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:03,479
newspapers will put it on their website

733
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:07,049
and say if you've got a hot tip on news

734
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:09,809
and you want to safely and anonymously

735
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:13,559
give us information for this tip it is a

736
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,429
it is in theory a highly secure way for

737
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:19,019
sources to reach out to journalistic

738
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:21,269
outlets and send tips and actually some

739
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:23,909
of the most important scoops that have

740
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:25,709
been covered by The Washington Post in

741
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:27,779
the New York Times and The Guardian and

742
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:31,289
the BBC have all come out of secure drop

743
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:34,409
tips and the problem is that right now

744
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:37,200
well I mean we know poor Aaron is is

745
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,779
gone and it's not with us anymore but

746
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,179
the the tool itself is in need of an

747
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:43,979
update and desperately in need of

748
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:47,549
security people to help bring about the

749
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:49,769
next generation of this tool so if you

750
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:52,320
if you can donate money then great if

751
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,329
you can donate your time and your coding

752
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:57,149
expertise I am NOT a coder but if I

753
00:29:57,149 --> 00:29:59,219
could I would because I can see that

754
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:01,259
that secure drop is a useful tool for

755
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:04,289
journalists and and they really need our

756
00:30:04,289 --> 00:30:07,139
help because now what's starting to

757
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,029
happen and I've been speaking to some of

758
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:10,709
my friends who are editors at newspapers

759
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,749
is that they are starting to receive

760
00:30:12,749 --> 00:30:14,729
weaponized documents coming through

761
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,469
secure drop and they don't necessarily

762
00:30:16,469 --> 00:30:18,690
they may have a secure way to receive

763
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,849
those documents but they have no safe

764
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:23,429
way to detonate them in a sandbox and be

765
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:25,039
able to make sure that they're not a

766
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,629
malicious doc or a malicious spreadsheet

767
00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:29,729
or a malicious PDF or RTF or

768
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:30,570
what-have-you

769
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,289
so help them out because the journalists

770
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:35,999
are really hapless in this regard

771
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:38,369
they're not experts at security and if

772
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,739
they were to get a weaponized document

773
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:43,409
purporting to be some scoop on a giant

774
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:46,589
news story they are likely to click it

775
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:49,109
and I mean it's you know we've all seen

776
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:50,879
the reports that come out of places like

777
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:53,549
citizen lab where they we know that

778
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:55,579
there are governments and that there are

779
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:58,440
groups that are specifically targeting

780
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,899
civil society and as part of this

781
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:03,440
journalism is part of civil society

782
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,960
and we need to protect them we are the

783
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,610
only ones who can and the most most

784
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:15,110
important thing is that I've been I've

785
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,759
been looking for ways that I can give

786
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:18,679
back to this community because I was a

787
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:20,659
journalist and I can see the threat that

788
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:23,210
they're under and what I've been doing

789
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,039
is I've been volunteering my time to

790
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,870
teach reporters how to not get hacked

791
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,580
and in fact I'm teaching so at the

792
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,080
University of Colorado which is in the

793
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,850
town where I live I'm gonna be teaching

794
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,039
a bunch of classes just for free to

795
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,809
students to just drop in at the

796
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:38,240
makerspace called don't get hacked and

797
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,100
it's about how to avoid getting fished

798
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,929
and how to avoid getting you know

799
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:43,190
infected with malware and how most

800
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,200
malware comes down the pike to into your

801
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,690
machine it's just the basics because

802
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:50,269
most people don't have this this is not

803
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:51,860
part of the standard educational

804
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,679
curriculum almost anywhere and if

805
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,330
there's a way that you can volunteer

806
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,820
your time in your local area this is an

807
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,009
international audience go back to your

808
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:03,409
communities reach out to journalists to

809
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:07,070
schools to old folks homes wherever go

810
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,570
to your Public Library they offer

811
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,460
classes for free to people who want to

812
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,080
just sign up and take classes offer

813
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,210
don't get hacked class at the library

814
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:17,179
it's a great thing to do and the ripple

815
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:19,100
effects of that kind of volunteer work

816
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,750
are incredibly unbelievably important

817
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,759
we're living in an era where the very

818
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,090
nature of truth is is a threat we're all

819
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:32,000
at risk as a result of this but we have

820
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,820
the ability to do something so lift up

821
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,399
your hands and do something whatever it

822
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:40,129
is whatever you can contribute we need

823
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:40,909
to work together

824

and a half old story about what are the

833
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,720
