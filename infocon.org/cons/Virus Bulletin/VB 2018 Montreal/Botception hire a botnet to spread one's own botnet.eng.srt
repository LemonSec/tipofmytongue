1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,419
okay so the so the next talk is a yawn

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,040
and a dog we're gonna talk about

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,010
perception higher button it to spread

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,240
one's own violence

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,179
hello everybody before we all dive into

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,110
our presentation

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,610
let me introduce ourself real quick

8
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,770
collection - I'm Kilmer I'm working on

9
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,449
us for last nine years currently the

10
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,390
Morales arises teammate and is my

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,580
colleague are all said of mr. engineer

12
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,310
of a software interests are both night

13
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,480
and cryptography well today I would like

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,940
to share with you the info from our

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,100
research base on the neck course

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,280
monitoring and during our monitoring the

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,550
early of 2018 we found out there was a

18
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,800
change in the pattern of the regulation

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,590
sprite samples to the neck course but

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,289
not for the branch we are monitoring was

21
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,460
I should but interesting because there

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,180
is one day they start sharing the gwee

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,969
BS was slightly obfuscated to it

24
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:59,340
and really look into most right

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,040
interesting we found so at the beginning

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,320
the working how it's working good so how

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,150
at the beginning I'll give you just

28
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,670
really short brief in football tonight

29
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,250
for this story there another will share

30
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,110
with you how we monitor the neck curves

31
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,900
branch and we get information how we get

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,850
the information from this branch sir

33
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,979
there and of course the variety of the

34
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,080
chain of all infections the data we got

35
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,290
from this branch and then we will dive

36
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,170
deeply into the BBS control panel the

37
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,579
information we will describe the

38
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,000
functions of this BBS control panel and

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,860
because we found out more versions

40
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,360
your comparisons and then out of the go

41
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,119
to the stager and final payload we got

42
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,939
from this and of course at the end is

43
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,829
gonna be some summary of our talk was

44
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:55,049
like services and rights so the history

45
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,759
of my course provided all of you know

46
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,680
the necros botnet actually it's

47
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,329
definitely the largest parbat nut

48
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,210
worldwide and it appeared in late 2012

49
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,710
and the biggest company combines sprite

50
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,628
binoculars for example directs

51
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,340
Loki and globulin poster

52
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:19,829
well now I'll over tell you how we are

53
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:21,840
murdering the branch we got information

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,500
from it so before we get it a tracker

55
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,379
itself I'll start on the best whiff and

56
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,829
I curse protocols that's it so we are

57
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,150
interested in three protocols there

58
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,799
should be I think two more at least so

59
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:37,650
far so the most important protocol is c2

60
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,379
protocol this protocol is used in

61
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,120
communication with controller command

62
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,840
server it's used to distribute new new

63
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,239
peers pure lists which are used as

64
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,879
fallback then it is used to distribute

65
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,760
new IP addresses of these servers or

66
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,030
even new modules with their respective

67
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,760
parameters if this protocol fails

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,129
there's a peer-to-peer protocol if

69
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:04,859
that's used to recover idea the these

70
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:07,200
addresses or sometimes there's something

71
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,040
I shall call a shared secret a small I

72
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,349
think it's four bytes of information

73
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:17,129
taken from the public key which belongs

74
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:19,829
to the server and this value is used to

75
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:22,470
derive the communication key and of

76
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,060
course those branches are welcome soon

77
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,290
are identified by by URL path so if the

78
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,970
path changes it has to be updated over

79
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,609
the peer-to-peer protocol as I said

80
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:37,979
there's there's something called modules

81
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:40,949
so we go there mail module there should

82
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:45,269
be a finger to moon all modules but for

83
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,250
our purposes man what is most important

84
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,769
one it's used to distribute email

85
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:52,680
templates recipient lists and those

86
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,370
templates are let's say scripted so you

87
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,590
have to also recover receive some

88
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,359
variables which are also distributed

89
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,909
from this through this protocol so now

90
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:08,180
filter itself leaf reverse engineer

91
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,759
client and we try to emulate it and also

92
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,769
since the protocol distributes

93
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:16,320
listing peers we try to aggregate this

94
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,380
list and try to keep track of the of the

95
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,770
botnets activity each branch is

96
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,810
identified by a by the shared secret so

97
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,520
every breath every branch corresponds to

98
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,000
one let's say possible password this is

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,510
use then these branches have further sub

100
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,860
branches

101
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,870
these are identified by peer-to-peer

102
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,290
share it again in a similar way there's

103
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,750
another public key which is used to sign

104
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,740
messages that are sent for this protocol

105
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,830
so again the messages are encrypted and

106
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,560
the base for the for the key for this

107
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,590
encryption is again some bytes from from

108
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,720
this key currently we are tracking for

109
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,930
sub branches or all belonging to this to

110
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,250
the same branch as far as I know there

111
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,380
are at least five other branches however

112
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,139
we are not tracking them yet the

113
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,900
branches I mentioned of sub branches I

114
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,750
defied by Europe passed locator PHP News

115
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,360
index new soap new stream pretty much

116
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,440
generic addresses so how does it work

117
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,229
the core value there's an a curse itself

118
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:31,560
it contacts a CNC server Hague or

119
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,650
somehow got some interesting data and

120
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:39,330
provided there's a new module it's I got

121
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,979
back its hash so I can then similarly

122
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,890
recover the module from a fancy server

123
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,669
so suppose we unloaded mayor module so

124
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:52,740
we download it execute it with

125
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,070
parameters like given before and this

126
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,810
module is pretty much the same plate it

127
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,700
asks for template we receive a template

128
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,220
and it looks something like that

129
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,260
as you can see there are some variables

130
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,300
so for example message ID is pretty much

131
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,139
random and there's one other thing you

132
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,070
see the bottom you can see item quote

133
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,669
one dot doc which is taken from the from

134
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:23,370
the list it's an attachment so at the

135
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,139
beginning when he was template I

136
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,190
received a live list of items I have to

137
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,700
ask for so let's say there's 100 dog and

138
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,000
I have to

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,610
request this item separately then I

140
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,970
inserted into into the email then I

141
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,790
forward this email to SMTP server and

142
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,230
send it to intended recipients

143
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,960
so as gets to to the infection we would

144
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,880
like to describe so the beginning we got

145
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,910
a micros botnet or ask more specifically

146
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,180
I'll monitor branch from that we recover

147
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,900
template and resources resources so we

148
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,140
got internet shortcut and that was

149
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,140
passed officials and this shortcut

150
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,080
referred to be VBS control panel which

151
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,620
again try to contact is its own C&C

152
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,030
server which is computed as an

153
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,510
infrastructure which offered us a new

154
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,620
binary the script try to execute it and

155
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,200
after several stages it led to flow flow

156
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,700
flow TM a remote administration tool so

157
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,160
now I wanna tell you something about the

158
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,730
panel itself well when I will go through

159
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,860
the control panel itself maybe some of

160
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,419
you especially those where on the great

161
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,840
presentation this morning by Xhosa Rossi

162
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,290
hello similarities traits we found out

163
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,570
this control bottle Paulo is the same as

164
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,560
the RS be based on loop loader but

165
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,720
nobody is actuate we look slightly

166
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,510
differently on this same issue we'll

167
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,600
show you some information so at the

168
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,340
beginning as we mentioned the week team

169
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,100
receive then some spy message which

170
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,370
contains the attachment there is

171
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,340
interest shortcut in a 7-zip archive and

172
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,729
when we unpaid and receive this shortcut

173
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,410
there are two interesting parts of

174
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,729
course the first none that we can see

175
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:21,580
there is some random name that VBS so

176
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,260
now there is running to visual basic

177
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,140
script then the case that the user just

178
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,729
don't know rate and neutronic and

179
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:29,979
immediately they are trying to set up

180
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:34,750
some icon to follow users or victims to

181
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,030
run it later and the most interesting

182
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,330
part for us if you look in the URL they

183
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,030
are using instead of the HTTP or HTTPS

184
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,940
there is in the file Jesus SMB sharing

185
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,769
which allow the

186
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:48,999
if you use the roundest intern a

187
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:53,079
shortcut to directly open the VBS script

188
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:57,160
and run it from the SMB share that's the

189
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,230
big benefit for attackers but

190
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,540
fortunately for us it's also beneficial

191
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,160
for us because we can get all

192
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,069
pre-prepared samples on the SMB share so

193
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:11,499
when you look there we could not easily

194
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:13,869
download all we be as usual prepare for

195
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:17,429
the future campaigns get a payload and

196
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:20,579
analyze it great actions etc and

197
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:22,989
probably the biggest advantage of the

198
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:25,929
SMB sharing that the author of the

199
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:28,059
malware can leave you some lovely

200
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:31,420
messages like this come from you love it

201
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,049
right it's very nice that you can share

202
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:36,970
with them and share some common

203
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,049
interests together well when I go

204
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:43,119
directly to the BBS kripak slave its

205
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:45,670
communicated with the C&C server was an

206
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,529
interesting part is hard-coded C&C

207
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:51,579
server address and in all samples we go

208
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:53,350
we went through actually there was only

209
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,769
one C&C server address but the script

210
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:58,689
itself is prepared contained more others

211
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:02,199
which can be changed in a time it's

212
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:03,759
getting some information about the

213
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,740
infected device which can be used to

214
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,920
identify the user device or in future in

215
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,559
can be also used by the attacker to

216
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,839
avoid running the script for example in

217
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,259
new virtual machine etc as I mentioned

218
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:18,730
they are prepared for updated with

219
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,549
fallback CNC servers in the case that

220
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:23,259
the CNC server the privacy server

221
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:25,540
stopped responding they can easily

222
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,740
switch it but so far we didn't see more

223
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,279
than one so they already for the future

224
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,839
somebody to use it abated and the

225
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,679
communication is pretty is it's just

226
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:43,350
using the simple post request on the

227
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,389
domain with the CNC server is going to

228
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:48,879
post request or gate PHP with all

229
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:51,249
information and the comments

230
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:55,990
gotten from it used well I look into the

231
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,999
functions of this VBS control panel

232
00:10:57,999 --> 00:10:59,230
there's several

233
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,660
functionalities one of them is don't

234
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,250
execute there are two options actually

235
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,870
can download execute executable file or

236
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,930
plug-in sure it's pretty easy it's just

237
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,510
good from the C&C server the URL should

238
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,760
be committed and what kind of file

239
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,300
should be downloaded and the same is for

240
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,910
the plug-in in fact the only difference

241
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,650
they just don't own in the DLL file and

242
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:28,900
then register it and run it and you can

243
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,950
notice here is the string the RS we just

244
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,110
mentioned by I hosted morning as they

245
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,640
named it RS we best loader but the fact

246
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,860
is just already working as a control

247
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,240
panel or so several more functions

248
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,650
actually it's the upgrade control panel

249
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,710
and delete control panel so you can just

250
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,510
easily be received come on update or

251
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,180
delete they just go to the location

252
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,010
where is the original VBS located and

253
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,480
set up the string which we receive in

254
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,310
case of uninstall it set up just the

255
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,850
white space into the office and then

256
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,120
kill the script running so they can

257
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,460
easily just get rid of like the evidence

258
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,870
from being fifty divided etcetera and

259
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,800
our function like sure it's pretty

260
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,990
interesting they can is around the DDoS

261
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,620
attack

262
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,160
so in the case the D DOS command got

263
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,560
number of control panel we just use

264
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,570
again the simple post with the

265
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,360
hard-coded string so they receive the

266
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,100
two arguments actually first one is the

267
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,380
target that URL and the second one is

268
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,060
the number of that it should be done by

269
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:42,220
the control panel and of course each

270
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,440
stuff even this one needs some

271
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,840
persistence the person errors in three

272
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,180
different functionalities which is the

273
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,560
freshman there are in scheduled tasks

274
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,460
they set up the chrome update as a

275
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,630
describe itself stuff is a group update

276
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,480
and it's run in the setup time now the

277
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,940
way they write the register key into the

278
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,260
run and to be sure that nobody kill or

279
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,360
stop the process they are using using

280
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,950
the budget doc something we call Cody

281
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,080
doc we're just checking if the scrip is

282
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,720
to running high in case it stopped we

283
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,200
just lock leave

284
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,680
the trigger in the snow defense and

285
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,370
rerun the script again and as I

286
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,240
mentioned to login

287
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,420
of course the login is a key actually

288
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,550
sure I have to admit that when we went

289
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,610
to the VBS group itself we're never seen

290
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,910
better commented and log script written

291
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,889
by our author sir in fact I think they

292
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:39,490
are writing better than us because like

293
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,350
everything was commented each function

294
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,199
was some lock part and select in point

295
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,420
to the VA dot txt as I mentioned at the

296
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,269
beginning shall we receive more versions

297
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:55,220
there are some differences in the

298
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,060
opposition

299
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,040
the first was pretty easy the only

300
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,199
interesting part the script reads itself

301
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:03,350
and from the commands its dick called

302
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:08,269
the final payload and in diversion chili

303
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:10,190
try to obfuscate this slightly harder

304
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,769
that to avoid the regular string

305
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:17,149
detection etc most interesting part is

306
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,420
when we look into the office critic part

307
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,519
as you can see in the bottom part

308
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:25,040
actually it show us the red line show us

309
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,529
the similarities in the code as you can

310
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:31,579
see they are just shifted like I saw it

311
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,279
shows that the big parts of the code are

312
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:37,760
the same and they just add and remove

313
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,640
some functionalities in the version too

314
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,440
so you can see on the left there is the

315
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,540
version one eye on the right there is a

316
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,149
version two in this case they just add

317
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:48,860
the possibility to use you in the

318
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,089
PowerShell in the code well now that I

319
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:56,660
put words to add off so before we we get

320
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,839
to payload which was fetched by this

321
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,620
control panel

322
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,779
what's our capital a bit loose a bit we

323
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:05,959
got a botnet necro let's say this

324
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:07,670
control panel which is more was like a

325
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:12,139
boat that's press inside inside another

326
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:16,639
boat plant so does it end here or not so

327
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,250
let's have a look at the payload the

328
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,529
payload is rather simple stager

329
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,410
it's an employment emulation tricks for

330
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,010
example repeated external function calls

331
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,400
with no observable side effects then

332
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,350
checks for several windows system

333
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,510
processes so for example explore x-ray

334
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:41,500
and it does some cleanup which try among

335
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,780
other things it tries to replace or old

336
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,690
image related services and establish new

337
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,380
ones it also checks for several AV

338
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,760
products with a possibility of

339
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,340
termination if if they are detected and

340
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,100
then it proceeds to the unloading

341
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,290
payload as you can see the screen it's

342
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:05,020
the address again hard-coded and the

343
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,210
payload is encrypted it's encrypted by

344
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:11,830
our rc4 cipher the key again it's pretty

345
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:16,120
much obvious that it's hard-coded the

346
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,780
payload surprisingly contained flawed

347
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,790
email which is quite a common remote on

348
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,460
assertion tool which is bait based on a

349
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,840
source code that leaked several years

350
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,960
ago from a software which is called ma

351
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,770
admin so far we suspect it is the last

352
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,720
stage we haven't been able to observe

353
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,510
for the communication or further

354
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,270
attempts to download more stages even

355
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,460
though it's within capabilities of this

356
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,090
rat it can establish a remote desktop it

357
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,600
can move files back and forth you can

358
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,160
use it to establish a proxy proxy

359
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,620
through the client or even start an

360
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,250
audio chat so to conclude our

361
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:02,080
presentation we you know we are able to

362
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,599
track some how email spread by directly

363
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:08,619
by the botnet by querying directly and

364
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:11,380
we are able to you know to get her hands

365
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,380
on quite interesting file it was spread

366
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,270
through interests shortcut in an email

367
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,079
attachment it was distributed through

368
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,020
SMB share and it was a quite simply be a

369
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,250
script the script download it's a stager

370
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,160
which in turn downloaded a rat called

371
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,520
for Jaime so I think that's it for this

372
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,260
whole for us and probably not the best

373
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,110
time for questions thank you alright

374
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,580
thank you your honor Dolph
