1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,830
please join me in welcoming one from

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,210
Chronicle who's going to talk to us

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,760
right it's going to talk to us a little

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,530
bit about some of the challenges with

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,929
attribution and cyber so cyber threat

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,800
actors cool hello everybody thank you

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,600
for showing up this is I think I always

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,730
get the tricky slots so in the morning

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,470
after the gala dinner or right after

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,080
lunch when everybody's nodding off and

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,050
this is not particularly easy because I

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,760
think I have one of I'm not gonna say

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,960
the most boring papers but definitely

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,610
one of the more challenging to get

15
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,079
through so I appreciate all of you

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,370
showing up so on that note I'm home and

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,129
Eddie Guerrero Sally Chronicle security

18
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:47,430
now I have to issue a couple of

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,030
disclaimers like I said the paper is

20
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,489
extensive by that I mean it's massive

21
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,440
I'm really I have to apologize to Helen

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,230
who has to do the terrible job of

23
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,640
actually copy editing that monster for

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,739
those of you that care to read it it

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,390
covers all kinds of stuff you know I

26
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,770
assure you it's very interesting very

27
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,600
worth your time

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,560
that said it's it I don't begrudge you

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,049
if you don't go through it it does mean

30
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,990
that for this talk I am kind of gonna

31
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,610
give a conceptual overview of what's

32
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,409
going on in the paper I am NOT gonna

33
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:26,970
treat any of it as extensively as I'd

34
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,979
like to because I would need three times

35
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,689
the amount of time that I have and I

36
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:32,220
want to get to questions and I want to

37
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,520
kind of at least give you a nice TL DR

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,560
so it feels like I'm asking you to just

39
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,960
believe me I don't mean it to be that

40
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,520
way I just have so much to cover that

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,350
I'm hoping that I can do kind of an

42
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,170
overview so like I said this is the

43
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,390
short and sweet version of it so let's

44
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,840
talk about a PT's everybody's favorite

45
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,310
type of operations

46
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,580
there's a reason why so many of us care

47
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,960
about every tease there are so many apt

48
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,060
talks and for this particular conference

49
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,240
that has evolved so many old school

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,970
malware researchers I'm sure that you've

51
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,100
seen sort of the trend over time and how

52
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,280
things have changed to sort of obsess

53
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,320
over these types of operations rather

54
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,820
than a lot of crime where and a lot of

55
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,510
different more trivial seeming bits of

56
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,330
malware it's because in a lot of ways

57
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,230
that the the material is more rewarding

58
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,610
it rewards a lot of thought a lot of

59
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,380
deep dive but it all and it also

60
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,790
Garner's a lot of immediate attention

61
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,680
which is something that gets us into

62
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,050
trouble as well so it also means that

63
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,500
apt releases or information about this

64
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,660
type of research tends to be contrived

65
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,209
it can be oversimplified and more

66
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,739
importantly I think it's problematically

67
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:52,510
static and that's this sort of like

68
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,070
conflict between static and dynamic is

69
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,420
something that it's gonna be a theme

70
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,500
throughout the talk and a theme

71
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,910
throughout the paper because if I have

72
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,910
to kind of summarize all this into one

73
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,959
big takeaway it's to say that I try to

74
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,390
encourage each and all of you to start

75
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,070
to think about adversary profiling in a

76
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:15,110
dynamic way so where this all started is

77
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,480
that there seems to be the sort of

78
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,080
pervasive distaste with the idea of

79
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,310
sophisticated operation sophisticated

80
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,090
malware sophisticated campaigns for

81
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,390
those of you that are you know kind of

82
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,410
might scratch your heads at the thought

83
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,780
it doesn't actually denote any of the

84
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,590
things you might think of as

85
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,209
sophisticated it's not about how

86
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:37,180
cultured something is it is enough how

87
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,140
sort of highfalutin malware the idea is

88
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,970
rather to say that we want free PR this

89
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,790
is so amazing so great that you should

90
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,500
pay attention to this thing that we are

91
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,920
looking at alternatively what people

92
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,260
tend to mean by a sophisticate operation

93
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,670
is to kind of equate it with the sense

94
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,190
of an act of God and that's important

95
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,049
because we are getting to a point where

96
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:05,359
our industry is embracing the notion of

97
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:08,000
cyber risk insurance and

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,860
the idea that he'll you know we can't

99
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,780
defend ourselves so someone should just

100
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,370
pay the bill when somebody breaks a

101
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,130
bunch of stuff so it means that for

102
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,350
those doing incident response coming on

103
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,480
and saying yeah you know for the

104
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,880
six-figure con you know check that you

105
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,060
just cut me I can say that this is the

106
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,130
equivalent of an act of God and it's not

107
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,850
your fault that you got popped it's a

108
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,970
kind of perverse incentive for

109
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,990
describing operations is more

110
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,030
sophisticated than they actually are so

111
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,980
sophisticated for those of us in the

112
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,750
industry for a bit tends to kind of

113
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,000
invoke this sort of viral notion like oh

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,600
we hate it

115
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,520
however we are kind of constricted we

116
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,960
complain about this all the time I've

117
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,670
complained about it plenty but I end up

118
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,770
using the term as well and I think that

119
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,150
that kind of points to a sort of

120
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,930
deficiency of language that it is it has

121
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,090
become the de-facto way to describe

122
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,040
something that we genuinely mean which

123
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,870
is there is something impressive about

124
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,919
this thing we are seeing a sort of level

125
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,660
of resource of sophistication that is

126
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,180
worthy of a greater amount of thoughts

127
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,390
and pause but I think that you know we

128
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,700
could probably find better ways to to do

129
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,980
that so I wanted to focus particularly

130
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,320
on the notion of how we describe these

131
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,930
adversaries and how we could do that

132
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,280
better so right now I think part of the

133
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,020
problem is that we draw a great deal

134
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,180
from military analogies that shouldn't

135
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,450
be a surprise a lot of threat Intel

136
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,510
researchers are coming from the IC from

137
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,000
the military they've done a lot of great

138
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,650
work inside of you know DoD or

139
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,010
Department of State and you with that

140
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,240
you learn a great deal of sort of

141
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,850
doctrine but it also means that you're

142
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,680
used to things that are more common in

143
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,479
that military space like a static

144
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,150
adversary or doctrine Arian views about

145
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,650
what the configurations of those

146
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,270
adversaries are there are certain types

147
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,620
of institutions or certain types of

148
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,320
players it also means that you can have

149
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,900
conventional thinking about well the

150
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,430
thinking of the adversary and also their

151
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,020
logistics what they need to do in order

152
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,940
to initiate an action a campaign and so

153
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,580
on and it also tends to imply rational

154
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,349
incentives which is why people are sort

155
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:20,490
of so befuddled by some of the lower

156
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,729
and we're you know crazy or irrational

157
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:27,150
actors in cyberspace I think it's it

158
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,830
says more about our expectation of

159
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,389
rationality than it says about the

160
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,919
irrationality of the actors that were

161
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,349
studying so let's consider an

162
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:35,729
alternative rather than complaining

163
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,139
let's you know I wanted to kind of put

164
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,560
forward a different analogy that we

165
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,660
might be able to apply as a sort of de

166
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,060
facto methodology instead of continuing

167
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,160
to just complain and use the same stuff

168
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,599
everybody else has been using forever

169
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:51,090
I have to admit I've never seen CSI

170
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,580
cyber but it was it was very fitting in

171
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,979
a sense you know it's kind of like a not

172
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:59,310
quite but kinda really it's a caricature

173
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,900
of what I do want to suggest which is

174
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,340
the notion of criminal behavioral

175
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,340
profiling so we're all especially for

176
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,580
anybody who's really into like to use

177
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,080
the South Park term informative murder

178
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,659
porn for anybody who's really interested

179
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:14,250
in this sort of like true crime dramas

180
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,930
in these notions where we have become

181
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,840
really familiar with the idea of

182
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,580
detective work and criminal profilers

183
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,810
and what happens when you're dealing

184
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,250
with sort of violent crimes and you

185
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,099
don't know who the perpetrator is I am

186
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:27,960
in no way really qualified to describe

187
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,820
criminal behavioural profiling in depth

188
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,500
to you but I can at least give you sort

189
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,419
of a skeleton of what we might use going

190
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,750
forward so if you think about it it it

191
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,270
what it entails is describing unknown

192
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,969
perpetrators for casting risk based on

193
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:45,419
behaviors traits targeting procedures at

194
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,400
providing an output that's meant to help

195
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,520
investigations so if you just for the

196
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,139
purposes of this conversation if we take

197
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,280
that as a definition of criminal

198
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,650
behavior profiling I know it is not a

199
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,599
nun controversial science it is not a

200
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,400
nun problematic thing to discuss but for

201
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,110
the purposes of this talk if we just

202
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,050
focus that on that as our definition

203
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,520
then we can say that it sounds fairly

204
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,900
familiar to what we're already doing

205
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,360
infrared Intel and I think that

206
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,180
therefore it can do a lot to guide us so

207
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,669
the operating thesis of criminal

208
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:15,930
behavior profiling is the idea that

209
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,479
behavior reflects personality we don't

210
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,699
know who the perpetrator is but at least

211
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:23,430
by observing their behaviors and how

212
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,110
they acted in a given you know crime

213
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,380
scene situation crime spree etc we

214
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,070
should be able to devise a profile with

215
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,270
certain level of fidelity of who that

216
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,049
person may

217
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:40,529
be so what's the primary goal of of this

218
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:43,708
sort of profiling attributing no it's

219
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,510
not and I think that's really important

220
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,980
for us to keep in mind because right now

221
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,810
we've gone that way of sort of being

222
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,570
obsessed with identity or institutional

223
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,500
attribution

224
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,570
like I said we're taking a lot from

225
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,149
military stick thinking and it makes

226
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:58,260
sense that people working for

227
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,579
governments that have access to de

228
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:02,160
marshes and retribution would want to

229
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,680
know who they're dealing with but when

230
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,390
you shift into the private sector threat

231
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,800
intel on the whole point of it is just

232
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,959
to give defenders a leg up I don't know

233
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,730
that it necessarily makes sense or that

234
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,050
it's even all that valuable and we might

235
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,579
even have a conversation about how it

236
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:16,709
derails research a lot of the time to

237
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:19,200
think that we know what organization or

238
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,950
person is involved so yeah I'm not

239
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,570
telling you like let people get away

240
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,790
with murder but the idea is if we're

241
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,620
gonna model ourselves after these type

242
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,300
of profilers we also understand that

243
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,290
there's a segmentation of

244
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,450
responsibilities it's not up to the

245
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,640
profilers to say that's the murderer

246
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,730
that might be the case in television but

247
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,410
it isn't the case in how you segment an

248
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,510
investigation and I think that's really

249
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,130
important for us to understand from the

250
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,510
print of perspectives throughout Intel

251
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:50,579
investigations so the idea the primary

252
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:52,920
goal is actually to generate hypotheses

253
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,040
that are used to narrow nominal pools

254
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,660
for those wondering what we mean by a

255
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,370
nominal pool it just means you know a

256
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,260
list of names so if you think about it

257
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,000
if we have a database of potential

258
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,550
perpetrators and that database is three

259
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,380
million strong three million people in

260
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,029
the city of Chicago somebody committed a

261
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:11,339
crime the idea is that you're providing

262
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,100
as sort of generative hypotheses or a

263
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,480
profile that's gonna allow you to take

264
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,820
three million down to two thousand or to

265
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,490
two hundred and you say you know a sort

266
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,380
of testable observable way this person

267
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,180
has to you know have a familiarity with

268
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,980
this neighborhood and be interested in

269
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,060
this kind of thing and maybe have this

270
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,230
kind of psychological criminal

271
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,480
background etc but it isn't meant to say

272
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,769
it was so and so so if we were to take

273
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:38,160
that and think about what those profiles

274
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,560
are those profilers are actually

275
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,890
outputting the idea is that the testable

276
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,470
profile can adapt to new information it

277
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,760
is meant

278
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,330
compensate for the analyst bias and it

279
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,890
also has an expectation of further

280
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,300
incidents which i think is really

281
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,550
important because you know remember

282
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,080
where we're coming from I'm trying to

283
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,430
criticize this notion of sort of a

284
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,590
static profile of who the threat actor

285
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,000
is and I think that's particularly

286
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,350
problematic with a lot of our

287
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,120
publications where we release something

288
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,640
with static indicators and it's almost

289
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,170
like we're expecting the the threat

290
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,060
actors to just be like oh someone

291
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,560
published something on us I guess it's

292
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,360
time to give up and it doesn't work that

293
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,630
way so it's important to accept that

294
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,030
sort of dynamic notion so what would it

295
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,920
look like to adapt that sort of

296
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,950
methodology to cyber threat actors in

297
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,290
particular I think you know I wanted to

298
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,000
suggest this as an operating thesis as a

299
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,530
sort of analogue to the thesis that we

300
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,150
just discussed which is to say

301
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,950
operational behavior and tooling

302
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,410
reflects adversary configuration and

303
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,660
imperatives maybe it sounds like just a

304
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,880
fancier way of saying exactly what the

305
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,010
the profilers were saying but I think

306
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,950
it's it's it's a it's an operating

307
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,720
thesis that we should consider to say

308
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,110
that the tooling and what the you know

309
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,300
the behaviors of the operators actually

310
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,250
reflect the kind of organization

311
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,770
involved the kind of resources involved

312
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:02,240
and sort of their general configuration

313
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,860
so instead of identifying a person or an

314
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,780
institution what we want is to be able

315
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,210
to create a dynamic profile that is in a

316
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,310
sense testable based on concrete

317
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:16,380
research observations and as I pointed

318
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,660
to before the notion is to try to

319
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,330
understand the adversarial configuration

320
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,910
it isn't to say so and so is the FSB or

321
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,550
so and so as the NSA but rather because

322
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,250
that is an oversimplification by Miles

323
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,560
but rather to say this is the kind of

324
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,660
organization that goes about their

325
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,640
campaigns in this way has their tooling

326
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,230
internalized externalise has their

327
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,630
development you know with this range of

328
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:45,510
resources and so on so at the end of the

329
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,550
day even though there might be you know

330
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,680
100 possible institutions or a thousand

331
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,650
possible perpetrators or nation-state

332
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,120
operations there's actually a much

333
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,660
smaller set of possible configurations

334
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,880
of organizations that can pull off

335
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,350
nation-state attacks

336
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,240
so I think it's much more important to

337
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,220
be able to approximate what that

338
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,690
configuration is at least from the

339
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,070
perspective of defenders that are going

340
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,450
to need to direct their resources so

341
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,180
what's the main differentiator I think

342
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,460
at each strata of how a nation-state

343
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,800
campaign is organized the main

344
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,940
differentiator seems to be

345
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,950
externalization versus internalization

346
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,150
and I think that that's a really

347
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,380
important differentiator when we're

348
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,060
talking about nation-states that might

349
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,270
be you know on the lower socioeconomic

350
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,880
scale and trying to embrace cyber or

351
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,620
they might have very little experience

352
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,230
versus a lot of experience you know 10

353
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,910
years 15 years of experience in cyber

354
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,740
and they might you know be drawing from

355
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,450
a military background and access to

356
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,430
military defense contractors versus you

357
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,440
know buying $50 rats or using open

358
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,170
source stuff the main differentiator

359
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,420
there almost always comes down to have

360
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,400
they internalize this part of their ops

361
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,160
or externalize that so instead of just

362
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,050
saying hey this is we think this is a

363
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,660
nation-state group well are we talking

364
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,760
about tasking that is internal or

365
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,700
external as in to say do we have a you

366
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,950
know are we talking about you know the

367
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,020
official arm of a state organization or

368
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,310
are we talking about a mercenary group

369
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,020
and you might ask you know how do we

370
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,820
know this from the perspective of threat

371
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,180
research well are we seeing a group

372
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,300
whose tasking is mixed like are they

373
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,980
doing the kind of operations that you

374
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,260
might expect from someone with a

375
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,990
singular remit or are they doing several

376
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,340
different types of jobs under the

377
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,910
umbrella of a single operating group

378
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,340
instead of saying well resourced why

379
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,690
don't we discuss what their tool

380
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,820
development cycle looks like I mean for

381
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,170
a lot of these operations we've seen

382
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,970
them operate for years at a time we've

383
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,740
seen them evolve their malware we've

384
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,870
seen them actually change their coding

385
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,670
traits for a great deal and that

386
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,320
actually lets you know a lot about the

387
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,720
operational tempo and resources above an

388
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,430
organisation beyond whether they have

389
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,880
zero days or not that's also to say do

390
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,860
we believe that the tooling is actually

391
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,190
internalized or externalized and I think

392
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,210
there's gonna be a little complicated

393
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,980
with the clicker but you know are we

394
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,510
talking about the kind of stuff where

395
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,970
you know we expect cots malware

396
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,470
off-the-shelf malware are we talking

397
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,450
about customized but really open source

398
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,819
malware or self-managed

399
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:16,169
structure the kind of stuff that tends

400
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:17,669
to get a lot of these groups into

401
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:19,199
trouble where like you know you'll

402
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,809
register a cnc to an IP range that's

403
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:26,579
owned by the government of whatever

404
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,949
country or are they just using primarily

405
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:31,259
hack VPSs and the kind of low resource

406
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:34,259
stuff or are we talking about you know

407
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:35,639
somebody that's externalized their

408
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,169
tooling cycle like they might use a

409
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,359
mid-level commercial malware producer

410
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:41,850
like you know philip was talking about

411
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,689
hacking team or gamma group or even NSO

412
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:47,549
or are we talking about somebody that's

413
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:49,470
access to high-level commercial malware

414
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,549
development the kind of stuff that you

415
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,259
might expect from defense contractors

416
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:54,329
which is tends to be the most impressive

417
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,869
kind of malware that we see very

418
00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:59,999
high-end customizable frameworks and

419
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,850
most importantly probably very expensive

420
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,779
frameworks which means that you treat

421
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,819
them in a very different way right like

422
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:07,919
when you're talking about burning a

423
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,199
hacking team sample yes you are messing

424
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,549
with somebody that you have a contract

425
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:12,749
with but they also have a contractual

426
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:14,309
obligation to continue to supply you

427
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:17,729
with malware that's undetectable whereas

428
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:20,129
when you buy a framework from a defense

429
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:22,350
contractor you have a vested interest in

430
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,329
a sense in keeping that massive

431
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:26,489
investment safe so that you can use it

432
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:30,419
for a longer period of time also we tend

433
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:31,589
to see sort of more automated

434
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:33,269
infrastructure management with a lot of

435
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:35,399
these higher-end externalized groups and

436
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,970
you might even be in a position to use

437
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,429
the sort of like anonymization

438
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:43,409
infrastructure that's also managed by an

439
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:46,619
external company so the idea is that you

440
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:49,379
are segmenting your ops and in the

441
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,029
higher ends of development you are

442
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:53,369
essentially saying you are best suited

443
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:55,679
to manage this part of my OP so you do

444
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,659
this you do that you do that and then we

445
00:16:57,659 --> 00:16:59,069
sort of coalesce things with sort of

446
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:02,009
internal tasking similarly what is there

447
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:05,069
owed a burn rate like for a long time

448
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,329
the idea whether somebody was

449
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,859
sophisticated or not was oh they have

450
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,779
access to zero days and sure I mean

451
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,000
that's that's cool that does put you in

452
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,159
a certainly at least of you know having

453
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,319
a certain amount of money to spend but

454
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,500
what about what extent of O'Dea adoption

455
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,909
are we talking our I mean are you the

456
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:22,648
kind of person that gets lucky and gets

457
00:17:22,648 --> 00:17:24,569
one zero day and then it's gone and like

458
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:27,388
you're done with that sort of well

459
00:17:27,388 --> 00:17:28,470
resourced

460
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,390
stands or are we talking about somebody

461
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,909
like like sofa Capt 28 so our team where

462
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:35,460
you know like Brian Bartholomew I likes

463
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,820
to say it's a an ode a PEZ dispenser

464
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,470
like you know just gonna burn through

465
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,330
different zero days in a month you know

466
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,770
three different ones I think it says a

467
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,150
lot about your organization and their

468
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,809
prerogatives so and like I said instead

469
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:50,429
of saying sophisticated you know are we

470
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:51,720
talking about somebody who's ops are

471
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,640
automated are they doing victim box

472
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,770
operations in a sense that leaves no

473
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,600
room for failure are they doing

474
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,220
automated cleanup are they doing

475
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,020
automated delivery and sort of a secure

476
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,600
way or do they make manual mistakes and

477
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,950
this is actually quite important because

478
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,909
even some of the most sophisticated

479
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:08,909
actors like Duke who have been you know

480
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:10,320
observed to make a lot of manual

481
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,600
mistakes on keyboard you know mistakes

482
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,890
when they were handling some of the

483
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,720
their C and C's and it tells you

484
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,220
something about the organization the

485
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,960
type of operators involved so the

486
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,190
tracing behaviors that make up a

487
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,620
testable profile are observable and

488
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,049
adversary proficiencies and deficiencies

489
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:29,700
and a lot of those proficiencies and

490
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,890
deficiencies are visible to us when

491
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,600
we're doing our research some of them

492
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,900
are quite simple you know what level of

493
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,309
proficiency that the developers have

494
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:39,870
with a certain programming language oh

495
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,000
you know we've seen six months of

496
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,830
development in C++ and then they shift

497
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,840
it over to C or like they've shifted

498
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,549
over to golang or they've shifted over

499
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:49,530
there's evidence that we've got two

500
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,150
development groups involved one that

501
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,559
likes to use like with with the

502
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,320
Lambert's one that likes to use you know

503
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,940
a certain type of C++ development the

504
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,380
other ones like to use an old school

505
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,840
like STL library style development that

506
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,240
went out in the mid-90s it tells you a

507
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,740
lot about the kind of people that are

508
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,559
involved in a sense and I the the the

509
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,330
raw information is there but we're not

510
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,159
necessarily coalescing that into the

511
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:13,799
profile of the actors that we form so

512
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,559
why is the dynamic profile important

513
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,940
because threat actors change and

514
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,830
sometimes they change drastically and in

515
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,950
a sense we're inciting that change so if

516
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,090
we're trying to provide something that

517
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,010
has lasting value for customers and

518
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,210
defenders and we're trying to provide an

519
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,760
advantage long term the idea of

520
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,409
providing sort of a static profile

521
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:33,120
doesn't make a lot of sense it basically

522
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,970
means that our research output is old by

523
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,870
the time that it is delivered so I

524
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,920
talked about the right actors changing

525
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,510
what do I mean by that I mean the

526
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,950
changes can be quite drastic to the

527
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,210
sense of you know developers and

528
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,920
operators themselves might defect they

529
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,600
might retire they might die they might

530
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,440
leave they're subject to regional and

531
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,060
geopolitical schisms you know what

532
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,490
happens when you've got an a

533
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,550
nation-state team that looks to us as

534
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,560
one unified front but it's actually two

535
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,090
countries and then those countries start

536
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,150
warring with each other what happens to

537
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,920
that operational capability it's

538
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,080
something that we've seen in the past

539
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,100
especially when it comes to commercial

540
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,820
and mid-level commercial tooling

541
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,740
providers what happens with that code

542
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,610
base is repackaged or resold similarly

543
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,380
you know Kosan and i discussed this last

544
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,140
year at VB thread actors are actually

545
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,810
breached by other threat actors

546
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,190
sometimes that might result in a sort of

547
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,140
hack and leak operation but sometimes

548
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,450
that that's just a quiet breach that

549
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,070
means that somebody has access to your

550
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,710
tooling and can therefore look like you

551
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,810
while they're conducting operations if

552
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,090
they so choose to pack and leak ups

553
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,470
which we've seen a great deal of and

554
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,470
then a voluntary toolkit open sourcing

555
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,730
is something that I'm kind of dreading

556
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,530
but I don't think it's entirely out of

557
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,480
the realm of possibility to say you know

558
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,630
a group like a PT 28 saying hey we're

559
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,440
too hot we want to sort of damage the

560
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,270
narrative around us why don't you just

561
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:04,900
open source gamefish and just let

562
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,110
everybody look like abt 28 and hide our

563
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,560
operations in the noise there's another

564
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,150
thing when dynamics I'm gonna start kind

565
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,050
of rushing through some of these ideas

566
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,880
because I do want to leave some time for

567
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,460
questions but when we talk about

568
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,020
adversary sort of starting on the low

569
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,180
end usually they tend to kind of prove

570
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,770
their worth and then their resources

571
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,270
become more abundant on a nation-state

572
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,030
scale that doesn't only move in one

573
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,650
direction sometimes they become more

574
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,420
abundant you can buy hacking team and

575
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,650
then things don't go well with the

576
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,270
government or you didn't really turn out

577
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,490
results and resources become scarce

578
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,500
again and it's quite interesting because

579
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,120
you see somebody that might have have

580
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,670
access to a certain kind of medium

581
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,190
sophistication tooling no longer have

582
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,900
access legitimate access to that tooling

583
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,550
but they still have the experience so

584
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,990
you start to see sort of the evolution

585
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,270
of that threat actor as their tooling

586
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,510
changes and a lot of other things on

587
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:55,870
attempt

588
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,660
happen so if the object of study by

589
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,210
definition changes if it's malleable if

590
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,340
it's in flux then the output of our

591
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,990
research must in itself also be

592
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,850
adaptable and I think that's quite

593
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,100
important also for the sake of breaking

594
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,440
this cycle of hit-and-run research for

595
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,730
anybody that's actually had to do any

596
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,770
kind of hardcore defense of a very well

597
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,130
targeted Network I'm sure that our

598
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:20,890
research output must feel us like a sort

599
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,530
of hidden runner like somebody gets very

600
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,360
interested in a threat actor that my

601
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,120
organization is defending against all of

602
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,530
a sudden I have all this help I have all

603
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,600
this visibility and just as quickly as

604
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,700
it came it's gone everyone's like well

605
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,070
you know NSO is yesterday's news and

606
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,870
we're moving on to the next thing what

607
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,400
happens to these defenders when what

608
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,110
they're left with is a series of IOC s

609
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,450
that are now obsolete a series of yarra

610
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,950
rules that are probably now being

611
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,720
circumvented a series of detections that

612
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,460
are being circumvented and knowledge of

613
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,160
a code base that is evolving I think as

614
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,650
as Philips presentation quite cleverly

615
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,500
put so in order to provide sort of the

616
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,480
best possible advantage to people with a

617
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,280
vested interest in actually defending

618
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,840
themselves which are essentially the

619
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,720
customers of threat Intel production we

620
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,100
need to be able to provide a sort of

621
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,600
research output that's designed to be

622
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,179
competently continued by others and I

623
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:11,470
think that's a point at which we need to

624
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,270
kind of figure out how to play nice with

625
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,640
one another like the notion of

626
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,740
information sharing is a sort of

627
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,350
academic idea that you know it's sort of

628
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,090
nice and flowery but we've all proven

629
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:25,540
that no threat and sorry no no threat

630
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,179
Intel research out outfit is gonna come

631
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:29,710
out and say yeah I'll give you all of my

632
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,600
visibility it's my competitive advantage

633
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,100
but yes you know you can have it and we

634
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,540
can all share and sing Kumbaya

635
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,850
and like do the same research so if

636
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,260
that's not gonna happen

637
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,300
then at least let's have the output

638
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,370
beyond the sort of dynamic platforms

639
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,380
that continue to track things be in the

640
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,030
sort of format that allows people to say

641
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,070
hey I base my conjectures on these

642
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:51,760
indicators you go forth and if you want

643
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,230
to continue to study this thing that I

644
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,540
am no longer going to study there's a

645
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,250
sort of continuity and compatibility

646
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,080
about but that allows people to

647
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,530
competently continue that research so

648
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,210
you know I want to leave some time for

649
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,670
questions and like I said if you want

650
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,340
something some examples of alternative

651
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,850
profiling of what weak

652
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,650
do with a sort of different methodology

653
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,289
what I did was the same as criminal

654
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:16,809
profilers might go back and visit known

655
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:18,490
perpetrators of crimes and sort of an

656
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,590
you know interview them and try to get a

657
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,179
different sense of what they did why

658
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:25,090
they did what they did for me that the

659
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,559
equivalent of that was going back to

660
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,020
very competent research amazing research

661
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,789
by a lot of different people about a lot

662
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:33,039
of different research groups and to sort

663
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,870
of try to comb through them again and

664
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,640
say what did we miss what could have we

665
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,500
put together what was available for a

666
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,289
profile that we just kind of didn't put

667
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:42,669
together because we were and look at it

668
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:45,400
with the you know with that mentality so

669
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,480
some of the examples that are gonna be

670
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,710
in the paper or sort of the schism

671
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,809
between red October and Cloud Atlas

672
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:51,580
what profiling we could have done of

673
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,140
equations operational prerogatives

674
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,669
mostly based on a lot of their cleanup

675
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:58,210
mistakes and and not different dynamics

676
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,100
of abt disappearance and resurgence so

677
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,600
apt is like a death row Animal Farm

678
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,360
dooku flame that you know sort of where

679
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,429
burn disappeared and you know most of

680
00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:08,200
them didn't ever come back except for

681
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,880
Dooku where we have an example of a

682
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,409
complete disappearance and a complete

683
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,600
retooled resurgence which might be the

684
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,340
only case of an apt doing that that I

685
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,720
know of

686
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,059
similarly why the Lambert's of John

687
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,190
Lambert Fame are probably the best

688
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,919
segment of thread actor ever and how we

689
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,559
all got read and wrong which is I think

690
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,659
a big claim considering the astounding

691
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:30,460
quality of research that the industry

692
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,020
put forward on that so if you're

693
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,620
interested in all those things read the

694
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,120
paper because I don't really have time

695
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,780
to talk about any of them and with that

696
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,820
I will be happy to use the last few

697
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,350
minutes for questions
