1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,940
okay we're ready to get started our next

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,460
presentation is by mocchi oh gosh

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,400
I'll try it again musashi nishihara and

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,859
john scott Railton from citizens lab

5
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:27,930
please welcome them to the stage thanks

6
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,699
so much for the introduction I'm

7
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,470
massaging to Shahadah this is John Scott

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,210
Railton we're from the citizen lab at

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,460
the University of Toronto and what we

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,870
want to talk to you about today is

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,840
targeted threats affecting civil society

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,239
what's happening to them and what we can

13
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,950
do and we're going to give that to you

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,350
in four different ways we're gonna tell

15
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,899
you a good story to set the stage and

16
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,789
the context then we're going to give you

17
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,949
an analogy to zoom out and try to better

18
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,110
understand the situation that civil

19
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,820
society is in when it comes to

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,670
information security threats then we're

21
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,100
gonna present some evidence from cases

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,438
that we have done and then discuss the

23
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,030
ongoing challenges that civil society

24
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,090
faces and what the security industry and

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,439
what the colleagues in the room today

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,790
could do to help improve so I'll pass it

27
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,880
off now to John for the story we just

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,680
discovered that it looks like the font

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,689
has been converted on our presentation

30
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,130
so we're gonna have all kinds of fun

31
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,380
Easter eggs here somewhere in the

32
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,960
process so it'll be discovery for me too

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,610
all right meet Omar Omar lives a few

34
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,720
hundred miles from where we're sitting

35
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,640
right now in Quebec

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,079
he's a university student he is also a

37
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:43,170
critic of Saudi Arabia Omar came to

38
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,229
Canada and became critical of the Saudi

39
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,210
government's human rights record quite

40
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,159
vocally and has amassed a substantial

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,100
following on YouTube saying his

42
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,049
criticisms more recently though

43
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:59,159
Omar under pressure from the Saudi

44
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,579
government requested and received asylum

45
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,689
in Canada and is today a Canadian

46
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:10,619
permanent resident not too long ago this

47
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:10,979
summer

48
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,350
Omar ordered a large tub

49
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,730
of delicious protein and surely after

50
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,830
ordering it received a text message on

51
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,300
his pants computer with shipment

52
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,600
tracking information it actually was not

53
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,150
shipment tracking information this was a

54
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,180
malicious SMS confirmed by my colleague

55
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,870
bill marzack who led this research in

56
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,050
fact this was malware this was NSO's

57
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,310
Pegasus so people mention Pegasus in the

58
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,560
last talk Philip evoked it this is

59
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,660
basically a sophisticated piece of

60
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,210
government exclusive spyware that can

61
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,740
take control of a device it has a bunch

62
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,420
of neat anti forensics features a lot of

63
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,990
other cool stuff

64
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,150
man this fonts gonna be amazing it's

65
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,760
developed by an Esso group which pitches

66
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,170
itself as an Israeli cyber warfare

67
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,540
company and is owned by a San Francisco

68
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,880
based private equity firm and if the

69
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,260
animations on this are bort this is

70
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,460
gonna be really interesting back in 2016

71
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,650
my colleagues and I first discovered

72
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,350
NSO's Pegasus in the wild being used to

73
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,720
target a dissident named Ivan Mansoor

74
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,600
who is a human rights defender based in

75
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,430
the United Arab Emirates and was highly

76
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,130
critical of his government Monsour

77
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,840
received text messages as well

78
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,120
equally malicious these ones promising

79
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,020
secrets on Emiratis tortured and state

80
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,120
prisons which was a topic of his

81
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,810
advocacy but in fact those contained NSO

82
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,710
we worked with Mansoor and with Lookout

83
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,740
and Apple and determined that the

84
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,420
malware that was targeting him used a

85
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,880
chain of three zero day vulnerabilities

86
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,290
to infect devices in 2017 we continued

87
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,950
investigating NSO and determined that

88
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,070
the Mexican NSO operator had massively

89
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,530
targeted Mexican civil society with this

90
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,470
exclusive piece of kit media law public

91
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,200
health government Anti Corruption

92
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,640
even investigators of mass killings so

93
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,700
fast forward to 2018 work led by my

94
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,060
colleague bill used a really

95
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,270
cool technique DNS cache probing as well

96
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,340
as global scanning to come up with a map

97
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,730
of countries where at least one NSO

98
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,160
Pegasus victim was located we get a map

99
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,300
that looks like this so a lot of

100
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,330
countries with people whose devices have

101
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,190
been targeted with Pegasus

102
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:47,720
more recently in a report published on

103
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,210
Monday one of the Pegasus customers one

104
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,410
of the NSO of customers that we found

105
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,830
had a series of infections in a bunch of

106
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,310
different countries including Canada so

107
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,010
drilling into that the Canadian

108
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,540
infection had an interesting property

109
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,810
which is it bounced between two networks

110
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,850
so it bounced between videotron which is

111
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,820
a québécois network and risk which is an

112
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,590
academic network that provides services

113
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,169
to universities in Quebec so we had an

114
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:19,400
infection that would show up in one

115
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,400
network we can there disappear show up

116
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,320
again on the risk of Network and the

117
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,300
question was would it be possible to

118
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,130
identify a victim just based on this

119
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,919
weird pattern of life and the answer is

120
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:32,470
yes it was

121
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:37,490
here's omar so Omar had a daily routine

122
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,370
of activity passing from home to

123
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,690
University campus for an evening

124
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,270
activity that exactly matched the

125
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,850
pattern of life of the infection that we

126
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,930
observed which allowed us to conclude

127
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,270
that Omar have been successfully

128
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,729
targeted with an SOS Pegasus and on

129
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:54,560
Monday we released a fun little report

130
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,150
the kingdom came to Canada which I

131
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,220
encourage you all to read which lays out

132
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,620
exactly the methodology that we used for

133
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,300
this finding I don't want to talk too

134
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,650
much about this in a great detail

135
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,200
because this is the work primarily of

136
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,340
Bill who's gonna do a full presentation

137
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,440
on this at a later time but with that

138
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,850
I'm gonna turn this over to Masashi

139
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,940
so thanks John so from that story let's

140
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,889
zoom out now and look at the wider

141
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:18,620
context of digital espionage operations

142
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,660
affecting civil society and what I'm

143
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,550
going to do is build out an analogy to

144
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,620
help us understand the situation that

145
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:30,169
they're in so this is a figure from a

146
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:32,479
secure works report published in 2017

147
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,210
and it shows the distribution of targets

148
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,080
for an apt 28 linked operation so what

149
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,980
you can see here

150
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,310
is amongst the targets a third our civil

151
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,980
society represented here by journalists

152
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,200
nongovernmental organizations and

153
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,480
political activists and while you might

154
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,850
see references like this to civil

155
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,220
society in industry reports it is very

156
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,370
rare to have any detail on why they were

157
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,710
targeted what the impact of the

158
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,820
targeting may be and how their defenses

159
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,000
and experiences may differ from industry

160
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,970
and government this is a figure from

161
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,150
some of our own reporting also on a

162
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,870
different apt 28 linked operation and in

163
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,090
this case again we see a roughly

164
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,330
comparable targeting of civil society

165
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,370
when you compare that to industry

166
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,830
military and government in this case

167
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,070
civil society means academics activists

168
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,310
journalists and others so what is it

169
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,970
really that we're looking at here well

170
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,100
we have the same threat actor in this

171
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,010
case a PT 28 targeting a range of

172
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,720
organizations from different sectors

173
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,020
Viet government military private sector

174
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,190
and civil society

175
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,520
what makes civil society different well

176
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,450
they are much much softer targets than

177
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,120
these other types of groups now why is

178
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,570
that the case that points to an inherent

179
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,180
asymmetry in information security that

180
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,450
civil society finds itself dealing with

181
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:15,200
it is cheap to connect but it's

182
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,110
expensive to secure so what does that

183
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,640
mean in practical terms

184
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,410
for your average non-governmental

185
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,080
organization group well what that means

186
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,290
is that you're running what you could

187
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,090
consider your ultimate bring your own

188
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,700
device environment so for many of these

189
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,860
groups there is no IT department or

190
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,380
there might be very very limited staff

191
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,169
with a mix of technical skills at best

192
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,080
these groups in general have limited

193
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,810
resources and time they have little

194
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,900
access to user and staff behavior to

195
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,640
better understand how threats are

196
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,430
getting into the organization and often

197
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,720
have very poor

198
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,879
combination of the systems that they're

199
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:58,939
using so what are the consequences of

200
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,889
being in this kind of environment well

201
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:02,990
here's the analogy let's think about

202
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,250
this in the context of Public Health so

203
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,069
where there is no working Health System

204
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:13,250
all kinds of preventable and curable

205
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,220
infections can become catastrophic for a

206
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,189
population so let's just further

207
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:22,129
illustrate this this figure here is

208
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,379
showing the number of deaths due to

209
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:26,540
infectious diseases around the world

210
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,379
over a timespan of the last 200 years so

211
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:31,699
you see the biggest circle is

212
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:34,069
tuberculosis with a billion deaths and

213
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:36,889
then it goes down for other types of

214
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:40,490
diseases tuberculosis of course is a

215
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,459
preventable and curable disease but

216
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:44,930
despite that remains one of the

217
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,529
deadliest diseases in the world and each

218
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:51,470
year kills a million or more people on

219
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,720
average so let's compare that to

220
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,769
something like Ebola Ebola of course

221
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:59,839
there is no cure it is a terrifying

222
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,420
disease it can have devastating effects

223
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,329
on a population but when you look at the

224
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:08,839
impact we're seeing a bit over 11,000

225
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:10,699
deaths and you're comparing that to a

226
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:14,269
billion so of course researching

227
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:16,610
something like Ebola could be very

228
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,309
exciting it's important work there's a

229
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:21,829
lot of open questions and you know it's

230
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,069
a scary thing let's think about this in

231
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:28,939
the context of our industry Ebola is the

232
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:31,279
zero-days Ebola is the new exotic

233
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,379
commercial malware Ebola is the

234
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:35,839
interesting fun stuff that you want to

235
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,819
come to conferences like this and hear

236
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:39,920
about and that you want to hack on and

237
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,290
that you want to be you know the first

238
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,389
company or researcher to have a report

239
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:46,250
around and I understand that that makes

240
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,949
sense sometimes we see a bola -

241
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,870
affecting civil society like in the

242
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,439
story

243
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:54,170
that John gave but that's not what's

244
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,939
affecting people every day and that's

245
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:57,709
not where the real harm is coming from

246
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:59,660
the real harm is coming from your

247
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,540
tuberculosis your smallpox or malaria of

248
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,449
malware these are preventable curable

249
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:06,410
and

250
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,389
kind of technically boring maybe for

251
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:10,100
people that are looking at these all the

252
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,810
time but this is where the real harm

253
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:16,100
comes from so for civil society what has

254
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,190
this meant civil society is massively

255
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,980
targeted by digital espionage operations

256
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,519
these threats are technically boring but

257
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,100
they're also preventable and why is this

258
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,480
happening well it's because these

259
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,810
threats are effective so from this kind

260
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,509
of abstract analogy I want to walk you

261
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:38,389
through some evidence from our cases to

262
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:39,920
give you a better picture of what these

263
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,540
boring threats look like so here's an

264
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,550
example our fought look cooler before us

265
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,579
where that that we see all the time and

266
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:52,490
that's remote access Trojans and old day

267
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,490
exploits so not your zero days but old

268
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,660
crusty boring exploits typically these

269
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,800
kinds of threats which I'm sure

270
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,990
everybody in the room is very familiar

271
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,750
with are delivered to groups through

272
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,050
email vectors with an enticing message

273
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,990
asking you to click on a document or

274
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,389
other type of file or link which is

275
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:21,380
laden with malware so these types of

276
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,990
threats present a minimal barrier to

277
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,329
entry for operators and typically what

278
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,759
we're seeing is very very low technical

279
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:31,370
sophistication so what this means is it

280
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,560
really levels the playing field for

281
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,139
digital espionage anyone now can do it

282
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:38,569
and trust me everybody is and the

283
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:40,579
calculus for the operator is simple if

284
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:43,189
your target clicks on it you own them

285
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:46,040
and boy do they click on it the

286
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,600
consistent finding for social

287
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,809
engineering is that forty to sixty

288
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:53,240
percent of people are tricked by spear

289
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,120
phishing and this is how they're getting

290
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,279
into civil society groups this is how

291
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,439
they are penetrating movements this is

292
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:04,240
how they are compromising individuals

293
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,639
here's an example in 2014 we published a

294
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:10,480
report called communities at risk which

295
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,250
documented investigations that we did

296
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,769
with ten civil society organization

297
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:18,519
is over four years many of these groups

298
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,519
were conducting human rights activities

299
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,129
around issues in China such as the

300
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:27,670
Tibetan movement other groups were large

301
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,860
international groups who work on a

302
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,259
number of issues over that period of

303
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:35,839
time we collected over 2,000 pieces of

304
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,639
malware from 44 different malware

305
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,019
families so these were highly targeted

306
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:43,040
groups but really what we were seeing

307
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,920
was a lot of old days and think about

308
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,540
this from an operator perspective these

309
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,910
are soft targets don't burn a zero-day

310
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,040
if you don't need to if it ain't broke

311
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,279
don't fix it over this four year period

312
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,910
we found one zero day but most of what

313
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,249
we're seeing we're pretty old and crusty

314
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:04,910
the most common CVEs were 2010 33 33 and

315
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,089
2012 0 1 5 8 if anyone in the room

316
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:11,420
investigates apt style operations in

317
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,189
Asia I'm sure you're very familiar with

318
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:17,149
these exploits so let's get into a bit

319
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:19,549
of detail in this graph on one access

320
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:22,279
you see see the ease on the bottom there

321
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,549
you see time the orange dots represent

322
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:28,730
when an email was received from a group

323
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,249
so that's basically the time of the

324
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:34,240
intrusion attempt and the gray lines

325
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,339
represent when that CVE was publicly

326
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:39,799
announced so you see these two blobs

327
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:45,429
that's 2010 33 33 and 2012 0 1 5 8 and

328
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:47,559
you know these were the most common

329
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:51,170
exploits that we saw importantly 2012 0

330
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,420
1 2 5 8 was patched since April 10th

331
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,819
2012 but you can see might be a little

332
00:14:55,819 --> 00:14:57,199
bit hard to see on the scale here but

333
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,730
way past the patch day this was

334
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,240
continued to be used for years this is

335
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,980
how these operations were being

336
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,040
conducted here you see our 1 0 Day which

337
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,649
was a flash exploit and you can see the

338
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:11,749
orange dot is occurring before the

339
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:15,230
public announcement of the exploit so

340
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,689
again don't burn something if you don't

341
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:19,519
need to when you're going after a soft

342
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,139
target is the mentality of these

343
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:26,629
operators so that was from 2014 you

344
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:28,540
might ask well what has changed

345
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,910
and the answer for these groups is not

346
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,160
very much so we continue to work with

347
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,750
many of those groups from that report

348
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,640
and we've been working with groups in

349
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,040
the Tibetan diaspora and wider movement

350
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,940
for many many years so for these groups

351
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,150
they're still receiving mostly old days

352
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,340
crusty exploits we've seen a bit of

353
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,470
refreshment for this a little bit of

354
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,000
change from the operators but still

355
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,550
mostly the same we even still see 2012

356
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,670
zero one five eight used to this day

357
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,010
most of this malware is custom kit but

358
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,920
we are gradually also seeing the use of

359
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,310
some commodity rats so this is the

360
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,860
context for these particular communities

361
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,320
but what about when these kinds of

362
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,990
operations are happening within an armed

363
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,610
conflict and for that I'm going to pass

364
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,540
it on to John all right so everybody

365
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,610
hacks during a war one of the cool

366
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,310
things about looking at hacking and

367
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,870
information operations during a conflict

368
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,700
is because there's so many sides

369
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,370
motivated to see stuff you see all kinds

370
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,660
of interesting now there was a great

371
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,270
glorious animation here we'll see how

372
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,910
this plays out so we spent a lot of

373
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,850
years looking at the different actors

374
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,610
playing in the Syrian space here's a

375
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,800
little overview you have Syrian malware

376
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,530
teams the Syrian electronic army they're

377
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,660
busily targeting Syrian opposition

378
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,910
groups with malware fishing crummy

379
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,780
Android malware they're also conducting

380
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,370
sort of side hustles doing criminal

381
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,220
activity a little bit of sort of basic

382
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,860
blackmail against foreign targets who

383
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,369
they're going after then Assad regime

384
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:09,640
actors are also targeting Isis and other

385
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,310
Islamist groups that they're in physical

386
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:19,670
war with clicker clicker clicker

387
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,099
alright meanwhile Islamist groups have

388
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,050
done some sort of lightweight targeting

389
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,579
of the opposition groups that they've

390
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,319
been fighting with and then you have

391
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,470
Iranian groups Lebanese groups and

392
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,140
Russian groups all targeting the Syrian

393
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,910
opposition and finally you have the

394
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,410
Syrian opposition doing some kind of

395
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,390
crummy lightweight targeting of the

396
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,040
regime as well as because these things

397
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,290
are really fractious targeting itself

398
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,840
right so everybody everybody is hacking

399
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,100
it's really kind of like a spaghetti

400
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,280
soup of bad stuff right and then you

401
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,570
have sort of more sophisticated stuff

402
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,910
we're a little short on our time frame

403
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,950
here and this is almost illegible so

404
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,390
I'll basically tell you there are lots

405
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,630
of groups a common theme among many of

406
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,060
these groups is really bottom barrel

407
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,860
sophistication this is the sort of like

408
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,680
my cousin knows computers approach to

409
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,960
network intrusion and monitoring the

410
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,270
thing is it still works right and it

411
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,310
works because most of the people who are

412
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,140
now operating in sort of high-risk

413
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,840
environments brought with them their

414
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,000
devices their contact lists their

415
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,560
accounts their communication strategies

416
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,180
none of those things were designed to be

417
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,920
hardened and I would submit that that's

418
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,840
kind of a feature of social movements

419
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,520
and change today which is you have no

420
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,510
idea who next year's belligerents or

421
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,950
activists or others are going to be but

422
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,570
what you can say with some certainty is

423
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,180
when social disruption happens they're

424
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,560
gonna go into it with whatever

425
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,900
technology they're using so it's a great

426
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,850
opportunity to see the kind of security

427
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,980
limitations and the models of kind of

428
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,550
mass-market tech and everybody's hacking

429
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,040
all right so what does that look like in

430
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,290
practice here's some work I did in

431
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,910
collaboration with NART Villeneuve and

432
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:00,120
Dan Regalado of fire I this is an

433
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,090
awesome report called behind the Syrian

434
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,100
conflicts digital frontlines so here's a

435
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,440
transcript of an interaction a Skype

436
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,800
conversation between a victim well at

437
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,410
this moment still a target and a

438
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,450
Lebanese operator who I think we could

439
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,700
say is very likely linked to Hezbollah

440
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,730
so the operator masquerading is this

441
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,490
attractive woman asks in a Skype

442
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,840
conversation you know it's lonely when

443
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,340
you're fighting a war there's a lot of

444
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,990
like unused time right and people are

445
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,450
just sitting around on laptops right

446
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,470
they've got their satellite internet

447
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,100
connection and

448
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,809
boring and one of the biggest problems

449
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:34,860
in a conflict is how you going to find

450
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,690
the person to get married to right like

451
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,700
you know everybody's growing up and so

452
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,200
there's a fair amount of you know kind

453
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,780
of like blind dates online so into this

454
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,990
mix tumbles this interaction right are

455
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,820
you operating on Skype or on your mobile

456
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,280
the target responds right computer and

457
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,700
mobile helpfully how old are you 25 says

458
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,179
our charming avatar and you what's your

459
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:58,740
date of birth is the target perhaps a

460
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,470
little bit suspiciously 10 388 says our

461
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,530
operator wow this is the target my god

462
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:08,850
10 389 right obviously the operator had

463
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,049
some knowledge of who the target was

464
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:13,080
going into this what a nice coincidence

465
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,320
says our operator here's a picture of me

466
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,130
right you drive me crazy says the target

467
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,570
that of course was a self-extracting

468
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,190
rora file and it contained dark comet

469
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,450
which is everyone knows is obviously the

470
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,799
most sophisticated piece of malware in

471
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,870
the world right so changing our

472
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,429
perspective a little bit right here's

473
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:34,830
the target errs eye view of our

474
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,880
operation right looking at our victim

475
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,110
you know obviously the webcam could be

476
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,770
better centered on the targets face here

477
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:47,039
and then here's some Osen that the

478
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,600
operator is doing trying to confirm

479
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,720
another target again based on webcam

480
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,559
pics from this rat what kind of

481
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,120
information comes out of this hall well

482
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,580
this is a battle map this was provided

483
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,480
by foreign security service to the

484
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,799
Syrian opposition group that was hacked

485
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,650
right here's an actual battle plan that

486
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,570
I've massively redacted that shows

487
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,880
things like the location of every troop

488
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,250
what kind of guns they have right where

489
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,630
they're going to attack before they

490
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,610
attacked right those little red things

491
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,860
are hand-drawn berms right on a

492
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,340
battlefield surveillance prior to a

493
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,590
battle right so here they are monitoring

494
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,030
their opposition with a telephoto lens

495
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,490
this totally redacted thing is a list of

496
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,809
fighters along with their blood type

497
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:33,059
family members parents names really like

498
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,820
it doesn't get deeper than that so fire

499
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,110
I made this nice graphic at the time

500
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,429
showing the different categories of

501
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:41,700
information that we're stolen and this

502
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,350
included sort of military stuff

503
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,809
political stuff but all

504
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:48,759
so a big chunk of humanitarian material

505
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:51,110
why is this relevant well you know

506
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,940
conflicts have a lot of human impact and

507
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,169
a lot of the groups that we're trying to

508
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:56,990
mitigate and blunt that awful human

509
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,970
impact were among the most heavily

510
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,629
targeted group so again I make no

511
00:22:02,629 --> 00:22:04,009
apologies for the terrible font thing

512
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:05,870
that happened but the basic story here

513
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,759
is that however you're doing it right a

514
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,830
lot of players especially in a conflict

515
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,759
like that where they don't have the

516
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:13,100
ability to go buy something are gonna do

517
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,019
indirect or guerrilla SIGINT right and

518
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:16,340
they're gonna do it with rats and

519
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,419
malware right and what they bring to it

520
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:22,429
is quality deception right not

521
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:25,279
necessarily good tech the issue is

522
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,169
whatever the root harm is done so we're

523
00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:28,159
going to talk really briefly about

524
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,629
phishing that's kind of the other thing

525
00:22:29,629 --> 00:22:31,340
that we see constantly so we've been

526
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,779
mostly talking about malware based

527
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:33,889
threats right now so let's talk about

528
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:35,990
phishing so this is really the very

529
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,669
bottom of the barrel but if you think

530
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:39,919
about this for an operator trying to

531
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,600
target civil society this might not be

532
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,730
all that you need because civil society

533
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,860
is organizing mobilizing and

534
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,779
communicating on popular consumer

535
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:50,360
platforms like social networks email etc

536
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,850
so you don't necessarily need access to

537
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,289
their computer network or even their

538
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,139
device if you own their online account

539
00:22:57,139 --> 00:22:58,940
you own them and you can get information

540
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,330
about their activities that you need so

541
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,889
again we've seen this happening all over

542
00:23:03,889 --> 00:23:06,320
the world and why is this happening well

543
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,509
it's cheap and it's easy and it's

544
00:23:08,509 --> 00:23:10,879
effective and again the focus here is on

545
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:12,710
social engineering I'll briefly go

546
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,960
through a few examples where we can see

547
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,639
that the lures that are involved here

548
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:18,409
while this is you know fishing mundane

549
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:21,309
boring technically simple the lures are

550
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:24,649
pretty sophisticated so this is an

551
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:28,190
example of a phishing email that we

552
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,470
found in campaign targeting Egyptian

553
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,840
activists in this case in December of

554
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,919
2016

555
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:39,830
a prominent Egyptian lawyer was arrested

556
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,470
within hours of her arrest while she was

557
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,240
still being interrogated at the police

558
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,360
station colleagues of hers at

559
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,100
nongovernmental organizations began to

560
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,470
receive this email which claims to share

561
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,440
a document with details about her arrest

562
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,139
warrant now if you clicked on this

563
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,300
you would get this phishing page which

564
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,370
was pre-populated with the username so

565
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,590
highly specialized highly targeted and

566
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,970
something that probably people would

567
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,290
fall for in that kind of stressful

568
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:12,280
situation here is another example this

569
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,780
is from a campaign we reported earlier

570
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,690
in this year this was sent to a Tibetan

571
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,050
activist it claims to share a logo for

572
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,480
an official website of the Tibetan

573
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,010
government-in-exile which has been

574
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,690
signed and approved by the Sikh young

575
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,570
which is a Tibetan word for president or

576
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,790
a prime minister and it looks like it's

577
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,920
sharing files but they're actually links

578
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,140
so I'm sure everyone in the room can see

579
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,790
that that link is a bit suspicious but

580
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,800
you know to your average user they might

581
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,420
not think about it and they click

582
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,760
through you would get this page which

583
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,770
looks like a Google login page but of

584
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:47,650
course is not on one side the screen

585
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,200
here you see the fake login page where

586
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,020
there is all the prompts within one page

587
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,060
and of course now Google has changed

588
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,790
their login to be a to prompt system

589
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,070
again if you're an activist and you're

590
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,050
working quickly you might not think

591
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,210
about that but the real clever part

592
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,310
about this is the following trick so

593
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,960
once you put in your credentials and now

594
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,970
you're owned what happens is you are

595
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,550
redirected to benign content on Google

596
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,980
Drive in this case the very logo that

597
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,040
was promised by the email so you know a

598
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,490
clever deception to have the target not

599
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:25,840
think that anything is wrong so this is

600
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,460
just a quick snapshot of this operation

601
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,220
it was active for over 19 months and

602
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,320
again no pretty simple but they had a

603
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,510
wide infrastructure that was being used

604
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:38,380
and we collected 58 decoy documents such

605
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,270
as the one I just showed you and of

606
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,670
those 58 documents there 11 different

607
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,730
targeting themes obviously Tibet was one

608
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,560
of them but there are other human rights

609
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,360
groups that were targeted by this and

610
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,160
also governments and businesses across

611
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,000
Asia so these guys were pretty busy now

612
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,770
while we can't really estimate what the

613
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,810
human cost is in terms of running this

614
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,400
thing we can estimate what the

615
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,990
infrastructure cost was and it was

616
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,640
pretty cheap so you can run this whole

617
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,830
operation over that 19 months for just a

618
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:10,600
little over 1,000 US dollars so you know

619
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,830
while what we've been

620
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,630
showing you again is like the simplest

621
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,519
thing that you can do these operators

622
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:17,559
are facing constant evolutionary

623
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,659
pressures technology is changing you

624
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:21,370
know new security features are adding

625
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,380
are being added and that causes them to

626
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,640
pivot so we've seen instances of

627
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,529
two-factor hacking we've also started to

628
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:31,630
see malicious oo applications to get

629
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,940
access to account credentials and other

630
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,799
data from accounts don't have time to go

631
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:37,240
into those details that's just to show

632
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,820
when targets start changing defenses

633
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,830
when services start changing things

634
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,080
within their platforms these operators

635
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,130
adapt to it

636
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,190
so with those examples and giving you

637
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,019
kind of this high-level overview what's

638
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:51,610
happening with civil society what can we

639
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,799
all do in the room to make this better

640
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,659
so let's walk through the challenges and

641
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:57,519
think through what possible responses

642
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,000
could be alright so obviously if you're

643
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,769
in sort of the industry government space

644
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:04,659
maybe you approached some vendors you

645
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:05,860
talked to some experts you're heavily

646
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,419
targeted nation-state accurate going

647
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:09,850
after you right boy is there an endpoint

648
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,070
protection product for you the same is

649
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,110
not true if you're operating in civil

650
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,340
society right it's kind of the ultimate

651
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,429
where there is no IT department

652
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:19,840
environment as we said before that

653
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,039
doesn't mean that people aren't trying

654
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,450
things a lot of what they're trying

655
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,510
though looks like behavioral stuff right

656
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,399
it looks like attempts to train people's

657
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:29,529
behavior to get better and this is

658
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:30,850
attractive to a lot of people because

659
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,139
the idea is like well maybe you can

660
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:33,760
provide a training and then people will

661
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,919
be less likely to click on thing the

662
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,720
thing that we all know right is that

663
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,179
information alone doesn't share behavior

664
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:41,950
doesn't change behavior it just doesn't

665
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:42,399
work like that

666
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,820
and even in cases where behavior is

667
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,830
successfully changed there's kind of a

668
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,980
deeper problem which is it doesn't take

669
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,049
very long for an operator to change a

670
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:55,000
technique but it takes a huge amount of

671
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,789
time to change people's behavior right

672
00:27:57,789 --> 00:27:59,580
and the real talk is you can't patch

673
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,429
basic human behavior and it's reasonably

674
00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:06,010
trivial to change attacks and operations

675
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,110
and deception just enough that it still

676
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,330
kind of looks new right and if you don't

677
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,669
believe me look at the 2016 election

678
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:15,639
what's happened after that so what do

679
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:16,899
you guys do about it right like we're in

680
00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:19,929
an industry conversation here we've come

681
00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:21,610
to talk about civil society issues is

682
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,919
there something you can do oh definitely

683
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,050
right we'll tell you what we think you

684
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:29,470
can do in some ways it's a bit of a

685
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,810
snooze to talk about boring rats and

686
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,220
fishing right this is all stuff that we

687
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,600
can not along - we can all talk about

688
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,880
these behavioral things and boom the

689
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,350
fact that you know users are not going

690
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,090
to change their behaviors all of this is

691
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,740
true right and if I say to you you

692
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,790
should spend more time researching

693
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,590
boring threats it's like well I don't

694
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,880
understand what the financial incentive

695
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,320
is for that like my customers aren't

696
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,270
interested radda radda fair enough all

697
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,000
those are reasonable points I think that

698
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,220
you could still do good work and

699
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,200
exciting work while studying fairly

700
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,850
boring threats and I think the proof is

701
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,810
in the pudding like a lot of the cases

702
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:04,420
where you read a report often civil

703
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,040
society targets are living somewhere in

704
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,050
there right often when you run an

705
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,360
investigation even if it's of something

706
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,620
that you know looks like a state on

707
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,420
state operation they're going to be

708
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,090
targets that don't have a big budget

709
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,620
that are somewhere in civil society

710
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,270
whether it's journalists or politicians

711
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,160
or others the problem is there's not

712
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,960
always a lot of incentive on the vendor

713
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,930
side to talk about those targets or to

714
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,160
talk about those targets in a way that I

715
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,650
think is sophisticated or possible to

716
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,440
those potential targets so my first plea

717
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,020
to you would be give those targets extra

718
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,910
attention and do it with a little bit of

719
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,340
nuance and a little bit of context the

720
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,960
win there is that if you're

721
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,550
communicating in a way that those target

722
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,020
populations and the people working with

723
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,480
them can understand that information is

724
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,800
at least going to be useful to people

725
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,330
working with them right you can't

726
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,010
necessarily change their behavior but

727
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,810
you can give them tools to help change

728
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,700
theirs it's remarkable that sometimes

729
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,380
when we give presentations we actually

730
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,540
have to talk about reports that mention

731
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,760
civil society targets but that do almost

732
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,590
no lift in terms of showing that those

733
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,580
targets are at risk so if you've bought

734
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,930
that you're like all right I want to do

735
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,150
something about this how do I do it well

736
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,470
the first thing that you can do is think

737
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,940
about some two-way partnerships with

738
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,620
civil society either directly or

739
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,390
indirectly and this can make a lot of

740
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,330
sense from your perspective civil

741
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,240
society groups are very targeted

742
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,530
therefore there are natural partners for

743
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,360
getting could threat intelligence but

744
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,040
this is where you have to be careful and

745
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,440
you have to ensure that this is a fair

746
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,590
relationship and it has benefits both

747
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,020
ways and to do that you need to build up

748
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,630
trust right and Trust is transactional

749
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,580
and it takes time

750
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,620
and it takes a very long time to build

751
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,420
out and you can lose it overnight so

752
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,580
treat civil society in the same way as

753
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,710
an important client you know or a

754
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,690
sensitive case that you're doing and

755
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,060
make sure you understand what your

756
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,520
strengths are what you can do and what

757
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,500
you can't do what they can do and can't

758
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,570
do and have that be communicated upfront

759
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,780
and build up that relationship all right

760
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,460
obviously volunteering is something that

761
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,750
you can do too we got a lot of people

762
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,040
who get in touch you say hey man I want

763
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,360
to do something for the problem of the

764
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,070
you know the people right I want to help

765
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,670
out so obviously there are opportunities

766
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,620
to engage as individuals and as

767
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,380
organizations those may look different

768
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,120
depending on where you sit and depending

769
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,350
on the kinds of flexibility and

770
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,600
resources that are available to you

771
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,610
maybe it means working with intermediary

772
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,720
groups maybe it means supporting

773
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,150
researchers like us right shameless

774
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,490
promo or others who are working on these

775
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:34,030
cases it may mean looking more towards

776
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,040
volunteering or it could mean providing

777
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,830
direct product support to groups we're

778
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,570
happy to have these conversations with

779
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,160
you if this is the kind of work that

780
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,250
you're interested in doing I think it's

781
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,380
very scary often for people who are

782
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,610
coming from industry to think about how

783
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,380
you can engage and so the question is

784
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,490
like man would there be a lot of

785
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,530
transaction costs what I even know how

786
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,240
to talk with these people who's going to

787
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,620
manage the relationship and the answer

788
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,420
is there are approaches to addressing

789
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,800
those things you just may not be

790
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,380
familiar with them with that we want to

791
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,540
pivot to questions the one thing I will

792
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,490
flag though is citizen lab work is

793
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,320
massively collaborative we have a great

794
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,270
team of people inside the lab who do

795
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,980
good work and then we have tons of

796
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,900
people in industry and elsewhere who

797
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,250
support and help us in our

798
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,450
investigations whether that means

799
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,240
providing free or discounted product or

800
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,850
tossing across threat Intel so with that

801
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,919
let's pivot to questions unfortunately
