<font color="#CCCCCC">I weird virus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bulletin conference in</font>

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,580
Vancouver my guest is Costin RAIU from

<font color="#E5E5E5">kaspersky lab global research and</font>

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,849
analysis team we just about halfway

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,610
through the first day of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conference</font>

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,830
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an interesting keynote from</font>

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,050
the security guy at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook and some</font>

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,580
other smaller talks can you give me a

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,189
sense of what are some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font>

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,049
that stood out for you today yeah it's

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">already pretty interesting conference I</font>

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,000
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for me the 12 conference</font>

13
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:33,570
so I've been to quite a few of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those and</font>

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,180
definitely this year<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's gravitating</font>

15
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,879
around Stuxnet I think that's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,579
be the most interesting thing there is

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,199
going to be a presentation from Symantec

18
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,289
they're going to talk about their

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,210
analysis of Stuxnet and then we'll have

20
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">a joint presentation together with</font>

21
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,640
Microsoft about our<font color="#CCCCCC"> own research into</font>

22
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,709
stocks net but definitely that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all</font>

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,660
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see adverse both in</font>

24
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,980
there's a few other very interesting

25
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,809
presentations like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one you're</font>

26
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,599
mentioning from link below<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gorski at</font>

27
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,640
Facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how important social</font>

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,880
social networks have become and how

29
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,090
social networks are moving towards in

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,970
the direction of authentication and how

31
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,759
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to replace other means in</font>

32
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,789
the future did you get a sense from from

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,790
that keynote that Facebook is really

34
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,830
taking security seriously and they're on

35
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,310
top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things or do you find them it's</font>

36
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,780
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook being reacting to some of</font>

37
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,600
the issues they've been facing rather

38
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,329
than being proactive to ward off attacks

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,309
a very good question well but for me

40
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,529
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second Facebook</font>

41
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">security-related</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation and I have</font>

42
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,270
seen so far I've seen another one also

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">very good presentation from mexicali</font>

44
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">with which is a chief security officer</font>

45
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,740
at Facebook and he presented a blackhead

46
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,750
conference and he spoke a bit about that

47
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,460
tribution of attacks which is a very

48
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">very interesting and modern way of</font>

49
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,610
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fight the cyber criminals and</font>

50
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,079
the main idea there was about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact</font>

51
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,119
that you cannot fight the

52
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,848
vulnerabilities there will always be

53
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,220
vulnerabilities in software what you can

54
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:13,350
do is that is go after the attackers and

55
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,780
try to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it count</font>

56
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,600
exam pay for what they're doing today

57
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a more technical presentation I</font>

58
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,700
think and they are showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit about</font>

59
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:26,460
the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> measures they have</font>

60
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,920
integrated into<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook and the fact</font>

61
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,770
that usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best security is a kind</font>

62
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,350
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do not see so there's a lot of</font>

63
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,300
interesting technologies built into

64
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:40,380
facebook which are trying to protect the

65
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:42,090
users then I'll never see yes what still

66
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,490
there there yes and they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we may</font>

67
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,620
worry today that the majority of attacks

68
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,420
that happened on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook just are never</font>

69
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,980
successful because of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of these</font>

70
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,809
technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> room the stuff</font>

71
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,850
that you see is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a small percentage</font>

72
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,380
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff they're dealing with do you</font>

73
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,680
send you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you believe there's a</font>

74
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,630
there's theater do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get a sense that</font>

75
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,540
they're really<font color="#CCCCCC"> on top of things because</font>

76
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,730
we continue to see big outbreaks on

77
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,679
facebook click Jacqui Cooke<font color="#E5E5E5"> face</font>

78
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,660
continues to score<font color="#E5E5E5"> more on facebook or</font>

79
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,870
is it always going to be cat and mouse

80
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,460
as it relates<font color="#CCCCCC"> to facebook oh I think</font>

81
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably we have seen a similar</font>

82
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,810
situation a couple of years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago when we</font>

83
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:21,030
started having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of viruses and</font>

84
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,360
Trojans for windows and we all know that

85
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,370
Microsoft was doing a very poor job with

86
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,980
the patching vulnerabilities and that's

87
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,320
how the<font color="#CCCCCC"> secure initiative was launched</font>

88
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,170
and I think that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite different</font>

89
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,609
this time I do think that Facebook

90
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,350
they're doing a bit better than

91
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,540
Microsoft was doing a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

92
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago so from that point of view I think</font>

93
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,120
the game is a bit different and they are

94
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:49,350
doing a bit better did you get any

95
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,690
representations beyond the yes yes

96
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:54,630
absolutely as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have seen our colleague</font>

all his details are worth about seven

was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting presentation</font>

00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,780
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of buzz here around mobile malware</font>

00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,790
the years<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last it's big</font>

169
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:58,340
big conference is no 20 years old you've

170
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:02,060
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming here for 12 years is this</font>

171
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:04,609
how has it evolved from being just a

172
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,250
traditional conference where it was just

173
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,900
around nailin virus activity to talk

174
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,570
about Stuxnet reaching home to all kinds

175
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,359
of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know scary environments oh to be</font>

176
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:17,540
honest there are not so many changes

177
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">compared to 10 years ago 12 years ago</font>

178
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:23,510
and virus bulletin has this tradition of

179
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:27,380
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> very conservative so they don't</font>

180
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:29,270
easily change things yeah but at the

181
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,390
same time we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep in mind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

182
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:35,780
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most successful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> antivirus</font>

183
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:39,200
conference in in the industry so that

184
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:41,989
means that when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to going to the</font>

185
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,849
anti-malware conference people go to

186
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:47,180
virus bulletin and they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been going</font>

187
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:49,040
to virus bulletin for 20 years now and

188
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">as I was saying it didn't change much</font>

189
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:56,510
but there have been some really really

190
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:59,120
important motive such as the tour Botox

191
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:03,320
they had been introduced about two years

192
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,450
ago and they do allow the conference to

193
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,909
keep up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the novelties in the field</font>

194
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:10,099
so that's why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have presentations</font>

195
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:14,330
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stuxnet which was revealed in</font>

196
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:16,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">July 2010 and also we have other allows</font>

197
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,310
minute presentations about really hot

198
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:23,179
subjects and to be a hot subjects<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

199
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:28,570
well that's one of the mandatory factors

200
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:28,570
when the jury was evaluating the paper
