1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,000
all right uh we're ready for the finals

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,700
sort of talk of this particular segment

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,080
before the break

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,840
um so we've got one more uh remote

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,660
presentation for you guys

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,980
um if you guys have just settled down

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,279
then we can start that

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,980
hello my name is Patricia musumba and

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,779
I'm really excited to be here even

10
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:22,980
virtually

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,960
I am a digital security Associated

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,060
co-creation Hub which is one of the

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,160
biggest pan-african Innovation hubs here

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,220
in Africa I covered this paper with Tim

15
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,559
dagori who leads the technology and

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,880
Society team

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,700
as the technology and Society Tim we

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,399
explore the opportunities and threats of

19
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,920
Technology on the African ecosystem and

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,079
curate programs that address their

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,200
identified needs today I'm happy to be

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,719
presenting to you the long arm of the

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,780
prisoner social engineering from Kenyan

24
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,320
prisons

25
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,000
I will Begin by giving you some of the

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,520
background on the recent uptick in

27
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,099
attacks then we'll briefly introduce

28
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,340
social engineering as a talk is a tactic

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,100
or technique and then we will Deep dive

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,020
into some of the techniques used by

31
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,260
prisoners to defraud uh Kenyans and

32
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,960
lastly we'll look at some mitigation

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,600
strategies so let's get started

34
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,439
uh so recent reports show that nearly

35
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,140
half of Kenyans using mobile money have

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,600
been deforded one way or another

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,540
this could be things comes or attacks

38
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,180
specific attacks such as swim swap

39
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,900
for context Kenya has about 68 million

40
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,020
registered mobile money accounts so to

41
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,360
have nearly 50 percent having been

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,320
defaulted it is honestly quite scary

43
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,060
so recently there has been an increase

44
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,340
in the cases of scams that are reported

45
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,280
on with a recent major news report

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,340
exposing a call center in committee

47
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,700
maximum prison because of such reports

48
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,439
here in Kenya We Now call scammers

49
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,060
committee boys

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,280
uh you would think you know physical

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,700
confinement would deter business from

52
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,760
perpetrating more attacks but just as

53
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,040
technology has revolutionized the way we

54
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,020
interact the way we learn the way we

55
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,099
communicate and even the way we transact

56
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:28,080
but it has also extended the criminals

57
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,520
playground

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,280
so for prisoners they can acquire some

59
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,220
digital Freedom through smuggled mobile

60
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,640
devices

61
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,040
is and through that found digital

62
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,319
Freedom they can do unsuspects in

63
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,340
Kenyans

64
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,060
but how exactly do they do it

65
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,459
so this is where social engineering

66
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:51,900
comes to play

67
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,940
I know most of us here already familiar

68
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,819
with social engineering but I'll briefly

69
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,400
talk about about it and then proceed to

70
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,920
look at specific context that are used

71
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,080
by prisoners

72
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,959
so you're not in the security field if

73
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,000
you haven't heard of the famous people

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,620
are the weakest link in the security

75
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,640
chain while this this actually becomes

76
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,220
true because we tend to lean more

77
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,260
towards the benefit of adult and

78
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,599
trusting other people other than being

79
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,060
skeptical and that is what mostly

80
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,860
attackers prey on

81
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,840
uh social engineering involves

82
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,360
psychological manipulation to trick

83
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,180
users into making security mistakes or

84
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,400
giving away sensitive information

85
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,440
this information is then used in very

86
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,500
malicious ways for prisoners however

87
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,060
they are only looking for money they're

88
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,280
looking for a quick payday

89
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,440
so while most social engineering

90
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,659
techniques will differ in terms of

91
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:53,400
execution most of them follow footsteps

92
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,700
so the first step an attacker will begin

93
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,560
with research to gather information

94
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,620
about a Target so this information is

95
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,200
then used in the next phase uh where an

96
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,299
attacker initiates contacts with the

97
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,120
victim uh to develop a relationship with

98
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,019
them

99
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,420
so having extensive details on the

100
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,000
target mostly usually encourages trust

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,940
which makes it again very easy to forge

102
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,500
a relationship

103
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,779
so once the victim is hooked they're

104
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,259
then more likely to be emotionally

105
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:26,880
influenced and so that is when the

106
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,680
attacker proceeds to exploit the

107
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,940
relationship

108
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,060
in the play Phase the attacker then

109
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,280
solicits favors or asks for sensitive

110
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,880
information such as mobile money pins

111
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,540
then lastly in that last phase the

112
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,300
attacker detaches from the victim and in

113
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,400
most cases they want to leave little to

114
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,840
no proof

115
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,600
so for prisoners not all techniques are

116
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,479
feasible for obvious reasons for example

117
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,520
physical techniques such as you know

118
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,979
shoulder surfing dumpster diving and

119
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,800
tailgating are relevant so in this

120
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,300
section we'll look at some of the

121
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,600
techniques uh Kenyans have been duped

122
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,540
using and then into sending with big

123
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,940
amounts of money to prisoners

124
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,840
so first we have fishing and fishing is

125
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,000
a type of social engineering attack that

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,100
is frequently used to you know steal

127
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,919
user information and for example credit

128
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,440
card information mobile money pins or

129
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,240
even login credentials that is your

130
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,259
password

131
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:29,639
and then

132
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,340
um mostly the attacker will masquerade

133
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,220
as a trusted entity and trick the victim

134
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,500
into opening an email or even a text

135
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,699
messages

136
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,740
but fishing can also happen through

137
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,320
calls and in this case it will be known

138
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,280
as it will be known as wishing so

139
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,680
wishing is a contracted form

140
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,620
um so that is voice phishing so it

141
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,039
becomes wishing uh but mostly prisoners

142
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,240
will rely on text messages and

143
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,000
and calls where they send messages or

144
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,580
make calls to random numbers just hoping

145
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,919
to catch their next victim

146
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,199
so according to news reports there are

147
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,180
specific feature phones that prisoners

148
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,060
use for this particular technique so for

149
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,380
example their itel model 5170 it usually

150
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,020
comes enabled with a voice altering

151
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,240
feature which is popularly actually

152
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,759
known as the magic voice which allows

153
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,199
you know an attacker to switch their

154
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,300
voice from a man's to a woman's or even

155
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,620
to a child

156
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,560
uh so this inbuilt voices most of the

157
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,180
times they're usually foreign so it

158
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,360
could be American or or european and

159
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,639
this allows prisoners to run scams based

160
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,979
on a foreigner pretext so we'll talk

161
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,440
about pre-texting next

162
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,259
uh so mostly pretexting involves the

163
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,139
creation of very fictitious and very

164
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,960
very convincing scenarios mainly to

165
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,600
still a you know a victim's personal

166
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,639
information

167
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,860
so the attack is carried out through

168
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,759
phone calls emails or messages

169
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,340
and most of the time these stories they

170
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,240
are

171
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,880
created in a way to encourage the victim

172
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,400
to you know believe and trust the

173
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,539
attacker

174
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,000
so one of the most common scenarios used

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,539
in used is the radio station cash price

176
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:22,919
pretext

177
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,340
just to give you a bit of context Kenya

178
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,860
has over 100 radio stations and all

179
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,319
these radio stations are competing for

180
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,060
the same audience

181
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,479
and so a lot of times they will use

182
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:37,979
competitions and they will use draws and

183
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,740
games to attract

184
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,199
to attract and maintain their audience

185
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,419
and of course prisoners also know this

186
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:48,740
and so they can also use that particular

187
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,780
competition to their advantage

188
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,780
so they will contact a victim and inform

189
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,060
them that they have won a prize with a

190
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,000
local radio station but then here comes

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,759
the clutch they will need the victim to

192
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,699
send money to redeem the cash prize or

193
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,039
even to facilitate their transfer of

194
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,840
that particular price that the victim

195
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,860
won

196
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,220
and a lot of times this pretext targets

197
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,680
rural inhabitants with knowledge of

198
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,139
digital safety may be a bit lacking

199
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,680
so in one news report by Citizen TV

200
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,020
there's a prisoner who actually admitted

201
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,259
uh to running this particular pretext on

202
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:33,599
house girls and gate men again prying on

203
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,559
um I don't want to say ignorance but

204
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,260
the lack of knowledge

205
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,419
so maybe they've not been trained on

206
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,820
they have they're not aware of these

207
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,339
scams and so they're more likely to fall

208
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:51,839
prey uh to this particular pretext

209
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,540
so another pretext that really works is

210
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,480
the promise of greener pastures so

211
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,000
victims will most likely be promised

212
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,399
employment or even travel opportunities

213
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,800
and then they will be asked to provide

214
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,339
documents to organize the logistics for

215
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,120
this particular case and in this case

216
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,700
this is usually a very long corn kind of

217
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,060
pretext where it has to be you know a

218
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,720
series of communications and in those in

219
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,000
those Communications the attacker then

220
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,880
here the prisoner will even send flight

221
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,100
details they'll send employment letters

222
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,140
they'll even send entry letters or

223
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,300
invite letters into the country the

224
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,740
victim had selected and then finally The

225
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,839
Prisoner will actually ask

226
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,680
um

227
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,220
they will ask the victim to send to pay

228
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,860
a certain amount in taxes that are

229
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,860
required by the destination country

230
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,860
there's actually one news report

231
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,959
um where there's a source who claimed to

232
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,540
have used this particular pretext on

233
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,320
somalis who wish to come to Kenya so we

234
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,760
all know that Somalia has been

235
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,339
experiencing some political instability

236
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,980
and of course attackers or prisoners can

237
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,580
prey on this on the victim's desire to

238
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,959
escape to more stable environments

239
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,140
so another pretext that is known to Hook

240
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,480
victims is the stranded Foreigner

241
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,620
scenario

242
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,140
so I analyzed some of

243
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,519
um some comments on Facebook shared by a

244
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,620
lot of women actually

245
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,600
um about scams that they have

246
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,899
experienced before and this was one of

247
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,740
the most mentioned type of scum and it

248
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,200
mainly targets women

249
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,920
um because the attacker then tries to

250
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,320
create you know a romantic relationship

251
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,320
so in this case the attacker will fake

252
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,800
an accent or even use their magic voice

253
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,860
feature that we talked about and to do

254
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,720
that they will then create a foreign

255
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,300
identity they will then attempt to

256
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,779
create a romantic relationship over time

257
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:08,100
while pretending you know to be an

258
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,140
expatriate who has been posted to a

259
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,760
different side of town

260
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,240
and once the target is hooked the the

261
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,860
attacker will most likely arrange for a

262
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,640
meeting in the target's choice of in the

263
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,579
target's town and they will even share

264
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:26,160
Hotel details or whether of where they

265
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,920
will be staying however

266
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,260
in the course of this fictitious Journey

267
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,420
they will pretend to be stranded for

268
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,880
example at a filling station and they

269
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,100
will claim to have no

270
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,160
Kenyan currency to actually pay for

271
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,680
their pay for the services at The

272
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,240
Filling Station

273
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,560
and then

274
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,899
um sometimes even the victim will have a

275
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,480
conversation with the attendant at the

276
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,300
at the filling station and of course

277
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,000
they will request the victim to save the

278
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,720
day

279
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,899
and most victims will send money you

280
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,120
know it's a long coin they've been in

281
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,279
communication with this person so they

282
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,260
trust them they know they're coming they

283
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,720
win then probably even shared photos of

284
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,480
gifts they're bringing them and you know

285
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,899
they're excited finally meet this person

286
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:16,800
and so

287
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,779
most of these victims will send money

288
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,420
and be the heroes of the day then only

289
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,339
to be ghosted after the transaction has

290
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,560
been completed you know you call that

291
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,260
number and you told nope

292
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,300
um this number is no longer in service

293
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,360
but you've already sent uh send money to

294
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,459
this person you're expecting them to be

295
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,740
coming maybe you're even ready for these

296
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,320
dates that that you're having with this

297
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,640
person

298
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,100
so the screenshot you actually see on

299
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,779
your screen is an actual message I

300
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,940
received on my phone and there are

301
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,800
actually a dozen others like it it's

302
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,060
just that I could only have one

303
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,860
screenshot on the slides

304
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,120
and so

305
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,860
um that is one of the pretexts that

306
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,200
actually really works and mainly on

307
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,399
women

308
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,760
and then lastly as you know all social

309
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,420
Engineers know uh basing phishing

310
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,240
pretext on current events almost always

311
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,500
pays off

312
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,019
and you know prisoners know this as well

313
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,720
so we are hoping maybe someday they will

314
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,540
transition to White hearts and be the

315
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,700
good guys because to be honest they do

316
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,519
have some good skills and that no one

317
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,040
has taught them this so uh with some

318
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,500
Landing they could be the good guys

319
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,200
So based on what's happening in the

320
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,360
country committee boys will try to

321
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,380
emulate that in their fake scenarios

322
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,820
on the right of the screen is a message

323
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,360
I received during the onset of Corona

324
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,899
and it translates uh to hi Mom the

325
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,700
school was closed today morning because

326
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,240
of coronavirus please send bus fare to

327
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,560
teacher David

328
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,860
God forbid your and your parents and you

329
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,320
actually know a teacher David that your

330
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,839
daughters or your son's school you

331
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,060
actually may well be convinced of this

332
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,500
particular scum especially based on the

333
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:12,019
anxiety of that Corona pandemic period

334
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,240
thank you

335
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,380
so the next

336
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,139
um the last technique actually that we

337
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,240
will we'll talk about is quid pro quo

338
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,339
the good old you know scratch my back I

339
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,980
scratch yours and in this case the

340
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,019
attacker asks the victim to divulge

341
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:28,880
information

342
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,920
or to perform an action and they'll be

343
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,740
worded with something so for prisoners

344
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,320
this mainly happens with mobile money

345
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,800
platforms for example the attacker

346
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,480
Center fabricated mobile message

347
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,339
claiming to have sent money to the wrong

348
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,120
recipients and request the victim to

349
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,339
send the money back and receive a small

350
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,399
cut from the amount so they will send a

351
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,040
fake let's say m-pesa message in this

352
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,000
case

353
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,760
so another example is when they promise

354
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,399
to arrange employment for the victim but

355
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,260
then they will ask for some form of

356
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,899
payments once the victim receives their

357
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,160
offer letter

358
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,779
so this is actually something that

359
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:13,500
happened to Dr Selena ambe who lost

360
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,100
about 800 000 Kenya Shillings which is

361
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,380
roughly about 7

362
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,760
000 U.S US dollars in 2020.

363
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,880
so a prisoner by the name of you know

364
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,420
Patrick shikuri amere who is actually

365
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,079
having a life sentence at committee

366
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:36,480
at committee maximum prison promised Dr

367
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,120
Amber position as the State House human

368
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,000
resources manager and this was done

369
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,040
through a series of communications and

370
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,699
phone calls and Facebook messages

371
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:49,860
and Dr Amber even received an executive

372
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,920
number order number one from the

373
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,160
president confirming her appointment as

374
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,019
the human resources manager at state

375
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:01,500
house it was obviously forged but you

376
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,600
know very very well executed that she

377
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,480
actually believed it and then she

378
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,579
proceeded to set the

379
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:11,399
the 800 000 is a way of you know you

380
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,779
facilitated this for me so here is my

381
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,399
um he's my

382
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,399
thank you or you know he is there is

383
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,459
your cat for organizing this job for me

384
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:26,160
that case was actually tried

385
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,820
um in 20 uh 20 earlier this year it was

386
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,339
tried in court and

387
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,100
um I do remember that the judge

388
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,480
mentioned that he did not seem

389
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,459
remorseful really because again he's

390
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,820
already in prison serving a sentence and

391
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,259
so some of these things that we've

392
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,420
talked about here have been criminalized

393
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,220
by

394
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,180
um their computer misuse and cyber

395
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,800
Crimes Act of 2018 here in Kenya but

396
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,259
then you see already prisoners already

397
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,820
in prison so they've already been

398
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,119
incarcerated and so for them those Hefty

399
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:11,099
fines or those uh the fines and the and

400
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,500
the prison times that accompany some of

401
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,740
these offenses really do not deter them

402
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,020
are from perpetrating some of these

403
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,520
attacks

404
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,520
so what can really be done to reduce

405
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,880
this growing Menace

406
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,679
so um for me I am a security trainer and

407
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,240
of course I would like to wait a bit

408
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,640
just how important

409
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,480
um

410
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,960
just how important training is but not

411
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,240
just any training training that is very

412
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,240
localized because as we've seen in this

413
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,419
uh particular presentation we've seen

414
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,880
that some of this scums usually targets

415
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,480
uh people in rural areas where security

416
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,160
awareness trading is actually very

417
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,460
dismal and a lot of security awareness

418
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,700
trading here in Kenya is done by

419
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,640
corporates who are mainly in in

420
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,960
financial services so banking banking

421
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,880
institutions will do a lot of security

422
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,000
awareness and then we'll also have some

423
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,860
telecommunication companies for example

424
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,179
we have safaricom who also do a lot of

425
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:23,520
awareness through their platforms but a

426
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,380
lot of this training is usually done in

427
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,559
English and in Swahili which may not be

428
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,940
very relatable to a lot of people

429
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,799
um a lot of people in Kenya especially

430
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,280
those in rural areas and so

431
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,620
inclusion Swahili may not be as

432
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,840
relatable as you know vernacular

433
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,039
languages in rural areas and so content

434
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,980
in different vernacular languages can be

435
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,260
actually very effective and enhance

436
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,980
knowledge retention and these training

437
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,480
campaigns can actually be run through

438
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,179
the same radio stations that uh you know

439
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,580
that have all these cash prizes and that

440
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,720
have a lot of listeners on a daily basis

441
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,520
and through

442
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,620
through the radio stations and even

443
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,740
through bulk text messages we could

444
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,900
reach a lot of Kenyans including those

445
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,940
who are using uh feature phones

446
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,679
and then next we have

447
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:25,020
um we need improved infrastructure of

448
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,559
course to prepare and to detect and to

449
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,340
respond uh to the ever-changing uh

450
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,580
digital security threats and so some of

451
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,360
the things that the government has done

452
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,280
recently the government of Kenya

453
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,980
actually launched the Nationals forensic

454
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,919
club and during the launch the president

455
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,640
actually reiterated just how improved

456
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,059
infrastructure would go a long way in

457
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,360
copying the new wave of digital attacks

458
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,039
um and he was he was actually

459
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,480
specifically referring to steam swapping

460
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,700
and the famous committee boys you know

461
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,760
sent this number and all these ass comes

462
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,160
that we've discussed in this particular

463
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,220
presentation and then lastly of course

464
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,460
let's cut them off at the source we do

465
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,220
need improved Security in

466
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,039
um in prisons this is to make sure that

467
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,179
we have

468
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,080
less and less ways of smuggling in

469
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,820
technology that I list by depriving them

470
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,700
of devices and mobile devices that they

471
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,200
can use to communicate to the outside

472
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,640
world then it's it greatly reduces the

473
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,580
number of scums that are going are

474
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,679
emanating from prisons

475
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,580
and so since the the news reports the

476
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,140
Kenya prison service has actually

477
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,059
announced that you know more security

478
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:57,600
measures such as cctvs and metal

479
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,780
detectors actually being implemented in

480
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,860
Kenyan in Kenyan prisons and so that's

481
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,039
that actually also shows the need for

482
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:11,520
reporting uh the need for

483
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,400
sharing our experiences when we you know

484
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,340
fall prey to these attacks when we when

485
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,460
we fall prey to these um scums because

486
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,660
again when we when we share as common

487
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,320
when I uh or citizens that is the

488
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,260
Swahili word for citizen in Kenya and

489
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,780
when we do share then it warrants

490
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,419
attention onto these emerging threats

491
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:39,480
and it's uh with such attention then

492
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,740
more measures can be implemented more

493
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,900
more policies can be implemented as well

494
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,480
so by sharing by reporting by

495
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,659
encouraging people to speak about these

496
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,179
comes then it enables us to push the

497
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:58,500
conversation forward and one of

498
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,260
as a Security Professionals can actually

499
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,200
be very key to this particular

500
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,039
um to this particular quest to reduce

501
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,679
mobile money and digital and digital

502
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,820
scams because for us what may be very

503
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,460
you know common knowledge and familiar

504
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,039
may not be so to a lot of other people

505
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,100
and so it's also our duty as Security

506
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,580
Professionals to put ourselves out there

507
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,000
and to actually speak more about

508
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,220
um about these attacks and about things

509
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,799
that can be done it's um it's on Monday

510
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,820
to actually share and to teach others

511
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,400
about the knowledge that we do have and

512
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,919
while doing that we should remember to

513
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,320
break it down to

514
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,200
um nuggets that non-technical audiences

515
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,059
can actually process

516
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,580
and so with that I have come to the end

517
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,520
of my presentation uh thank you so much

518
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,340
for listening in

519
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:04,158
I will now take any questions

520
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,840
thank you Patricia and thank you for

521
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,539
joining us live for the Q a session a

522
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:17,340
very intruding talk have you got any

523
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,260
questions from the audience

524
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,720
yeah thanks very much for a really good

525
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,799
talk

526
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,020
um so rather than

527
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,900
um using CCTV and trying to catch the

528
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,000
criminals who are in prisons and using

529
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,179
banned devices is it not an option to

530
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,460
have some form of Faraday cage around

531
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,340
the prison itself so that any signals to

532
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,840
such devices just wouldn't work

533
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,880
uh thank you so much for that question

534
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,640
and uh thank you so for listening in

535
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,700
um I'm joining you from Lusaka here in

536
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,340
Zambia I'm attending another conference

537
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,940
on internet freedom in Africa and um to

538
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,039
answer your question

539
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:06,260
um for us is also that bit of

540
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,840
funding in terms of having

541
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,179
um such

542
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:15,360
Technologies in our presence to have uh

543
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,539
to disrupt signals and all that because

544
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:21,120
there's also that question of

545
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,700
um how do we make sure that the

546
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,980
disruption of signals around prisons

547
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,860
doesn't also affect

548
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,799
those working in prisoners to ensure

549
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,960
um that the prisons are running well but

550
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,640
it is something I think that is being

551
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,640
explored uh by the prison's Department

552
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,679
because when these reports came out

553
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,679
there was a lot of push from the general

554
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,940
public as well from media to improve

555
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,240
um security as and that might be cctv's

556
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,220
for us that might be the next step and

557
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,360
also having metal detectors and better

558
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,260
improved such and

559
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,799
security around visitation so that we

560
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,559
can reduce that the number of smuggled

561
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,960
in devices but that is a really really

562
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,140
good suggestion and it is something that

563
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,600
um they mentioned during some of the

564
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,780
briefings that were held after after the

565
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,900
news reports in April that they will

566
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,760
they will be exploring more ways of

567
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,400
making sure that uh prisoners do not

568
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,860
have access to the internet

569
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,140
um but they still had access they have

570
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,380
access to entertainment but not access

571
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,240
to the internet where they can actually

572
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,000
be on Facebook and on Twitter and they

573
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,740
can be in communication with the outside

574
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,440
world so yes thank you so much for that

575
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,720
uh suggestion as well

576
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,520
any more questions

577
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,140
one over here

578
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,500
or a Fabio first uh hi for your

579
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,620
presentation very interesting I want to

580
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,340
ask you about Sin swap attacks you said

581
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,740
in your presentation I want to know if

582
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,580
he had a problem in Africa uh especially

583
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,580
in Kenya I was covering this topic in

584
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,240
the past and uh we saw some group of

585
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,260
criminals using malware to infect the

586
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,640
network of uh Telecom operators aiming

587
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,100
to do a remote access to perform this in

588
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,799
swap if this is the case in your country

589
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,260
or if they are using only social

590
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,840
engineering or fake documents to perform

591
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,740
the scene swap

592
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,279
foreign

593
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,279
attack

594
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,460
um in Kenya especially and

595
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,880
um we have actually gotten reports of

596
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,000
um Telecom employees employee employees

597
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,320
will work in the Telecommunications

598
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,620
industry actually being in kahoots with

599
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,020
uh some of these criminals as well to

600
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,140
perpetrate those attacks so there is

601
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,539
social engineering as well uh but

602
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,779
there's also that Insider Insider

603
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:05,100
threats

604
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,940
um aspect of having operators or so

605
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,659
being in cahoots with criminals to

606
00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:14,580
perpetrix sim Swap and it is something

607
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,580
that a lot of there was a lot of

608
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,500
campaigns against Sim swap so that

609
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,020
people were aware that this is something

610
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,200
that happens so that if you see your

611
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,820
um if you see your network completely

612
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,100
just go off all of a sudden that you can

613
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,740
report very quickly and to make sure

614
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,020
that you do not maybe lose money through

615
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,179
mobile mobile oil money which is

616
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,039
something that we use a lot here in

617
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:40,679
Kenya so yes it is something that

618
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:43,799
happens a lot but there has been a

619
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,900
significant decrease especially after

620
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,539
all those campaigns that were done

621
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:52,380
um especially I think in 2017 to from

622
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,360
around 2017 there was a lot of those

623
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,059
cases being reported but there have been

624
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:59,779
various interventions as well as

625
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:02,279
interventions both on the public side

626
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,159
and even from the private sector in the

627
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:08,279
Telecommunications industry

628
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,260
I think we've got time for one more

629
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,340
question so darling

630
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:16,919
thank you uh thank you for the

631
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:19,159
presentation

632
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,840
um you mentioned the case where the

633
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,120
attacker was serving a life sentence in

634
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,279
prison so I'm wondering what's the

635
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,919
motivation to earn money this way or if

636
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:31,919
you have any stories in about how they

637
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,380
can then access and use the funds

638
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,840
if they're in prison for the remainder

639
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,379
of their lives

640
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,140
uh thank you for that question

641
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,940
um the presenting question actually

642
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,760
shared that he would send the money back

643
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,159
home uh because just because their

644
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,600
prisoners doesn't mean they don't have

645
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,940
families and they still want to support

646
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,080
them

647
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,779
um and so a lot of this money is usually

648
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,340
sent to

649
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,679
uh send to families back home in a way

650
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,380
of supporting them and uh in this

651
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,000
particular case

652
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
um he was sentenced to three years in

653
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,940
prison but then that was not the that

654
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,320
really doesn't make any sense because

655
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,600
he's already serving a three-year prison

656
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,159
sentence

657
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:21,360
um but the ruling itself was to deter

658
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,880
those who are not in prison but are also

659
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,880
still perpetrating these attacks uh to

660
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,460
know that our law provides that

661
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,260
Provisions

662
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,500
um offenses and finds what these crimes

663
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,140
and that you will get sentenced to a

664
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,179
prison sentence you will actually have a

665
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:42,480
prison sentence uh so just because he

666
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,860
was incarcerated but

667
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,159
just to make sure that uh criminals do

668
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,899
know that should you be caught you'll

669
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:55,860
actually feel uh this is the law as

670
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,659
um their computer misuse and cyber

671
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:01,860
Crimes Act uh was enacted in 2018 and we

672
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,840
have seen a lot of

673
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,659
push towards the implementation of that
