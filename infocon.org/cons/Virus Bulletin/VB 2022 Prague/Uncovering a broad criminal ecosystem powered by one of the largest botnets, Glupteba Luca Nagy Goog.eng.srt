1
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,139
so hi everyone

2
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:12,599
so in the next 30 minutes I will walk

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,940
you through on how we uncovered abroad

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,000
criminal ecosystem which is behind one

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,300
of the largest water which is named

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,779
so my name is and I'm working for Google

7
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,699
as a security engineer

8
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,920
I'm working in trick in the Trek

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,800
analysis group and I'm working in the

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,640
crime team where we are focusing on

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,719
understanding and disrupting Financial

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,640
motivated threats which are against

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,579
Google and Google users

14
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,000
uh I just would like to note that Google

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,520
disrupted guptaba in 2021 December and

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,440
this talk is not really focusing on the

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,899
disruption itself but rather the

18
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,100
findings and attribution which led us to

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,899
disrupt the botnet and led us to file a

20
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,359
lawsuit against the actors

21
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,939
so what I will talk about it's actually

22
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,340
the October which is a Trojan a modular

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,119
Trojan I will cover the distribution of

24
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,000
the capabilities and the modules of it

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,659
then I will talk about the actors behind

26
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,900
who's operating luctable and then I will

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,240
talk about these Services which they

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,299
provide like awm proxy troughspin and

29
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,920
download form

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,979
and at the end of the presentation I you

31
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,500
should have an overview on how this

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,740
ecosystem is formed by grouptable the

33
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,820
actors and the services

34
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,360
2011 and it's distributed through data

35
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,340
install networks and traffic distributor

36
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,560
services

37
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,020
um so generally a user visits websites

38
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,840
for to download a cracked software for

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,000
instance and it ends up downloading

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,399
looked over but we have seen many other

41
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,520
landing pages like a fake YouTube video

42
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,360
downloader or even like in a pop-ups

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,940
download button or like click here

44
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,360
button or even we have seen Google Docs

45
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,900
which has a URL and lead to download and

46
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,420
supposedly a software but instead it

47
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,160
downloaded Loop taba

48
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,680
and before the disruption we estimated

49
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,739
around 1 million Bots for the desktop

50
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,660
variants

51
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,680
rooftop is also a root kit it has its

52
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,480
dropping kernel drivers so it's for

53
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,180
instance it dropped vinman kernel driver

54
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,379
in order to unlink all the associated

55
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,019
processes from the e-process list for

56
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,879
hiding them so

57
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,580
it also dropped in winmon Alpha kernel

58
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,420
driver

59
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,300
for hiding its objects like the folders

60
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,920
or its binaries from file operations by

61
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,300
registering the fs filter callback

62
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,739
function

63
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,599
uh and it's also dropping minimum

64
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,019
process monitor for uh monitoring and

65
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,440
terminating more than 1000 process we

66
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,959
these are actually like antivirus

67
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,180
related processes

68
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,819
a glutaba is also a backdoor it has wide

69
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:22,080
range of functions uh for installing

70
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,739
updating verifying even hiding their

71
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,420
processes or even taking screenshots or

72
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,920
requesting the configuration of files or

73
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,940
setting the configuration files

74
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,819
is also very well known that it's using

75
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,060
blockchain technology for uh for its as

76
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,700
a backup mechanism for updating their C2

77
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,780
servers

78
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,260
so and the group table binaries has

79
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,879
embedded

80
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,599
um Bitcoin addresses and there are a yes

81
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,420
keys in it and it's checking whether

82
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,239
there is a transaction sent from that to

83
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,700
others and whether there is an OP return

84
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,599
field this opportunity is actually an OP

85
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,060
code for that scripting language which

86
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,239
the transactions are using and it's uh

87
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,420
it just Mark a transaction is an

88
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,060
unsustainable output but it can be

89
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,238
leveraged for storing arbitrary data so

90
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,000
Dr is leveraging it because it's stored

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,080
its C2 server domain name and it's aesgc

92
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,300
almost encrypted so the first

93
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,780
12 bytes is the initialization vector

94
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,100
and the last 16 the GBC

95
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,280
tag by the middle part is the encrypted

96
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,900
domain name

97
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,620
and how this is monitored it's actually

98
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,380
uh it's there is a GitHub public

99
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,800
repository with full of default electron

100
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,380
servers with IP and or domain and port

101
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,919
numbers and looked up a binary we check

102
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,259
and connect there with the electron

103
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,720
protocol and check that transaction

104
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,020
whether it is a transaction

105
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,759
also it is a hard-coded list of electron

106
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,580
servers so if it GitHub link wouldn't be

107
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,100
available but it also checking if

108
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,979
blockchain.com buy a simple HTTP request

109
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,620
for the wallet

110
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,199
The Dropper also gain persistence so it

111
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,560
using auto run Registries and also using

112
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,840
the schedule task for launching and

113
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,900
updating its application and it's also

114
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,820
spreading on the local network by

115
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,720
eternado exploitations

116
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,639
also using on TV virtual machine

117
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,979
techniques it's really frequently was

118
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:44,580
updated for looking for specific files

119
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,720
and folders

120
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,300
and it's as you have seen in the kernel

121
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,660
Drive of course they really and

122
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,360
investigative 14 to self-defense so they

123
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,120
suppress the security by adding some

124
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,240
Windows Defender exclusions or Fiber

125
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,419
rules for allowing inbound connections

126
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:07,020
and also disabled patch guard DSC this

127
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,139
is also needed for the kernel drivers so

128
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,940
you're dropping some public tools for

129
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,740
for disabled project and DSE like an old

130
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,180
virtualbox Cardinal driver with an

131
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,460
exploit

132
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,039
but all about this why I would say Gupta

133
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,940
buys diverse botnet is because it has

134
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,400
many different modules these are just

135
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,440
the most prevalent ones but there are

136
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,960
much more but the group table focusing a

137
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,479
lot on the proxy components so it has a

138
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,360
it has root or exploiter components for

139
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,740
targeting Netgear and microtic

140
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,139
recruiters and turn them into proxies

141
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,979
also it has Chrome extensions which can

142
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,800
inject not advertisement on websites or

143
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,780
browsers still many browsers still are

144
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,300
modules Chrome fingerprinting module

145
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,819
which just create a hash from the Chrome

146
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,039
and also it checks whether there is

147
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,560
webrtc enabled in.com

148
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,280
and it can drop miners both CPU or GPU

149
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,440
based

150
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,000
depending on which is more efficient on

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,199
that host

152
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,380
and we also found Android

153
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,360
variants of gloved ever which I will

154
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,919
talk about later

155
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,740
but let me just Deep dive into just some

156
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,419
of those modules which better

157
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,180
understanding helped us to associate

158
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,419
them into to some entities

159
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,120
so for instance this is the tunnels

160
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,940
proxy which then downloaded for the

161
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,340
victim machine at the moment it will

162
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,120
start register itself to the server as

163
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,400
an available proxy node and this bot

164
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,440
registration is actually a DNS request

165
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,300
with that specific pattern which is

166
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,020
really specific for glutaba it's based

167
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,919
on guid server a digit and the domain

168
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,400
and that then it will connect to that IP

169
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,120
on the 48 000 and the server responds to

170
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,979
random port number and they will start

171
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,960
connect start to establish the

172
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,160
connection on that uh IP port and from

173
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,440
that point This Server will become a

174
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,759
tunnel so the requester motion will use

175
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,879
this as a tunnel and all the traffic

176
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,180
goes through on the C2 server forwards

177
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,740
to the victim machine and the victim

178
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,860
machine IP will be the IP of that proxy

179
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,700
user actually

180
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,140
um as I mentioned we have found Android

181
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,140
variants and these are actually not as

182
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,339
prevalent as the desktop variants but

183
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:45,600
and these were not these were side

184
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,060
loaded from doj APK downloader site not

185
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,240
from uh Play Store and these were very

186
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,160
similar to the desktop variants so they

187
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,140
have proxy modules and they had ads

188
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,860
module which I talk now I will talk now

189
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,660
because these s modules were just

190
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,880
displaying

191
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,440
disruptive advertisement disruptive

192
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,800
advertisements mean they they did it in

193
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,120
an unexpected way so in this case they

194
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,680
hide the closing button so it was

195
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,959
bothering and

196
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,440
they sent a request to the server with

197
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,399
many information from the user and this

198
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,880
the server responds with the URL and

199
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,399
with that Json which you can see and

200
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,160
that's the trustbin.com domain contains

201
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,820
the uh advertisements which will will be

202
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,760
displayed on that application

203
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,459
the browser Stiller module is just one

204
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,279
sentence about it that it's looking the

205
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,200
Chrome profile folder which has the all

206
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,959
the cookies and histories uh it's

207
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,760
capable to deck your password cookies

208
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,220
and it uploads everything to the server

209
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,380
uh and yeah if we check these different

210
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,240
modules we let's raise the questions

211
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,880
because it is a very different in

212
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,339
behavior and like it raised the question

213
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,519
where these are monetized

214
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,980
so we try to find the answers and what

215
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,740
we firstly find out and let us to answer

216
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,560
the question is that we found the threat

217
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,000
actors behind

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,940
and on the left side you can see the

219
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,920
look of a binary some binaries

220
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,440
associated with

221
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,240
on the middle you can see some git

222
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,940
theories which were left in these

223
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,519
binaries and the reason is that these

224
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,200
are virus and in go you can give an

225
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,959
import not only as a relative past but

226
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:46,079
as a full full remote pass and this git

227
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,300
repositories are private git repos

228
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,660
without any reference really there and

229
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,860
these are like from world.com

230
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,680
this was left in a proxy webrtc proxy

231
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,560
module and then there was the module

232
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,060
methods of that binary and this

233
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,040
git.river.com resolved an IP in a period

234
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,040
to the same as gitlam.com

235
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,100
I suspect the gitlab.com is the old kit

236
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,040
servers of them because this let us find

237
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,480
the Android modules and this gitlam.com

238
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,940
was embedded in some really old group

239
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,399
double doctors too but the main point

240
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,680
from this whole figure is rather that

241
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,519
gido's watermark.com led us to find

242
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,519
Voltron which is the developer team of

243
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,880
grouplover and let's check how what the

244
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,880
other services they provide besides

245
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,140
developing jobs about

246
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,100
it's not okay so

247
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,380
actually what we firstly found is that

248
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,160
there were some job description for

249
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,100
voltronberg uh this you can see on the

250
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,240
left upside they

251
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,700
invited Developers for to trustpin.com

252
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,700
this is their website and there was an

253
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,160
email at voltronome.com and the address

254
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,560
so we checked what is dropspin.com

255
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,279
trustpin.com contact page also listed to

256
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,160
registered company behind them Prestige

257
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,620
media lessee and investor so one of them

258
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,019
is a Russian one is on us-based company

259
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,839
and we also could associate this with

260
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:32,040
Voltron

261
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,040
uh and Prestige mediology is a company

262
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,380
which we could associate with many other

263
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,459
services I only listed these three ones

264
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:44,399
which I want to talk about later a

265
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,320
little bit more but there are much more

266
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,019
which if you want you can read on our

267
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,720
complaint but there are others like

268
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,899
payment fraud related Services which

269
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,079
were built on top of these services

270
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,360
um so what are these Services because

271
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,519
it's interesting that there is a proxy

272
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,639
provider there is an advertising network

273
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,779
service

274
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,660
and there's an account service and if

275
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,139
you remember for the different modules

276
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:16,440
this is quite a match because we know

277
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,660
that group type of focusing a lot on the

278
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,720
proxies they have advertising modules

279
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,500
also they have ads module on Android and

280
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,420
this stuff's been advertising network is

281
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,360
they said it's it's exists on Android

282
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,420
platform and they have many browser

283
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,339
Stiller components

284
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,740
and download Farm isn't a conservice

285
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,380
which they say that they provide real

286
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,940
accounts

287
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,220
uh let's Deep dive into some of them

288
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,519
like awm proxy that's a residential

289
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,279
proxy provider which is

290
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,560
has it's one of the biggest one bit is

291
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,320
three more than three hundred thousand

292
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,920
nodes and it's also in the top three web

293
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,560
scraper for Google Search

294
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,560
and how does a proxy provider works like

295
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,399
ewm proxy so if you are a customer of

296
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,920
awm proxy you can have a you will

297
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,100
receive an ip4 number which you have to

298
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,820
set in order to access the proxy node

299
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,100
that will be the proxy Gateway IP and

300
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,639
port and then you will get you will have

301
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,779
an assigned IP address from the ip4

302
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,060
and you can use that IPS and Anonymous

303
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,120
connection and this figure is quite

304
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,279
similar what we have seen as a group

305
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,399
Tower because if you remember the victim

306
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,699
machine will register itself as an

307
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:44,220
available proxy node and from that point

308
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,000
the C2 server will be altana or let's

309
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,800
say proxy Gateway

310
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,500
so the requester motion will redirect

311
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
all the traffic on this C2 server

312
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,260
and this is what we have learned

313
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,820
actually that the IP addresses which awm

314
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,260
provide a list as a proxy Gateway those

315
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,720
IP addresses had a huge overlap with

316
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,180
looped above IP addresses which were

317
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,579
resolved to that both registration

318
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:18,060
pattern if you remember the guid server

319
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,260
and digital domain so yeah it means that

320
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,899
for if that IP is the proxy Gateway is

321
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,980
the C2 server of that proxy module then

322
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,639
probably the proxy pool of the awm proxy

323
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,100
has a victim Machines of grouped above

324
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,100
with installed with these tunnel proxy

325
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,519
module

326
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,920
uh trap swimming is an advertising

327
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,019
Network they said that they they are

328
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,720
real time building advertising Network

329
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,420
it means that they sell and buy

330
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,240
advertisement

331
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,279
based on Impressions Impressions means

332
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,199
like

333
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,000
like some information from the user like

334
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,060
the job location or what website it

335
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,880
visited and this is how it looks like

336
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,180
there is a publisher for instance it's

337
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,420
an owner of an application which make

338
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,579
the decision it will advertise on their

339
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,160
application and there is an app visitor

340
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,320
there will be sent information and

341
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,160
requests to an ad server

342
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,620
based on these informations and the

343
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,720
server forwards a bit request to the

344
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,779
advertisers who all wants to advertise

345
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:34,320
their their content so they will bid for

346
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,420
this request and the app server makes

347
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,880
the decision which advertisement should

348
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,740
be displayed on that in that application

349
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,019
based on those requests

350
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:46,139
and this is what also familiar to us

351
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,800
because in the earth module we have seen

352
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,240
that this is what to build the bat

353
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,240
module does send many information and it

354
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,279
will responds with a URL which which

355
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:01,320
hosts that advertisement and that will

356
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,020
be displayed

357
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,640
and this is actually what we have

358
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,439
learned that they are using totally the

359
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,799
same infrastructure and like the

360
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,740
um we are talking about rough spin

361
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,179
and these ads modules are using

362
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:20,220
click.tropspin.com so actually this

363
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,339
means that we could identify that

364
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,859
draftspeed.com is operated by the same

365
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,919
actors as uh the actors who are

366
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,320
developing glovptable so they are

367
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,679
monetizing through their own services

368
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,900
uh let's check the last one download

369
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,140
Farm we saw they actually they

370
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,419
it's very well documented publicly

371
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,840
because they have a Blog that they had a

372
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,299
Blog they had many customers or forums

373
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,240
that was complained about their services

374
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,940
and what they said from themselves that

375
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,940
they sell real users only

376
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,919
um that's the name is coming from I

377
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,320
guess tool that don't farm that they

378
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,840
don't farmer cons they don't create new

379
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,080
accounts from scratch and start warming

380
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,080
it up or form it and rather they have

381
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,100
somehow real users but they also said

382
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,600
they does this because they want to

383
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,120
support black cat advertisements on

384
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,600
Google ads Twitter or Facebook

385
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,980
because they have some solution for

386
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,360
evading uh being blocked if you want to

387
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,700
advertise something illicit and they

388
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,440
said that they give you a virtual

389
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,860
machine that they settled up browser

390
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,840
with a proxy which points to the same

391
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,520
location as

392
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,360
as the account

393
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,080
so this is how it should look like there

394
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,539
is the customer who wants to access

395
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:55,320
their virtual machines they also told

396
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,380
that they take it can be accessed by RDP

397
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,820
or or on from the browser and they have

398
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,220
this settled up browser with that Chrome

399
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,520
profile folder which has that right

400
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,919
accounts details and they have a proxy

401
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,160
server set up and they can you can use

402
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,460
the customer to access Google ads for

403
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,919
advertising something which should

404
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,660
probably should be blocked

405
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,059
and this is also what we have learned

406
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,340
that the account sold by the indust farm

407
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,059
was

408
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:28,980
stolen by grouptable

409
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,220
so it's again and also we learned that

410
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,460
they are using awm proxy which we also

411
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,799
learned that they are using the loop

412
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,700
table victim machines so it's again just

413
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,940
means that we could identify the actors

414
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,120
who has who are developing guptaba and

415
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,919
they are developing the service where

416
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,240
they are monetizing it

417
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,360
so just let me summarize uh what I was

418
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,799
talking

419
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,539
that there is grouped above it it's

420
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,600
different modules and we could identify

421
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,179
the actors who provide some other

422
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,700
services like awm proxy drop spinal

423
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,660
download from and we have learned that

424
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,360
these services are heavily rely on the

425
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,059
different modules or group taba and

426
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:21,299
these services are used for monetizing

427
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,299
modules

428
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,799
um so as I mentioned that Google

429
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,860
disrupted in last December this botnet

430
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,820
and uh right after we disrupted we have

431
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,000
seen that they started again registering

432
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,100
their domains they started using the

433
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,559
blockchain back up my honey is more so

434
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,020
which I mentioned which was the main

435
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,900
reason why this this group the bubonic

436
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,720
cannot be disrupted technically they

437
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,299
extend some

438
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:56,820
transactions with new domains but we

439
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,220
could react quite as fast so they were

440
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,000
quiet until May and the overall botnet

441
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,660
size decreased uh less than its quarter

442
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,780
from 1 million they also went away from

443
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,940
Google products and we could partially

444
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,820
disrupt it these services

445
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,760
partially because for instance awm proxy

446
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,419
we seen that today I have new domains

447
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:24,020
registered

448
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,160
announced they are closing their

449
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,419
business or even draft spin and since

450
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,940
maybe have didn't see new distribution

451
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,340
but since maybe have seen that they

452
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,559
started relaunching some operations and

453
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:40,740
they started using integral paper is the

454
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,120
network

455
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,179
and the botnet side about that size is

456
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,419
slightly but increasing uh there have

457
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:51,780
new ttps with Bitcoin some new Bitcoin

458
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,780
addresses they are not using EES

459
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,360
encryption for the blockchain but or

460
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,780
simply sore encoded they're using onion

461
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,380
domains as the C2 servers and using

462
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,799
Discord for downloading Tor and they are

463
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,740
dropping it just recently we observed

464
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,039
that they started dropping Opera VPN

465
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:18,799
instead of their own on proxy

466
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,000
so what we have learned from this

467
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,240
year-long investigation is that Gupta

468
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,419
vectors makes mistakes which can be lead

469
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:34,039
us to identify the threat actors

470
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:38,460
uh we also this the technical part of

471
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,580
this investigation gave us an insight

472
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,640
into how diverse the botnet can be

473
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,039
uh but the attribution part that how

474
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,400
divers the usage of a botnet can be and

475
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,100
to leverage a botnet

476
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,659
and we also learned that the group of

477
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:55,860
actors

478
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,440
are running are really complex and

479
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,860
organized ecosystem where they where

480
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,559
they parallel work on developing the

481
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,860
group turbo.net and Pirelli building

482
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,140
around these services

483
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,539
and they have an end-to-end solution for

484
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:16,020
for this monetization and this is kind

485
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,919
of differ from the most I mean other

486
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,860
less sophisticated actors whose are just

487
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,679
for instance in excretory data and pass

488
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,559
it forward or darkness and and don't

489
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,720
really

490
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,480
invest effort to demonetization part and

491
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,380
they just sell and not reuse and use it

492
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,179
and from the disruption we also studied

493
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:44,880
that they carry large their operation

494
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,520
they can change dtps

495
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,100
so this is still an evolving threat

496
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,059
which take continuous monitoring

497
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,440
thank you for your attention

498
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,220
thank you very much I think we have time

499
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,980
for one question maybe if someone has a

500
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,240
question raise your hand the microphone

501
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,840
will come to you

502
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,260
hi Liza

503
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,940
um so you talked a lot about the

504
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,159
advertising Network that was part of

505
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,559
this obviously Google is you know itself

506
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,360
and you know advertising Network and

507
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,799
it's sort of interfering with their

508
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,240
business but

509
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,159
um we didn't see any of the ads that

510
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:30,539
were being delivered through their

511
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:31,740
Network you said that they were

512
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,039
advertising for criminal services or

513
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,960
something or what what were the kinds of

514
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,600
ads that people would see delivered

515
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,580
through the gluteva network and how did

516
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,020
they differ from what you'd see on a

517
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,940
legitimate ad Network

518
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,539
yeah uh actually as I mentioned this ads

519
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:52,320
module was it was not as prevalent and

520
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,240
the S module which we found the Android

521
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,380
variants were from historical data so we

522
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,520
it was from 2018 around and we didn't

523
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,880
really observe what they advertised we

524
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,280
just realized that we just could

525
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,379
associate with the advertising Network

526
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,260
we can I think another question

527
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,780
foreign

528
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,460
first of all uh thank you for your

529
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,559
presentation it was really nice I have a

530
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,400
question

531
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,059
um

532
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,580
do you have any from in do you have any

533
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,580
information on what countries or regions

534
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,059
you found infrastructure for the botnet

535
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,940
sorry I didn't understand uh

536
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,820
do you have any information on the

537
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:45,500
countries or regions in which you found

538
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,620
the budget infrastructure

539
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,240
uh yeah it's

540
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,360
um you can find our complaint and we

541
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,240
Associated the actors involved from work

542
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,120
which is a russian-based company

543
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,179
uh I'm not sure what is in our complaint

544
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:05,580
you can check about the infrastructure

545
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,480
so

546
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,500
I would take it this special or offline

547
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,320
before I check what is our complaint

548
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,918
about it

549
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,100
maybe we'll squeeze in one more question

550
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,939
