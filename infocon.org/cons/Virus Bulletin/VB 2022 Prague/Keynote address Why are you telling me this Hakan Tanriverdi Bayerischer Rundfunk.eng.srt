00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
[Applause]

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,280
hi can you hear me well

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,660
okay

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,780
so first of all thank you for coming and

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,460
before I start with the presentation I

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,680
want to mention two things one

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,660
whenever we were doing a presentation

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,460
investigation in the last couple of

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,439
years at one point I would end up

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,960
watching a conference talk that I was

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,480
giving at virus bulletin so I know

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,640
about the outstanding research that has

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,740
been presented here and that's why it's

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,840
wild to me that I'm on the stage today

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,280
let me to introduce myself briefly

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,680
I work for Public Broadcasting in

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,600
Germany so I work as a reporter as a

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,940
journalist basically like the BBC in the

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,899
UK

20
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,280
and

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,079
the second thing I want to tell before I

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,700
start with the keynote is

23
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,980
that while I'm the one standing on the

24
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,480
stage today nothing that I'm going to

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,520
talk about is just my work it's always

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,100
going to be a bigger investigation it's

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,140
always going to be teamwork so keep that

28
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,379
in the back of your mind the one thing I

29
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,600
describe our team with the one thing we

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,760
have is time so our investigations

31
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,460
usually take around at least three

32
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,220
months but the last two we did close to

33
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,900
a year so we had a story about a group

34
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,220
called snake

35
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,280
and how we were able to tie them just by

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,380
looking at openly available information

37
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,720
to the Russian intelligence agency fsp

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,299
and that took us about close to a year

39
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,060
and another

40
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,439
investigation we had was on a crew

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,600
called our evil so they do ransomware

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,400
and we were able to find out who One

43
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,979
Core member is by finding our personal

44
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,900
Bitcoin address and tying it to the

45
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,240
ransomware operation and that took a

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,439
year as well

47
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,460
and look close to it here so um oh nice

48
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,040
I can I just noticed this I can see what

49
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,240
I'm going to say

50
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,680
um the keynote is titled why are you

51
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,880
telling me this and there are two

52
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,659
reasons for it so whenever I speak with

53
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:59,159
researchers such as yourself or

54
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,899
government officials and they tell me

55
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,060
something that I do find interesting in

56
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,439
the back of my head I will have the

57
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,439
question what's in it for you why are

58
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,239
you telling me this so that's one reason

59
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,940
the second reason is not me asking the

60
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,340
question but you so the audience in

61
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,560
journalism you have a thing called The

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,200
Nut graph and it basically means that

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,879
whenever you read an article in the

64
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,860
fifth paragraph or so there will be a

65
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,340
sentence along the lines of hey

66
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,760
um this hacker group has been secretly

67
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,220
infiltrating the networks of that

68
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,920
government for close to a year and here

69
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,900
is why that's important for you to know

70
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,520
so as a journalist you have to

71
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,200
anticipate your audience because they

72
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,940
are going to ask the question why am I

73
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,280
reading this why am I viewing this why

74
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,019
are you telling me this so let me start

75
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,700
with the second part The journalistic

76
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,800
View on things so when I was asked

77
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,940
whether I would want to give this

78
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,680
keynote I thought to myself hey this is

79
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,140
a very technical conference what can I

80
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,640
even talk about I don't have a

81
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,080
background in information science I

82
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,580
don't do incident response I can't

83
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,920
reverse engineer malware so what else is

84
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,280
there and then I thought about it and

85
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,780
came to understand that whenever there's

86
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,480
a big article in the news media people

87
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,580
within this community will sort of

88
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,400
reverse engineer try to find out how the

89
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,920
reporter knew what the new pick line by

90
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,519
line apart the reporting and guess how

91
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,560
the article got made in the first place

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,780
and that's a problem because journalism

93
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,060
can too many people be a black box if

94
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,739
you're outside looking in if you're not

95
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,060
within media

96
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,640
and since I saw some people on Twitter

97
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,340
and somewhere else discussing the work

98
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,200
that I did I thought to myself it could

99
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,180
be interesting to let you know how

100
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,640
reporters such as myself are able to

101
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,480
find information and where we do this

102
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,360
um and ideally you'll come away from

103
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,200
this talk realizing a how journalists

104
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,120
are listening to what you're saying when

105
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,180
you're talking with them but B also what

106
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,459
you choose not to speak of and you will

107
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,379
be able to use this in one of two ways

108
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,780
one is you'll be better able to protect

109
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,360
yourself against journalists if that is

110
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,519
what you want but you could also use

111
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,019
this information to understand what

112
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,519
journalists are looking for and then

113
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,500
directly reaching out to them because

114
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,420
you have a better understanding of what

115
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,180
is might be interesting to them

116
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,779
so let me get to the first reason the

117
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,300
one in which I think to myself why is

118
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,460
this researcher why is this government

119
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,740
official telling me this I came up with

120
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,600
five reasons mostly because out of time

121
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,820
constraints some of them are obvious

122
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,759
I'll start with one that is not so the

123
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,639
first reason why people tell me

124
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,280
stuff is basically they are not telling

125
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,900
me this

126
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,940
um they're not telling me this in my

127
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,440
function as a journalist and I'll walk

128
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,780
you through it with a example so this is

129
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,139
a document published by clear sky cyber

130
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,060
security it's titled raw threat

131
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,800
intelligence and as you can see it's a

132
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,259
Google doc and every entry starts with

133
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,360
the year and suspicious Lazarus

134
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,139
documents and they find

135
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:06,180
unfinished but interesting things they

136
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,979
were able to find out

137
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,699
so this document has 239 pages and if I

138
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,440
were to ask you who do you think they

139
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,020
wrote it for the answer would be I think

140
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,940
it's safe to say they wrote this for

141
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,100
researchers people in this community to

142
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,039
pick up on hashes look at infrastructure

143
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,660
and maybe find out something more so

144
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,220
it's information sharing

145
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,460
they not they didn't have journalists in

146
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,340
mind uh is what I would like to think

147
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,840
because they're not telling me this

148
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,479
they're reaching out to the community

149
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:38,699
and I want you to I want to walk through

150
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,740
this one document so you get a better

151
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,960
understanding how as a reporter I do

152
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,479
interact with their findings so in 2020

153
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,580
they had an entry and that entry was

154
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,900
about a group called muddy water

155
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,020
supposedly operating out of Iran and

156
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,000
they were able to find a server and that

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,400
on that server there was a txt file with

158
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,280
communication logs and the communication

159
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,720
logs basically dealt with in

160
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,120
connections made by the victim received

161
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,460
by the C2 server so I read that sentence

162
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,139
and thought to myself okay this might

163
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,479
mean that I might be able to talk with

164
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,000
affected entities with

165
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,220
um so-called victims I don't like the

166
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,220
term victims but yeah

167
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,080
um they said they are what they were

168
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,560
victims in Pakistan turkey US Canada and

169
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,780
Germany the Emojis I'm not showing right

170
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,000
here I don't know why

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,560
um and

172
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,319
here is what they published right at the

173
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,940
below you can see the hash file it's an

174
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,880
md5 hash and the file name so a couple

175
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,880
of years ago I would this is where my

176
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,199
research would have stopped because I

177
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,880
don't have a virus total account there's

178
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,860
no way that I'm going to get the data

179
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,259
and nowadays I know obviously if I ask a

180
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,080
researcher hey I have an md5 hash for

181
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,060
you it's up on virus total can you can

182
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,860
you pull that file for me and send it my

183
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,500
way most of the researchers will say yes

184
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,000
because they're nice people and they

185
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,100
want to help a journalist in need

186
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,720
basically and here's what that file

187
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,720
looks like it's just base64. I wrote a

188
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,400
script to decode it here are two

189
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,319
relevant IP addresses we'll talk about

190
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,300
briefly and this is cyber Chef which

191
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,639
does that automatically for you the two

192
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,740
IP addresses again the one thing to know

193
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,960
is one line per connection you have the

194
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,300
IP address you have the user agent that

195
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,060
was received by the C2 server here the

196
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,680
two IP addresses and the thing you need

197
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,660
to know about these IP addresses is that

198
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,699
they were not included in Clear Skies

199
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,400
blog post unfinished raw threat

200
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,259
intelligence document

201
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,080
to be frank they have good reasons for

202
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,180
not including these IP addresses and

203
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,680
you'll understand in a second why that

204
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,199
is but what I want you to understand is

205
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,900
how reporters will look at what you

206
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,819
publish but also compare it to the

207
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:50,340
primary sources and look at what is in

208
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,380
there that you did not speak about so

209
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,020
these two IP addresses belong to Bayer

210
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,599
again is a German company they are one

211
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,280
of the most valuable ones doing chemical

212
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,099
part of the chemical industry

213
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:04,319
and at that point I'm hooked because I'm

214
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,599
thinking okay so buyer again Network

215
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,240
buyer against network was reaching out

216
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,759
to this C2 server and we know that it is

217
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,060
operated by muddy water that could be a

218
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,800
new story so I started talking with

219
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,960
researchers and wanted to understand

220
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,340
whether I might be able to find

221
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,759
additional proof I wasn't and the

222
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,520
interesting thing about bio again was we

223
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,280
published a story a year ago so this was

224
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,580
in 2019

225
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,860
was actually breached by another entity

226
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,020
called win NTI so I thought to myself

227
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,958
okay if they were breached in 2019 who's

228
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,580
to say that where that they weren't

229
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,320
breached a year after that happened

230
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,839
again uh just by a different apt which

231
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,300
happens quite often

232
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,860
I had no proof and there are always

233
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,899
other explanations that can be possible

234
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,180
which is why as a journalist you always

235
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,040
have to reach out and ask for comment

236
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,720
because we just can't publish what we

237
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,240
have without giving the other side the

238
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,580
chance to react to our findings and

239
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,220
here's what what bio again told me it's

240
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,140
in German it's all translated they they

241
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,720
said nothing to worry about these two IP

242
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,640
addresses are part of our cyber defense

243
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,980
center we use it to run and check for

244
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,720
malware to better protect our Network

245
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,380
and for me there was an interesting

246
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,880
investigation if you want for uh

247
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,680
especially for the reason because I came

248
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,440
to understand with this concrete example

249
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,080
that just having a C2 server and seeing

250
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,640
who connects to it doesn't have to mean

251
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,279
anything really and

252
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,320
um also there was no story that was

253
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,420
published because there was no breach

254
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,180
but as a journalist it's also important

255
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,459
sometimes to just look at something and

256
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:42,959
come away with a better understanding

257
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,360
that might not always result in a story

258
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,080
so to recap if you want to publish

259
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,100
something

260
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,399
you really can't choose your audience as

261
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,380
a researcher even if you tailor it to a

262
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,420
technical community if a journalist

263
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,660
knows people who are kind enough to walk

264
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,180
them through specific findings

265
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,940
they will get that information as well

266
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,620
so you can't choose the audience that's

267
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,380
why you're telling me reason number one

268
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,240
um oh I forgot can I have water

269
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,519
I don't need a glass

270
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,180
uh I'll keep talking thank you very much

271
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,160
um the second reason is you're telling

272
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,540
me this because you don't know you're

273
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,580
telling me this so basically in your

274
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,440
industry you have a thing called TLP

275
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,380
which is thank you which is traffic

276
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,500
light protocol which uh a way for you to

277
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,240
understand what information is to be

278
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,920
shared and what not red is you don't

279
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,839
share it Amber is I think within your

280
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,480
organization in green you can share it

281
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
um

282
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,360
journalists have a similar kind of rule

283
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,940
set it's um there are three rules and

284
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,380
I'll walk you through them quickly the

285
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,880
first one is on the record if you talk

286
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,800
with the research reporter

287
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,839
and you haven't agreed on anything then

288
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,440
by default everything you say is on the

289
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,720
record meaning they it can be used in an

290
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,880
article you can be quoted I can name

291
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,640
your company I can tell my audience who

292
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,200
you are and how you know what you know

293
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,660
the second rule is on background on

294
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,480
background means I can agree with you

295
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,820
before we start our conversation that

296
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,579
some things you say I can use but other

297
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,560
information I'm not allowed to use so I

298
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,140
can quote you but I can't tell my

299
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,180
audience that you work at I don't know

300
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,160
at Google or mandiant or whatever then

301
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,440
you'll be an anonymous source Anonymous

302
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,079
not to me but Anonymous to the audience

303
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,300
and the third rule is off the record of

304
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,040
the record basically means nothing you

305
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,279
say will be used for publication at all

306
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,079
this conversation never happened

307
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,240
so what I do is I almost always keep it

308
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,100
off the Record and immediately you might

309
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,779
think why would I do that if you tell me

310
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,700
something interesting and I can't use it

311
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,760
then I'm at this disadvantage what's the

312
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,660
benefit

313
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,519
so unless I'm pursuing a specific story

314
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,680
I want the researchers to be as open as

315
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,480
possible so if I talk with them and they

316
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,640
have in the back of their mind hey if I

317
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,260
talk about that stuff it might get me

318
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,839
into trouble so I rather not mention it

319
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,140
that's of that is to my also to my

320
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,000
disadvantage so I thought it's better

321
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,760
for me to keep it off record and if

322
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,860
during the conversation something pops

323
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,019
up that's interesting I will ask a

324
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:24,600
question like

325
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,519
um I would love to follow up on that am

326
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,440
I allowed to reach out to other peoples

327
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,839
and find out um what you were referring

328
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,300
to and uh here's a concrete example I

329
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,640
was talking and basically just gossiping

330
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,519
with a researcher and it resulted in a

331
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,380
story The researcher told me hey there's

332
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,300
a government agency they sent out an

333
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,339
alert and in that alert they were

334
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,980
talking about an apt group that was

335
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,860
targeting the automotive industry in

336
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,839
Germany I thought to myself I

337
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,300
interesting enough can I follow up on

338
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,920
that the person said sure do you think

339
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,760
no worries and I again he mentioned if

340
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,100
you if you are able to get that agency

341
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,260
alert look for the IP addresses I was

342
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,660
able to get the alert and again there

343
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,600
was an IP address this time I looked at

344
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,480
passive DNS data the thing you had you

345
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,040
need to know is the group the government

346
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,320
agency was talking about is called ocean

347
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,360
Lotus allegedly they're operating out of

348
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,120
Vietnam and um

349
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,880
I have now two um three pieces of

350
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,920
information one I have the alert so the

351
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,720
attack is ongoing otherwise the agency

352
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,540
wouldn't have sent out that alert two I

353
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,459
know that's about uh that it is

354
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,260
targeting the automotive industry and

355
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,000
three with the IP address looking just

356
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,760
at passive DNS data I have a time frame

357
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,980
and I can look and see that these two

358
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,940
domains BMW thailand.org and

359
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,220
bmw-corp.net well

360
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,860
part of that specific IP address I did

361
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,079
some further reporting and was able to

362
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,060
find out that BMW in fact had been

363
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,540
hacked by ocean Motors during a specific

364
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,700
time frame I think it wasn't again in

365
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,860
Spring 2019 the attack has used cold

366
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,880
strike

367
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,720
and BMW at one point noticed the ongoing

368
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,399
intrusion monitored the hackers and

369
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,839
kicked them out afterwards before they

370
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,720
could reach Munich so reason number two

371
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,700
why you are telling me this is because

372
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,339
what because I tried to create an

373
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,040
environment environment in which you

374
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,079
might feel safe enough to talk openly

375
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,700
about things and the reason I'm doing it

376
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,079
is because we might have different

377
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,820
understanding of the word interesting

378
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,459
researchers talk about techniques about

379
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:32,399
uh about new botnets apts and what they

380
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,320
do new techniques they're using and so

381
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,600
on and journalists will always ask the

382
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,339
question okay how did they use it and

383
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:40,440
who did they target

384
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,540
which brings us to reason number three

385
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,399
why are you telling me this um do you

386
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,500
want me to do something this one seems

387
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,720
obvious but let's think it through so

388
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,060
during the ocean Lotus investigation

389
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,300
um many researchers I spoke with asked

390
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,620
me why are you so interested in the

391
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,480
automotive industry these guys are known

392
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,699
for targeting dissidents especially

393
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,980
those living abroad but also living in

394
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,959
Vietnam you might want to look into that

395
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,720
I was given two blog posts one is this

396
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,779
by velocity in 2017 and this one by uh

397
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:11,540
Trent micro in 2018

398
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,100
and the researcher basically told me

399
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,199
just have a look at the iocs all you

400
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:19,139
need to do what I did uh was to find

401
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,000
this delivery document in the trend like

402
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,760
for blog post a shot 256 it was again up

403
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,500
on virus total but also on hybrid

404
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,240
analysis and what I love to do is after

405
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,279
pulling the file especially if it's a

406
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,720
delivery document there's so much

407
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,399
information who they are targeting and

408
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,160
why and here's a screenshot from the

409
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,980
hybrid analysis sandbox I think and you

410
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,880
can clearly see it says Stuttgart is a

411
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,399
city in southern Germany and there was a

412
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,260
conference that is organized every two

413
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,959
years and in 2018 it was taking place in

414
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,699
Stuttgart so what the researcher wanted

415
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,339
to wanted me to do but they didn't say

416
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,680
that explicitly was to come across that

417
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,260
you got a piece of information and then

418
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,180
just reach out to the organization to

419
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,100
the the one who organized the conference

420
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,920
and if they speak to me I might be able

421
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,320
and publish an article and then the

422
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,720
community will learn as well why these

423
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,399
groups are targeting these specific

424
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,620
people which is what I did and here's

425
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,040
that person

426
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,940
um he organized the conference he came

427
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,360
to Germany in the 70s he's quite well

428
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,240
known in in Vietnam he writes about

429
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,740
um he had a public he published a

430
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,620
magazine in which poets and political

431
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,500
activists discussed Pathways for Vietnam

432
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,940
to democratize

433
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,040
and he didn't know about the ongoing

434
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,860
thing which is just for one second if I

435
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,720
understand it correctly some of the

436
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,699
researchers will not reach out to the

437
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,680
affected entities and tell them that

438
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,779
they've been targeted for two reasons

439
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,120
one it might be intimidating like oh you

440
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,160
want to you're telling them hey you've

441
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,079
been hacked and now by our product that

442
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,120
is why many people don't do it and the

443
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,339
second reason seems to be if you have

444
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,620
hundreds of targets are you going to

445
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,180
reach out to all of them so they might

446
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,740
not end up doing it but as a journalist

447
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,779
it's my job to do that to talk with as

448
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,339
many people as possible

449
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:09,359
and in that case I we spoke with him he

450
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,799
didn't know that he was being targeted

451
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,500
he wasn't too surprised because

452
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,839
um he said he told us that the governor

453
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,579
of Vietnam has a clear interest of

454
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,540
finding out what they are willing to do

455
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,520
when it comes to Vietnam

456
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,579
and he is the second person

457
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:28,199
Hugh he's known as the win Trader on

458
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,299
Facebook 200 000 people are subscribed

459
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,820
to his updates and

460
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,460
um he was sent a specific spear phishing

461
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,559
document now the interesting and here is

462
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,960
that document and the interesting thing

463
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,820
about this document is

464
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,720
um

465
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,900
when he received it around the same time

466
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,640
he had heard that the government of

467
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,559
Vietnam was paying somebody to attend

468
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,960
the conference and then report back to

469
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,539
the government what who attended and

470
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,160
what they were talking about and the

471
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,780
interesting thing to me personally is to

472
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,299
see how cyber Espionage might uh

473
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,640
intertwine with actual ongoing physical

474
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,640
presence regular Espionage and this is a

475
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,520
good example for this so the email is

476
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,980
well timed it is in the weeks before the

477
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,780
conference is supposed to take place so

478
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,480
obviously uh I don't know if I wouldn't

479
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,940
have clicked on the link which and if

480
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,679
you clicked on the link because he

481
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,020
didn't notice that the email at the

482
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,419
sender there was a expert th so it

483
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:25,919
wasn't actually from the conference but

484
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,900
from the hackers

485
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,500
um

486
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,600
we published our findings and after we

487
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,660
did that Amnesty International did their

488
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,940
own analysis and also was able to

489
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,520
basically corroborate our findings

490
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,559
so this is reason number three why I

491
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,820
know what I know because people

492
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,700
researchers want uh to find out anything

493
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,280
some specific information they might not

494
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,200
be able to do so so they pass it along

495
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,140
and then by us publishing get more

496
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,880
context to better understand how a

497
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,340
specific apt group is operating

498
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,039
which brings us to reason number four

499
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,980
and that one is you want to use me which

500
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,320
is fine you can try journalists have

501
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,260
huge platforms and if we publish in like

502
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,720
our story in the main news it'll reach

503
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,340
millions of folks so if you have

504
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,200
interesting research by any means reach

505
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,380
out it's PR it's part of regular there's

506
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,840
nothing wrong with it it has it it has

507
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,000
its place but

508
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,860
um if we look at the reporting that's

509
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,720
out there uh which groups are writing

510
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,419
about most uh of them are

511
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:30,480
allegedly operated out of China Iran

512
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,860
North Korea and maybe Russia because

513
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,260
there are many reasons for this uh just

514
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,840
to name one there's no known ransomware

515
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,640
group operating out of Germany and if

516
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,280
there is please let me know and the

517
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,960
assumption would be that if there would

518
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,840
be a group like that uh law enforcement

519
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,580
agencies will prosecute them and try to

520
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,080
put them in jail which is not always the

521
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,640
case especially when it comes to

522
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,200
ransomware groups operating out of

523
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,280
Russia

524
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,660
but

525
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,460
um the interesting thing is that these

526
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,440
countries are also strategic considered

527
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,299
to be strategic adversaries to the US

528
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,360
and to Germany which makes it useful for

529
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,380
me because I can try to use it to my

530
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,780
advantage this person so we did a

531
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,940
podcast on a group called apt-28 this

532
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,360
person is Dimitri body and he tried to

533
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,160
exfiltrate all the emails out of the

534
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,140
Parliamentary office of then Chancellor

535
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,720
Angela Merkel but in the malware he

536
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,400
wrote he made a mistake and that mistake

537
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,980
was he forgot to delete his pdb path so

538
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,900
law enforcement officials knew what his

539
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,720
client was called it had the name

540
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,000
Scaramouche and they're able they were

541
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,860
able to tie their names garamush to

542
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,840
Dimitri Badin and then there's an arrest

543
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,820
warrant against him

544
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,860
and during that investigation I talked

545
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,720
with many people and I had sort of the

546
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,940
feeling that apt-28 didn't seem to be

547
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,640
that big a deal anymore this was in 2019

548
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,640
2020.

549
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,760
which was curious to me because apt-28

550
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,340
did hack the DNC in 2016 and the German

551
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,039
Parliament in 2015 on Mark the mark on

552
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:05,220
March in France in 2017. so why are they

553
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,900
not a big deal anymore I started asking

554
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,120
around and I was pointed to this article

555
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,880
by ESET it's called on Route with

556
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,980
setting it and it's a part two I think

557
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,660
and in it they describe a tool called

558
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,059
external external is for reaching

559
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,559
machines that are not connected to the

560
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,340
internet

561
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,360
and um I'm not going too deep into the

562
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,520
technical details because on our trip

563
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,200
I'll make a mistake the thing you need

564
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,020
to know is that each binary has a table

565
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,400
composed of 256 rows and

566
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,760
the client wants to authenticate to the

567
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,380
server it's really the client and the

568
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,299
server was wants to do the same as well

569
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,240
and the server what it what the server

570
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,419
is doing is basically using a pre-chosen

571
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:51,600
key out of the table of 256 rows and

572
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,480
encrypting this string okay with it now

573
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,580
if all if all

574
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,100
binaries have the same table I asked

575
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,980
ESET and they did say to me that that is

576
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,720
what they observed all binaries have the

577
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,059
same table you can just pre-compute

578
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,900
every possible variant of that okay and

579
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,400
if you're an intelligence agency are

580
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,960
monitoring the internet you can just

581
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,059
then get an alert every time it pops up

582
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,760
and no it's an external communication or

583
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,440
it's a simulated external communication

584
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,940
one of the two things

585
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,520
which we published in our podcast and I

586
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,100
had a conference I was on a panel at a

587
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,960
conference and afterwards was approached

588
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,960
by a government official from a European

589
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,580
intelligence agency

590
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,799
and basically he also confirmed it

591
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,020
happened but also said the way uh

592
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,700
intelligence agencies work if you have a

593
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,799
finding like this you'll share it across

594
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,020
your partners and this is why I think I

595
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,960
haven't uh like this is not me 100

596
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,780
knowing it but this is why I assume why

597
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,360
what I assume that the US did know about

598
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,600
it as well France as well and I don't

599
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,480
know the UK maybe so reason number four

600
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,460
is you want to see somebody fail and

601
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,440
that's why you speak to a reporter and

602
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,200
try to use it because you think it's in

603
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,960
the public interest to know

604
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,960
good but my battery is running low

605
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,120
do I have it like is this your I have 10

606
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,600
minutes left

607
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,559
um

608
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,659
reason number four why are you telling

609
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:19,559
me this

610
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,900
it's the last one it's because it's

611
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,120
already public and to be frank there's

612
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,860
so much information out there I'm

613
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,900
personally interested in open source

614
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,539
information I want to find out how I can

615
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,640
write my scrapers to find usernames and

616
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,280
all that stuff there are many

617
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,080
interesting newsletters here's one it's

618
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,760
called weekend Olsen if you are

619
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,559
interested in just cyber security news

620
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,659
here are three newsletters uh this week

621
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:44,460
in security risky business news and bad

622
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,620
cyber if you are interested in just

623
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,780
education uh he is the internet Storm

624
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,480
Center putting up their research if you

625
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,640
want to follow specific

626
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,460
um malware you can subscribe to Yara

627
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,820
rules on malware but uh this is my inbox

628
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,919
for our kobel strike Beacon

629
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,740
and um how do you keep track the obvious

630
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,600
answer is you can't you can't keep track

631
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,179
it's just too much so whatever you

632
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,640
assume that I have seen that Viral tweet

633
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,860
that just lit up in your community most

634
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,860
often I didn't just pass it along via DM

635
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,700
please uh that would be very nice so but

636
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,500
the thing I want you to understand is

637
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,960
that for me it doesn't have to be a

638
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,940
disadvantage to not see everything the

639
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,039
second it happens and for that let's

640
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,860
talk about the mid NTI case with NTI I'm

641
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,299
not going to go into the discussion

642
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,039
whether they're in group or an umbrella

643
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,720
the one thing

644
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,299
um that's important is that we received

645
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:42,780
a tip back in 2019 that with NTI stored

646
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,460
the

647
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,539
the Target in their actual malware so in

648
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:51,480
a PE file within the overlay they would

649
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,820
just tell you hey this is who we are

650
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,799
targeting this is a screenshot from a

651
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,659
blog post published by Kaspersky and

652
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:00,059
where it says Tech was here there was

653
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,520
the campaign ID so the victim name and

654
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,200
the victim in that case was a well-known

655
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,460
Global pharmaceutical company

656
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,280
headquartered in Europe we got the file

657
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,080
I wrote a script to look at the overlay

658
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,580
and was able to find out that it was

659
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,460
rush in that case so we knew that we

660
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,740
could do this we knew that it would make

661
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,559
sense to write a Yara rule we set up an

662
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,080
account on virus total they gave us a

663
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,419
two weeks trial with a retro Hunter of

664
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:29,340
30 days or 90 days 90 days I think and

665
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,659
um we got

666
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:34,440
also through other sources close to 300

667
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,779
binaries analyzed them and here's one

668
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:40,620
another screenshot you can see the

669
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,840
domain and the domain is hanker group is

670
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,659
hankel is a German company also um

671
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:47,039
chemicals

672
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,039
they were targeted by Van NTI as well we

673
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,799
teamed up with the researcher a reversal

674
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,080
called moditz Contact I think he's with

675
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,059
Google Now I'm not sure and he basically

676
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:01,380
looked at what we did and improved our

677
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,299
script and we just analyzed all the

678
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:06,120
pieces of binaries so to keep in mind

679
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,220
this blog post by Kaspersky was put out

680
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,900
in 2015. I'm looking at it in 2019 so

681
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,880
it's not it's not a new technique

682
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,679
anymore as far as I know when until I

683
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:20,039
didn't use it it was just old stuff but

684
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,600
for me as a journalist if I want to have

685
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,000
a bigger picture it can be useful to let

686
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,980
time pass and then after the fact look

687
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,080
at all the databases where all this

688
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,900
information is stored to try and find a

689
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,539
good over as good and overview as

690
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,220
possible which is what we did in this

691
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,059
case

692
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,460
right at the same time we were alerted

693
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,179
to our GitHub a script on GitHub

694
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:45,000
published by Tucson Group by the third

695
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,919
of two centrope because testing group

696
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,380
was also targeted and what they did was

697
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,480
write the nmap tool basically it would

698
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,220
tell you if you point it to an IP

699
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,860
address do they have winty on there yes

700
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,480
or no and you can see in the screenshot

701
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,620
Port 135 they did find when NTI we used

702
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,020
that script and um

703
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,240
just basically ran it against some IP

704
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,400
addresses we heard there might be a live

705
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,799
infection got some other sources as well

706
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,840
and were able to find out what companies

707
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,360
were targeted in our reporting we

708
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,940
identified some of them and if you look

709
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,440
at it you have TeamViewer you have

710
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,299
Siemens you have tests and crop buyer

711
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,580
BSF cholesterol which are all out of

712
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,159
Germany so for our audience it was

713
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,740
immediately interesting to see how one

714
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,500
group Dash umbrella targeted

715
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,419
specifically German companies within a

716
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,940
given time frame and we published that

717
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,400
information and basically

718
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,360
um

719
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,880
it was all done by publicly available

720
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,460
information nothing was secret and

721
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,900
that's the

722
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,020
I think beauty of it I'm getting I'm

723
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,659
being told this stuff because

724
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:53,159
um if you don't break any rules you

725
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:55,620
don't breach ntas this is nothing that's

726
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,419
classified you're just sending me a link

727
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:00,840
you can sidestep ndas if you will

728
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,740
in conclusion these were five reasons

729
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,799
um that we you that I wanted to alert

730
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,720
you to how reporters get their

731
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,240
information and why do this in the first

732
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,159
place you have all these companies that

733
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,880
publish their blog posts that do publish

734
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,460
their findings why why do you as a

735
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,840
journalist also need to do this stuff

736
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,480
because my answer my answer would be as

737
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,100
a journalist you always want to talk to

738
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,039
talk to affected entities and you always

739
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,799
want to look at primary resources and in

740
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:34,620
that case it might make sense to see

741
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,059
what happened

742
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:38,159
and see for yourself and check for

743
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,480
yourself and use that information

744
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,279
because as you have seen in the first

745
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,100
example in the clear sky one companies

746
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,140
are not always for valid reason

747
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,059
publishing everything they know because

748
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,880
it's not in their interest to share the

749
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,860
publicly as a reporter I want to make

750
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,919
that judgment myself also

751
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,840
I think one problem that journalism

752
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,500
covering cyber security has is there's a

753
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,100
heavy Reliance on Anonymous sources and

754
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,620
um when I write that I spoke with

755
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,500
somebody and dear reader unfortunately I

756
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,600
can't tell you who I spoke with that

757
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,520
puts me in an awkward position that the

758
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,500
reader has to trust that I did what I

759
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,760
say I did

760
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,480
but if I go and sort of try to get the

761
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,840
evidence basically myself and I can show

762
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,120
it to them and walk them through how we

763
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,100
know what we talk about in this specific

764
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,980
article if we show it and not just talk

765
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,559
about it it might

766
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,240
um give the reader a better

767
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,120
understanding of how we came to these

768
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,679
conclusions and they can judge for

769
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,320
themselves so if I then quote somebody

770
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,380
anonymously the um like the audience

771
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,840
will think okay if they have all done

772
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,299
all of this work and got the malware and

773
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:53,580
all the binaries and analyze that maybe

774
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,200
I can trust them that they also spoke

775
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,480
with someone who was aware of what was

776
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,760
happening in that hacking campaign

777
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,399
and for that specific reason

778
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,279
um

779
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,100
it is really really important because as

780
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,500
a journalist I wouldn't find be able to

781
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,039
find out any of that information myself

782
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,360
it's always somebody giving me a tip

783
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,580
it's always somebody

784
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,520
spending their time helping me better

785
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,500
understand what's happening out there so

786
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,140
I wanted to use this opportunity to also

787
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,080
say thank you for telling me all of this

788
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,919
I hope you heard something that was sort

789
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,840
of interesting to you I haven't seen

790
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,659
Helen give me the 10 minute sign so I

791
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:38,899
don't know

792
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:42,720
more than 10 minutes okay I did talk

793
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,100
pretty fast then uh I hope it was still

794
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,020
uh interesting enough and now we have

795
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,299
time for questions so I'll be around

796
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:54,899
today all day and tomorrow until 12 so

797
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:57,480
please say Hi here's my Twitter keybase

798
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,140

799
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,880
and next time I'll

800
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,799
won't talk that quickly but if you have

801
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,779
questions we have time

802
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:09,740
thank you very much

803
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,159
thank you very much I can do we have any

804
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:19,399
questions

805
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,659
okay let me ask frisk

806
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,480
uh can you just hang on a sec just

807
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,159
wondering if you have ever run into

808
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:30,899
something that really looked like a good

809
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:32,700
story but for one reason or or another

810
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,240
you were totally unable to publish

811
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,919
anything

812
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:40,080
so whether there was a story but if you

813
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,960
were convinced there was a story but for

814
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,539
some reason you just couldn't publish it

815
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:47,700
there are stories

816
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,559
um that I know of and that's the

817
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,480
disadvantaged part so people have told

818
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,299
me stuff that allegedly happened and

819
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:58,080
these are people I do trust but they

820
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,360
told me that information and confidence

821
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,779
and at one point I had to

822
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:06,059
stop and think whether I wanted to

823
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:09,200
continue talking to this person because

824
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,760
if they keep telling me stuff that I can

825
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,100
choose and my job is to publish

826
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,980
information it puts me in a weird spot

827
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,399
and I then decided uh to tell them

828
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,980
listen we can't talk about

829
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,260
all of that stuff off the Record all the

830
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,020
time because you're using me as a tool

831
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,200
to vent basically and that's why I cut

832
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,500
that specific uh conversation at that

833
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,480
point in time yeah it might be

834
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,820
frustrating to not be able to publish

835
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,679
information you think that is out there

836
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:43,700
and that's one case

837
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,899
any more questions question over here

838
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,760
hi icon

839
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,760
um so I I just have a question as a

840
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,240
reporter uh your job is to you know

841
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,100
obviously distribute information do you

842
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,659
ever feel like in doing the research

843
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:05,340
that you do that you stumble across

844
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,279
something that's so dangerous to publish

845
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,080
that you can't release it publicly

846
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,419
because of the harm it might create and

847
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:15,120
if so sort of how do you balance that uh

848
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,220
you know that dichotomy

849
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,620
um thank you for the question

850
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,340
um

851
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,580
let me answer this way so when we had

852
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,360
our story on that group called snake

853
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,039
um

854
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,559
we had to discuss and also with our evil

855
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:35,220
with the ransomware group we had to have

856
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,980
a discussion whether it would be okay to

857
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,019
publish it given that these people are

858
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,600
wanted by law enforcement agencies and

859
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,200
if we publish our story that person in

860
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,240
the our evil case he used to travel he

861
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,519
used to go to Turkey Turkey is part of

862
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:53,100
NATO and theoretically the German

863
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,600
government could have sent our

864
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,880
Expedition request and the Turkish

865
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,559
police would have

866
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,460
um

867
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,679
would have caught him and sent him to

868
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,620
Germany and we had to have a discussion

869
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,260
whether it would be okay for us to still

870
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,780
publish our findings uh it went on and

871
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,000
on we when we first had the discussion

872
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,040
we came back with the answer that we

873
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,320
can't publish right away because we want

874
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,859
to have a um we don't want to rely on

875
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:22,440
your Anonymous sources and it took us

876
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,599
two to three months I think to find the

877
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,500
Bitcoin address at that point we had

878
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,760
corroboration that wasn't reliant on

879
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,918
Anonymous sources

880
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,020
and then

881
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,599
something interesting happened which is

882
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:39,899
the real infrastructure got hacked uh I

883
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:42,480
don't know by whom but it is

884
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,080
rumored to be an intelligence agency and

885
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,460
at that point we thought to ourselves

886
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,859
listen please guys know they're being

887
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:51,599
watched closely this was after the

888
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,179
colonial pipeline hack no way these guys

889
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,800
are going to travel and since we were

890
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,720
able to

891
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,240
we had a good enough vantage point to

892
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,640
see when they were traveling or not

893
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,380
because

894
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,220
um

895
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,839
the wife would post screen on Instagram

896
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:10,980
and the next time she traveled she was

897
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,079
alone the first time she was with a I

898
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,700
don't know if they're married uh

899
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,040
boyfriend husband and the next time she

900
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,780
traveled alone and after they got hacked

901
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,359
we decided okay it's okay now to publish

902
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,940
because what's they know they're being

903
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,980
watched now and that's when we made the

904
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,140
decision but it can be tough it can be

905
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,140
hard to not publish because we don't

906
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,980
just by publishing stuff make it harder

907
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,820
for

908
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,700
uh law enforcement to do their job but

909
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,140
sometimes you still have to publish

910
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,780
we have questioned them so on the same

911
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,820
note as the previous question

912
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,280
um did you did you ever had a story that

913
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,140
was perfectly valid well documented but

914
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,300
you were told by somebody to not publish

915
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,060
it and if yes what were the reasons and

916
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,920
who told you that like officials

917
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,160
management whatever of course I

918
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,660
understand that you cannot tell just

919
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,460
everything but just to give us a rough

920
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,300
idea

921
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,700
let me let me put it that way

922
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,640
um after we published our investigation

923
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,700
on snake some people were mad at us for

924
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,579
having done so because they thought

925
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:21,300
here you have we knew that the Germans

926
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,460
also knew about these two

927
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,560
um we think to be developers of that

928
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,079
malware and they told us why why would

929
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,420
you publish that information what what

930
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,460
sense does it make to have that out

931
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,640
there given that they are wanted by the

932
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,540
police

933
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,339
and if they were to travel to Europe

934
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:40,260
they would be handcuffed and maybe you'd

935
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,460
see a trial

936
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,280
and um I mean there's not a really good

937
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,140
answer I can give you other than to say

938
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,640
it's in the public interest we do

939
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,500
discuss this internally and there are

940
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,820
sometimes people who argue against

941
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,599
publishing but I think that

942
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:56,700
um we also like what we then do is talk

943
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,140
with as many people as possible and

944
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,320
other folks told us listen uh there's

945
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,000
supposed to be a war that's going to

946
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,859
stop this was one week prior to the

947
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:08,940
invasion of Ukraine by Russia and no way

948
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,680
they're going to travel now and who

949
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,940
knows what's going to happen with the

950
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,619
war and we always have to consider if

951
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:15,420
you don't publish and somebody finds out

952
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,520
that we didn't publish how would that

953
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,820
make us look if we selectively choose to

954
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,280
not uh publish articles because somebody

955
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,619
told us not to do that's a tough spot to

956
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,540
be in I don't want to be in that spot so

957
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,599
we published that story given the

958
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:33,079
constraints

959
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,279
we have time for one more question

960
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:40,619
if we have no more questions I have a

961
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:43,500
question given the way things are going

962
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,440
do you think that malware analysis is

963
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,880
going to be

964
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,980
taught by the journalists training

965
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,760
schools in the future

966
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:54,060
so

967
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,579
what I do experience is many more

968
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:58,640
journalists who have a background in

969
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,680
natural language processing or somewhat

970
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,500
information science they started to look

971
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,540
at that stuff themselves because there's

972
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,420
so much valuable information out there I

973
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,579
myself dabbled a little bit with remnox

974
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:14,040
and so on just to do that type of thing

975
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,320
but it's hard to do and the reason I

976
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,839
don't do it as thoroughly is I'm afraid

977
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,460
I'll infect my

978
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,140
laptop so

979
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,780
it's hard to do thank you very much

980
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,900
thank you uh Joy please join me in

981
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,740
thanking hakan for

982
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,910
[Applause]
