1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,060
good afternoon

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,880
my name is jagadish I work as a malware

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,040
researcher and so forth my colleague

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,900
shindra who worked with me on this uh

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,420
unfortunately couldn't make it so I'll

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,880
be covering this part

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,020
does anyone recognize this popular

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,260
Netflix documentary image so it's gonna

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,859
connection to our presentation I'll tell

10
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,439
what's the connection in the end

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,899
um

12
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,600
shots upon we started looking about uh

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,100
shows upon when

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,020
someone we knew contacted us and they

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,260
told they lost about 85 000 in early

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,079
2020 uh sorry late late 2020 early 2021

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,820
um they got sent some fake cap

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,879
applications and then we started looking

19
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,399
looking into it under around the same

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,059
time Interpol issued a warning saying

21
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,879
there's a investment for fraud by dating

22
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,979
applications on this increase in this

23
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,920
app and the modus operandi of the but

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,220
what we have seen on the Interpol

25
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,500
article uh both had a similar modes of

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,400
trendy we started looking into it more

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,820
and it was spread worldwide and as we

28
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,380
started looking into it we learned so

29
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,820
many things in this presentation we're

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,400
gonna share those findings and also this

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,840
effort to

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,820
spread the awareness about shows upon

33
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,299
so what is upon means it's a Chinese

34
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,460
means in literally in English speak

35
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,299
butchering plate Pig butchering because

36
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:45,000
victims are groomed fat and like Pig and

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,920
in the end they are slaughtered so it's

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,740
a combination of romance often but there

39
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,320
are some variations in some cases but

40
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,899
mostly romance social engineering uh

41
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,200
with fake apps and websites

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,420
so successful shows upon execution

43
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,920
involves several stages

44
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,140
the first one according to the slang

45
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,079
used in Chinese

46
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,060
translation is packaging the first stage

47
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,060
is where you get the profiles mostly uh

48
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,560
store on profile some something because

49
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,360
some of them could be celebrity profiles

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,400
so they get this you can see a lot of

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,040
them are pretty professional looking

52
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,800
model pictures so once they have the

53
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,700
pictures

54
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,720
then they build up something account on

55
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,400
the left you can see

56
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,099
on my uh yeah on the left it's Instagram

57
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,800
right tick tock

58
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,560
um they usually have images which make

59
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,500
them look like really rich they have

60
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,540
supercars Mansions tourist places

61
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,920
uh restaurant high-end restaurant dishes

62
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,879
um

63
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,220
these profiles sometimes are built on

64
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,420
their own sometimes they purchase

65
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,800
through third party Services which are

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,920
available

67
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,540
the next stage is choosing the pig

68
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,280
so this is where the dating applications

69
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,540
comes they go through the dating

70
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,300
applications find the potential

71
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,120
ah victims all the popular dating apps

72
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,440
so you use Tinder hinge bombo and lately

73
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,459
social media applications LinkedIn Tick

74
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,060
Tock Facebook

75
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,480
the next stage once they found the pig

76
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,239
the to the dating application now next

77
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,239
stage is to remove the conversation into

78
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:28,860
messaging app like mostly WhatsApp

79
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,860
depending on the location in Korea Japan

80
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,720
they use something local

81
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,700
so this is when the grooming happens

82
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,620
so they say like a typical day say they

83
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,140
say every morning they say good morning

84
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,260
uh uh check your everyday updates and

85
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,700
you know and say good night and then

86
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,860
once they become familiar they'll start

87
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,480
uh pretending

88
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,519
to be rich and then they say oh I'm

89
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,319
supporting in this case you can see I'm

90
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,000
supporting three poor children to go to

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,220
school from the uh to until they

92
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,680
graduate on the pretend to be busy and

93
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,599
to keep fit I'm going for running

94
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,120
and a lot of cases they are either

95
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,440
investors

96
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,040
or like a Consultants or Bankers in this

97
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,980
case you can see uh they're running a

98
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,779
plastic surgery Hospital in Shanghai

99
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,978
so

100
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,979
they familiarize the so more they know

101
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,020
their date very well now the next stage

102
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,940
they start introducing the investment

103
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,419
crypto so this will tell you how come on

104
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,360
it's time to buy now I'm uh I want you

105
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,400
to invest I want you to make make you

106
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,800
rich like me and they send a link to the

107
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,860
app uh and uh and give them instructions

108
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,240
you can see on the right

109
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,199
the pointing for Apple download

110
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,360
and they walk them through to

111
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,759
installation they have the app so they

112
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,820
let them make some initial withdrawals

113
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,180
so everybody is happy now and and the

114
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,220
victim is making money so this is when

115
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,020
the big investment comes

116
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,940
so this is a big investment so you don't

117
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,520
want to be doing uh like thousands you

118
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,160
need to go to the big league uh invest

119
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,199
in the hundreds of thousands so they

120
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,840
keep sending this profits

121
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,060
um so this is where when the victims

122
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,460
invest a lot of their savings and

123
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,199
everything

124
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,740
and now they made the profits they want

125
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,020
to withdraw so they cannot withdraw

126
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,840
because they are asking for tax they

127
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,000
want to squeeze more money from the

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,340
victim in this in this screenshot you

129
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,199
can see they are asking the money and

130
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,240
they say and the victim is begging just

131
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,639
give me my money back

132
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,100
if you don't pay taxes they'll threaten

133
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,840
you to report to the authorities

134
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,460
and you can on the right you can see

135
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,979
there's a list of withdrawal records the

136
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,840
first one is Success every other

137
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,940
subsequent records is a failure so they

138
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,740
won't they won't let you take any money

139
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,300
out

140
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,539
to summarize there are stages initially

141
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,940
during app then modus messaging then you

142
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,380
install the application

143
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,419
then biggest investment comes and

144
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,100
finally the tax and everything is

145
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,259
Australia when they kick you out of the

146
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,539
application

147
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,639
so we know what shows upon is let's look

148
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,080
at the fake application and the

149
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,840
infrastructure behind this

150
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,300
so most often they use of the copy the

151
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,039
legitimate Branch because it's easy for

152
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,900
them to you know convince the victims

153
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,479
and also

154
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:25,860
therefore victims are mostly familiar

155
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,000
you can see

156
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,639
the max group bittrex and bitwalla used

157
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,800
here

158
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,319
so this is the Golden Way group uh is

159
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,580
some something we looked at the first

160
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,259
times from Hong Kong trading application

161
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,479
this is a copy of that there's usually

162
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,780
iOS download and Android download

163
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,000
let's take a quickly look at how the

164
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,020
installation works

165
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,139
so you go they ask you to download a

166
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,440
profile

167
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:14,060

00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,859
the device endurance

172
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:38,400
[Music]

173
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,039
then you install the

174
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,699
Park

175
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,699
and it takes you to a page which looks

176
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,520
like Astro page and it's asking you for

177
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,660
the

178
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,160
spinning need to be from the App Store

179
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,660
you can see 4.9 reviews

180
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,500
so you're installing the app

181
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,879
so let's take a look at the install

182
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,539
application

183
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,780
so if they ask you to register for the

184
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,080
first time

185
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,039
so know you that you have the app

186
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,740
installed so often these guys ask the

187
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,300
invitation code they have invitation

188
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,760
code they wanted they usually do a

189
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
targeted uh

190
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,019
installation so do not want others to

191
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,600
look at it maybe to avoid unwanted

192
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,220
attention or maybe they'd want to

193
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,320
research just to look at it so the the

194
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,940
app interfaces is typical they have

195
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,220
trading information and balances

196
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,640
withdrawal and things like that

197
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,860
so in the if you look into the iOS

198
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,839
applications here you can see the robin

199
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,000
hand which is a popular Robin Hood which

200
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,100
is a free training application it's a

201
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,899
copy of that so it has both native

202
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,399
applications as well as the web clip

203
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,279
which is like a shortcut of the web page

204
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,399
from your device screen

205
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,080
to support this they have a lot of

206
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,019
websites this is one of the ones um the

207
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:29,700
scene you can see the template is

208
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,580
similar they often change the logo names

209
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,600
this hopx Robin hand coinbase

210
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,140
a lot of this every uh available popular

211
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,040
cryptocurrency and trading applications

212
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,200
copy

213
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,680
and this is the App Store Pages you can

214
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,980
see there are look-alike Pages they have

215
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,260
similar structure again same logos

216
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,519
different names

217
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,519
yeah we've seen a lot of uh pretty much

218
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,060
every popular ones copied here

219
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,760
so how do they get in the device

220
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,519
um Apple App Store has a strict

221
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,779
guidelines to get in the app so

222
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,920
everything has to be signed by Apple and

223
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,100
even if you are if you use private apis

224
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,540
and you have precautions they won't let

225
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,660
you but how do they what do they do this

226
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,480
app will also let you install

227
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,420
uh like a custom apps if you have

228
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,420
profiles installed on the device so all

229
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,519
you need is you need want victims to

230
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,920
install the profiles you need to social

231
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,560
engineer them

232
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,300
so there are several methods

233
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,399
the first one is called super signature

234
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,779
which is called in the

235
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,880
in the Asian War

236
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,459
so here they use a developer account you

237
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,079
can it's also called attack distribution

238
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,920
you can install up to 100 devices so

239
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,120
this is what it looks like you can see

240
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,720
the URL so in a dark distribution send

241
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,120
over the unique device identifier and

242
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,220
then you get the app

243
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,320
ah the next method is Enterprise

244
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,940
signature

245
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,339
here you use Enterprise certificate to

246
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:11,399
install and you can see on the right it

247
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,680
says the reputation

248
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,720
platform is trustworthy and authorized

249
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,560
by Apple this method you can install on

250
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,420
a larger number of devices

251
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,620
and

252
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,300
whereas in the previous one it's only

253
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,839
100 devices

254
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,800
um so again

255
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,779
if you report the certificate to Apple

256
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,079
they will revoke on everything

257
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:35,420
installed with the certificate will be

258
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,700
invalid but what happens is once that

259
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,260
becomes similar they move to the new one

260
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,480
and the and the cycle keeps going Apple

261
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,779
do not have a like a good way to monitor

262
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,459
this this has been this is not new it's

263
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,079
been happening for a while it's been

264
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,839
abused by apds and uh and malware in the

265
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,940
past

266
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,100
uh the next method we've seen this is

267
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,540
the BDC box

268
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,940
uh somebody reported after seeing your

269
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,579
post it's a Japanese application so you

270
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:06,839
need a test flight to install this

271
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,600
so this is mostly for beta meant for

272
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,940
beta testing application but ah it's

273
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,600
abused again so install just light and

274
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,779
you can install in up to 10 000 devices

275
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:23,220
so how do they do this do they maintain

276
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,600
the infrastructure for distribution they

277
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,560
do not

278
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,320
so most of the cases especially they use

279
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,660
Asian cheap

280
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,620
installation service here you can see

281
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,579
the

282
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:35,040
I was signature sorry one of those

283
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,720
Services here all you need is a

284
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,120
application you upload the the platform

285
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,060
is ready you can send the link and

286
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,680
installation

287
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,899
so it's costs as cheap as like a couple

288
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,880
of hundred dollars and you can see in

289
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,980
the test flight signature

290
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,800
uh it's just like point nine new on per

291
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,820
device

292
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,660
and they also say if it gets draw gets

293
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,940
dropped we can give you a more stable

294
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,920
one which costs a bit more uh expensive

295
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,480
what about the Android applications this

296
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,700
is what the this for the bit feedback

297
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,940
bit Fury app is like seen earlier it's

298
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,639
got both the Android and

299
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:16,200
I was testified download you click on

300
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,040
the link

301
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,680
Android it was standard

302
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,820
they used a Cordova framework

303
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,740
and the link you can see the link of the

304
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,720
fake Comet swap

305
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,240
and in some instances they used

306
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,639
something called stringfrog which is

307
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,800
Asian

308
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,579
open source package available

309
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:41,100
created by someone from Asia software

310
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,720
sketch the strings

311
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,660
and it uses base64 plus XR nothing

312
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,300
complicated we also seen some

313
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,240
some apps using D Cloud IO again this is

314
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,579
very popular

315
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:56,120
in China

316
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,579
so now we've seen what Charles open is

317
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,380
and how the apps work how the

318
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,700
installation happens

319
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,620
I think it's also important to

320
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,700
understand

321
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,360
the how the users felt in this

322
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,800
a lot of people have lost in millions

323
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,899
UK which have come across like in

324
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,120
thousands there are some non-profit

325
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,560
organizations working on this as well

326
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,639
they have said a lot of millions of

327
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,200
dollars have been lost more people will

328
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,440
lost million in millions

329
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,680
so after we wrote a post some of the

330
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,720
comments you can see somebody who lost

331
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,940
like a half a million dollars for a fake

332
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,160
btg crypto trading site

333
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,160
and they've been asked to pay 20 tax

334
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,380
and one more case where they use test

335
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,880
flight and they lost about two seventy

336
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,420
thousand dollars

337
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,000
what about the demography uh we've seen

338
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,459
based on the Telemetry and uh on the

339
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,139
users who saw our reports and came back

340
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:59,459
to us we've seen Australia Asia Europe

341
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,880
uh North America

342
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,720
both all genders female male from

343
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,360
According to some of the police reports

344
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,300
in Asia it was the female

345
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,880
30 to 40 increasingly

346
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,000
um

347
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,100
so we look at one case study so this

348
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,320
user contracted when she uh

349
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,519
uh when she lost about million dollars

350
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,519
we asked her to share the details after

351
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,560
if it will help the research he was very

352
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,320
happy and shared and uh and communicated

353
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,459
with us to understand more about this

354
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,540
yeah she lost her pension savings

355
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,220
everything and she was asked to pay

356
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,720
about six hundred thousand dollars

357
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,800
well she has something called zbg I

358
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,660
don't know if any legitimate one exists

359
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,120
so you can see the App Store they claim

360
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,079
to be is from App Store

361
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,760
so initially at the beginning deposited

362
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,120
small amounts to test out it worked and

363
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,699
then he was willing to teach me

364
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,560
and because

365
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,680
she was installing it on her own and she

366
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,240
had the login password everything she

367
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,680
thought it's just like any finance app

368
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,199
I'm doing it so it's got to be safe

369
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,139
and then what happens is

370
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:25,199
so she gets the screenshots the the

371
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,639
crook is doing install the same

372
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,279
application on these doing the same

373
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,620
transactions and he's sending the profit

374
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,839
every every now and then saying oh look

375
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,220
at this or making this much money I've

376
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,259
invested this you come on you you need

377
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,839
to invest this as well so it's a way of

378
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,060
convincing the victim so on this right

379
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,500
you can see the withdrawal records of

380
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,019
the of the crook so

381
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,420
you can see a lot of them in millions so

382
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,300
just what convinces the victim to invest

383
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,000
more so they want to get to the next

384
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,500
stage of becoming rich

385
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,720
so and also they get like updates

386
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,240
on how much they are making so here you

387
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,459
can see in 60 seconds they made 30

388
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,419
percent

389
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:09,540
and eleven thousand dollars

390
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,379
in another case

391
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:16,980
so this is when the big investment like

392
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,839
I said earlier happens

393
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,359
um big bigger the profits beer you make

394
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,819
so they ask you to invest up to thousand

395
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,040
fifty thousand and then if you want

396
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,359
hundred percent profit you need to

397
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,520
invest like a million dollars again it

398
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,460
varies between the cases if you are like

399
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,140
depending on the financial situation the

400
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,340
numbers will vary

401
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,100
so at the end of this year about 4

402
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,380
million balance one million of our own

403
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,980
money three billion 3 million is fake

404
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,020
so this she wanted to withdraw and then

405
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,539
what happened was they asked the tax

406
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,700
so 3 million is the profit

407
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,640
and 600 000 is a tax we had lost all our

408
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,320
savings pension everything she couldn't

409
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,880
pay and then he comes up and says I'll

410
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,580
lend you the half go borrow from your

411
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,860
friends or relatives

412
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,100
and then this one they contacted us and

413
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,600
then we looked at it and it was similar

414
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,000
to what we have seen earlier and then uh

415
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,740
that's when they reported it to the

416
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,100
authorities

417
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,380
so it's easier to judge

418
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,620
so people fall for this but let's

419
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,840
understand why it happens

420
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,880
even though there are so many red flags

421
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,520
you need to install the profile the fake

422
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,340
looking pages but

423
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,200
you need to understand why they still do

424
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,460
it

425
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,559
so one of the right reason is this

426
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,940
happened during covet if you see from uh

427
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,340
2017 the cryptocurrency has really

428
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,179
raised in during 2020 in 2021 from

429
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:46,740
nothing to almost sixty thousand dollars

430
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,320
hundred tons is like almost three three

431
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,020
thousand percent in some some of the uh

432
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,660
coins like Dogecoin everything so and

433
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,280
also the finance applications become

434
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,380
really popular so we don't have physical

435
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,840
branches but you have finance apps

436
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,179
people just install and use it you know

437
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:04,919
just based on the name

438
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,140
this also convinced people to you know

439
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,559
thinking this is regular

440
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,780
so a lot of these people who got

441
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,480
affected were vulnerable position

442
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,580
uh some of them were

443
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,380
in the dating pool for longer time some

444
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,580
of them were coming out of the illness

445
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,460
some of them are widows or widowers

446
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,039
wanted you know to find their partners

447
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,799
and there was one case where he missed

448
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,660
out on the Google and apple investment

449
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,100
so he wanted didn't want to miss out on

450
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,200
the crypto so he invested all his

451
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,940
savings because he wanted to make big

452
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,039
and also the

453
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,360
platform to a specific Roswell because

454
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,520
Android and Google so it's a lot of it's

455
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,559
open most research happens with with

456
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,980
apple it's very close and and often you

457
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,039
read reports in the App Store there's

458
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,660
less malware

459
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,120
and you can see in one here one case

460
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,720
it's a one ah affected user said oh it's

461
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,940
verified by Apple and it's got a green

462
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,240
ticker I thought it's going to be safe

463
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,419
foreign

464
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,299
transactions where like I said earlier

465
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:14,940
they do initially uh

466
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,919
they do the same track transaction as

467
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,600
you and they keep sending the profit

468
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,539
they'll also convinces the victims

469
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:24,900
and this uh the data like available in

470
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,700
social media platforms it also plays a

471
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,340
big role so the The Crooks get this data

472
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,200
they know the interest they know how to

473
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,080
bait their victims

474
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,500
a lot of cases at the end when it comes

475
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,840
to the tax stage so the victims have

476
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,980
made a lot of money

477
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,880
and they know some more often times in

478
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,160
millions so they do not want to walk out

479
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,380
of this millions of dollars so they

480
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,539
somehow get more money and they put put

481
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:53,760
more money into this hoping they can

482
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,660
take the money out

483
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,640
so who is behind this

484
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,340
or who could be behind this

485
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,580
so around 2010 based on the

486
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,100
some of the data seen the Asia started

487
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,260
uh targeting in China Taiwan

488
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,780
it was mostly gambling online casinos

489
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,260
similar similar Motors apparently

490
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,700
um they convince you and then they said

491
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,799
the summary Insider get the money

492
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,720
and then they later on moved to uh

493
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,760
invest Investments and cryptocurrencies

494
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,100
and then Chinese law enforcement started

495
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,039
cracking down all the

496
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,140
ones at the bottom of the chain got

497
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,360
caught the one the big pins at the top

498
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,860
of the chain that fled to the small

499
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,559
Southeast Asian countries the Cambodia

500
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:46,080
Myanmar uh some Malaysia Philippines

501
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,880
and then in 2019 uh covet happened it

502
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,260
really helped them to expand to Europe

503
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,900
and Americas because in the first case

504
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,760
what happened they used a fake profile

505
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,220
it happened in the UK so you say you had

506
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,919
a break profile fake UK address and then

507
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,940
every time he wanted to meet

508
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,140
they wanted to meet he kept on saying

509
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,299
this covid-19 I can't meet you and he

510
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:11,280
kept on making excuses this helped big

511
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,880
in the in the success of overseas

512
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,500
execution of shahz upon

513
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,380
um when the polar polish Chinese police

514
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,280
got

515
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,080
did the Crackdown they they got some

516
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,520
records

517
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,520
um uh from the people that caught based

518
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,200
on that this works like a corporate

519
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,159
structure

520
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,679
they have a head office and agents who

521
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:36,900
work like a franchise they have a friend

522
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,419
that's which handles uh trafficking

523
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:42,659
on-site management Logistics

524
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,179
and the crime handling

525
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,280
on the habitat group as well which

526
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,620
handles the app websites and things like

527
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,620
that and finance related operations will

528
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,539
be handled by the finance team

529
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:59,400
and the last one is the key borders

530
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,140
keyboarders are the ones who actually

531
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,840
chat with the victims you can see this

532
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,460
was based on the report from the wise

533
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,380
which they did recently

534
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,059
um based on the information from the of

535
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:11,640
the non-profit organizations so you can

536
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,679
see a lot of iPhones as well maybe it

537
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,240
could be something could be Android as

538
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,280
well they're doing a group chat

539
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,400
and a lot of these keyboarders or

540
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,200
traffic victims

541
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,419
so especially when covid-19 happened in

542
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:25,980
Asia

543
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,780
so a lot of them couldn't meet their

544
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,940
daily needs as well because there's no

545
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,559
job nothing and then you see these

546
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,559
AdWords across the border and then yeah

547
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,780
you want to you go go there and then

548
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,340
they're taken in the vehicle they

549
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,260
confiscate their passports

550
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,760
and

551
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,400
and then you do it or if you don't you

552
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,820
will be you know subjected to tortures

553
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,940
and you'll you paid commission based

554
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,799
salary but most often they don't pay you

555
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,360
commission they sorry because everything

556
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,280
will be treated as expense

557
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,520
so this was one of the the used training

558
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,460
script to train the trainees is this

559
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,260
again from the data corrected from the

560
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,720
Chinese post records so you can see they

561
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,240
tell the give a training to what to send

562
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,559
to their

563
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,780
um uh victims like keep sending the

564
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,440
backs luxury repair luxury bags jubility

565
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,840
twist uh attraction pictures

566
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,100
and keep saying them to work hard you

567
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,960
know come up and send high-end

568
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,480
restaurant meal a restaurant picture

569
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,700
Meal Restaurant pictures

570
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,780
Etc

571
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,179
this was from the like a previous

572
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:38,760
version the new one could be you know

573
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,900
much different

574
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:46,260
so we also uh

575
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,020
check when one of the apps pretended we

576
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,299
have uh victim and you can see here this

577
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:52,919
is a fake kraken app

578
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:54,900
and we asked where to where should we

579
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,100
send the money you can see the center

580
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,679
Hong Kong Shanghai banking limited

581
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:01,260
address it could be a mule account you

582
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,158
don't know it didn't follow through

583
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,020
so what next

584
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,860
I swear is this still active but with

585
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,020
coin 19 going down on the cryptocurrency

586
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,400
going down I think it's made a pretty

587
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,039
major part is slow down a bit

588
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,760
so if the if it happens in the UK it

589
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,919
goes to the action fraud based on the

590
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,080
feedback from the affected users

591
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,120
so action floor has not taken much

592
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,340
action FTC

593
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,220
um has an agent who is looking at this

594
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,440
they say there's a lot of cases but

595
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,140
because it's cross-border they haven't

596
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,159
done anything

597
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,740
so far none of them who are directly uh

598
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,120
communicated with has been able to

599
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,679
recover any funds

600
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,760
except one case where we contacted the

601
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,659
local

602
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:54,659
Finance reporter and then the bank was

603
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:58,559
being kind and they partially gave the

604
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,799
refund like half the what they invested

605
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,020
just sort of courtesy and there was one

606
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,640
case where I read where the crypto app

607
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,740
was able to you know recover the money

608
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,140
before we were sent

609
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,600
on top of that once they come out there

610
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,460
there are so many recovery scams and so

611
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,860
I'll I'll get the money back pay me some

612
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,840
money so it's also this

613
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,700
so how can we how can we overcome this

614
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,799
because of the decentralized of the

615
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,240
cryptocurrency against become a problem

616
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,179
for traceability so it's an advantage

617
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:31,980
for the crooks so it's difficult to see

618
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,059
where it's going

619
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,279
so it's also playing a major role

620
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,279
to combat this I think we need a

621
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,799
Collective response from like government

622
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,480
our Platforms in the finance Tech

623
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,600
because if you search for a finance app

624
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,600
or any banking application or you know

625
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,740
cryptocurrency applications there's

626
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,419
hundreds of them

627
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:54,360
um just uh you really if you are not not

628
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,299
a well Savvy person it's difficult to

629
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:58,919
know which is real which is fake maybe

630
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,900
we should have a like a registered

631
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,820
government or to register where we can

632
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,440
you know users can cross check what is

633
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,700
there what's not there

634
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,299
so it's often difficult to see

635
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,640
your work you know reaching end user in

636
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,240
our case we are uh fortunate to see some

637
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,059
of the feedback we were able to you know

638
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:24,659
stop some of the people from investing

639
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,340
into this in some cases a lot of cases

640
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,320
they usually come to us at the time of

641
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,960
the tax stage where they couldn't help

642
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,299
but some of them read our reports

643
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:35,159
earlier and they were able to Google

644
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:38,039
search and then see that it's a you know

645
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:41,640
really a fraud

646
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,460
so this is this was in the

647
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,960
one of the training skip this is what

648
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,960
their motto is there's no unscamable

649
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,059
person everybody needs just needs the

650
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:55,980
right script so that's what motivates

651
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,900
them

652
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,179
last but not least the the documentary

653
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,880
was this net the Tinder Fender maybe you

654
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,020
heard of it

655
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,000
so in our case it's virtual they don't

656
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,640
meet each other it was in Tinder Tinder

657
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,279
swindler it happens in real case of a

658
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,140
similar to what happens uh in our

659
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,400
inshallah upon

660
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,120
that I want to complete my presentation

661
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,100

662
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,279

really a question I just want to share

670
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,740
some experience not my experience I mean

671
