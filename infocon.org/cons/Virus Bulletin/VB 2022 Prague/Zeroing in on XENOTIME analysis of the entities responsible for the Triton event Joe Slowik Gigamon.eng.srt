1
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,880
uh my name is Joe slowik and we will

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,639
talk to the Zeno time threat actor

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,920
zeroing in on xenotime and the analysis

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,080
of the entities

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,260
question responsible for the Triton

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,140
event so who am I other than someone who

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,939
is very much enthusiastic about Ronnie

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,980
James Dio I currently lead threat

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,900
detection engineering and threat

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,180
intelligence operations for gigamon and

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,039
their threat Insight product previously

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,599
I've worked at domain tools the US

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:31,920
government and the department of energy

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,079
in the U.S Navy and done some other

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,820
things as well but that's not all that

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,800
important instead today we're going to

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,200
talk about uh a couple of things

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,480
centering around a threat actor that

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,160
will just for convenience sake use the

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,579
xenotime moniker to have this discussion

21
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,260
we'll begin with when we first learned

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,760
about this entity and talked to the

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,600
Triton event from 2017 then get into

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
activity linked to this actor following

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,899
the 2017 incident in Saudi Arabia then

26
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,699
we'll look into who was responsible for

27
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,920
this activity and how this aligns with

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,320
developers actors and operators when it

29
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,540
comes to complex cyber intrusion

30
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,180
operations and conclude with the

31
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,640
discussion on Flex attribution concerns

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,200
so not the most technical talk that

33
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,700
you'll see at virus bulletin but

34
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,380
something that all of us as threat

35
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,119
intelligence practitioners or

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,400
contributors need to be mindful of when

37
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,860
examining certain types of intrusion so

38
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,860
first Triton trisis hatman because of

39
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,840
course we have different names it's been

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,000
labeled the malware that can kill or the

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,280
world's most dangerous malware which is

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,320
a little misleading because the malware

43
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,479
itself as analyzed by multiple parties

44
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,400
including Mandy and dragos and the

45
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,860
United States cyber security and

46
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,740
information security agency sisa was

47
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,880
really a tool designed to allow for

48
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,560
unnoticed or unlocked modification or

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,960
arbitrary modification to a safety

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,700
instrumented system in an industrial

51
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,740
environment we'll speak to what a safety

52
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,140
instrumented system or CIS is shortly

53
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,840
but the main idea is that the Triton

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,060
malware was designed as one piece as

55
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,239
part of a broader intrusion so we start

56
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,340
with copper oops that wasn't the right

57
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,860
button we start with compromising the

58
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,360
information technology environment

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,459
fairly standard stuff there then

60
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:19,379
pivoting into the operational technology

61
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,900
Network in order to enable the more

62
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,300
worrisome cyber physical scenarios that

63
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,000
gave this incident a such notoriety but

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,620
as part of that this wasn't just deploy

65
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,260
Triton install it and walk away but

66
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,120
rather the threat actor compromised the

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,560
plant's distributed control system

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,620
environment that operated the oil refine

69
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,599
the petroleum Products Manufacturing

70
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,180
complex that was breached and then

71
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,519
Triton was used in parallel with this in

72
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,700
order to try to disable or modify safety

73
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,400
controls within that environment and

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,360
then

75
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,459
well quite frankly we don't know because

76
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,500
like many events that have taken place

77
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,540
within the industrial space in stuxnet

78
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,239
someone had to say it today uh this

79
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,739
didn't quite work out as planned and

80
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,120
we're going to explore why here

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,819
momentarily now first just an aside on

82
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,040
Safety Systems it's important to note

83
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,080
that Safety Systems Safety instrumented

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,840
Systems specifically operate as a

85
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,780
intermediate step between the sort of we

86
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,099
can

87
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,379
bring a plant under control should

88
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,599
something adverse happen versus getting

89
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,700
into physical engineering controls like

90
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,280
brake valves blowout valves ditches and

91
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,959
dikes or whatever for product overflow

92
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,819
and other things that can still maintain

93
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,440
some degree of safety or limit the

94
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,480
damage of an event but require much

95
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,120
significant uh a much more significant

96
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,280
investment of resources and effort in

97
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,140
order to adequately contain and have

98
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,700
hazards such as venting product and

99
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,340
similar items so the safety layer that

100
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,500
you see here represents where the CIS

101
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,200
steps in to try to make sure that bad

102
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,879
things don't get significantly worse

103
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,860
when they become harmful or potentially

104
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,560
dangerous things so interacting with or

105
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,420
manipulating such a device Within These

106
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,340
networks represents a very Brazen

107
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,739
attempt to enable not just physical

108
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,780
damage but also potentially putting

109
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,239
plant operators and employees at risk

110
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,099
should adverse conditions manifest

111
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,580
however as we look at Triton the

112
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,159
intention of this event was likely to

113
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,620
again Bridge the environment access the

114
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,720
OT environment government compromise the

115
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,399
plant Network as well as the safety

116
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,919
Network deploy Triton and then use

117
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,080
Triton as a way to modify the safety

118
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,180
logic within the environment so that

119
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,759
some change in the DCS Network would

120
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,500
propagate beyond the safety layer to

121
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,840
induce a destructive event that would be

122
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,940
very very bad and probably would result

123
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,860
in someone getting hurt if not killed

124
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,600
unfortunately for the actors

125
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,060
unfortunately for us at the moment that

126
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,220
Triton was deployed instead the CIS

127
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,900
faulted and it in fact it kind of

128
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,220
operated like it's supposed to and that

129
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,080
it shut the plant down so certainly a

130
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,660
very costly a very expensive situation

131
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,360
but a far cry from the worst case

132
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,580
scenario of having something like a

133
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,220
explosion or other harmful event to take

134
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,139
place within this environment precisely

135
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,960
why this is the case is not completely

136
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,360
clear so certainly as with all the virus

137
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,220
bullets and presentations please do

138
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,960
check the paper for additional details

139
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,340
on this we only have a short time today

140
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,220
to discuss but uh important to note that

141
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,199
again the adversaries screwed up or

142
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,940
didn't take note of some something and

143
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,220
as a result Triton those still scary was

144
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,960
not as bad as it could have been given

145
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,000
the capabilities deployed and the

146
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,380
networks that were targeted in this

147
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,520
incident

148
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,860
but it didn't stop

149
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,960
after Triton was announced to the world

150
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,380
in approximately November of 2017 the

151
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,900
folks at mandiant released a report that

152
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,460
not only provided additional details

153
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,800
about the intrusion but also importantly

154
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,380
provided some attribution linking the

155
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,479
event to a Russian research facility the

156
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,280
central Research Center or Center for

157
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,419
chemical and mechanical research we'll

158
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,280
get into them very shortly but what was

159
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,780
interesting about this report from an

160
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,160
intelligence perspective is the language

161
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,919
that was used specifically most likely

162
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,139
is strange that's not exactly a your

163
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,600
typical confidence interval or

164
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,880
estimative language being used so it was

165
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,860
unclear whether this was just the

166
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,900
attackers happen to use some tools and

167
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,600
preliminary parts of the operation that

168
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,979
happened to be linked to some employees

169
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,199
of This research institution or if this

170
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,000
institution was materially involved it

171
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,620
was an open question at the time for

172
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,660
many given lack of evidence and other

173
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,880
items but what was interesting about

174
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,039
this uh reporting is that it started to

175
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:27,539
give us at least a name to this threat

176
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,940
actor so while uh mandate has called

177
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,800
this temp Bellis which you don't really

178
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,539
see that often and so that's why I'm

179
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,520
using the xenotype marker instead

180
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,620
because that's been more

181
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,900
popularly used more frequently used in

182
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,340
public reporting and that's the label

183
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,080
applied by dragos but what's interesting

184
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,360
is that for such a significant and

185
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,979
important threat these are the only

186
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,020
references that we see to this entity no

187
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,720
bears no apts no Tas or anything like

188
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,699
along those lines it's really been an

189
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:56,100
under investigated and underexplored

190
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,900
threat when it comes to multiple vendors

191
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,520
and you could make the argument for well

192
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,620
Triton was a one-on-one event we just

193
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,479
don't have that much data right

194
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,160
well not necessarily because we see

195
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,780
follow-up actions linked to the same

196
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,699
adversary or elements of this adversary

197
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,800
happening shortly thereafter

198
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,800
so mandiant reported on uh intrusions

199
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,600
that they linked to this actor going on

200
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,300
in parallel with the Triton event as

201
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,280
well as other events that they were

202
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,319
responding to as an incident response

203
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,599
company dragos was able to identify

204
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,819
targeting in the electric sector as well

205
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:29,220
as the oil and gas industry representing

206
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,259
a shift in this adversary's targeting to

207
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,599
additional industry verticals beyond the

208
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,360
the original oil and gas targeting in

209
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,039
the Middle East so it seemed like this

210
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,319
entity was becoming much more profligate

211
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,000
or much more

212
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,620
um

213
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,900
confident in its abilities and spreading

214
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,759
into additional industry verticals and

215
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,259
additional regions including North

216
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,660
America and potentially Europe as well

217
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,400
but then things got really interesting

218
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,740
especially on the attribution front when

219
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,599
the United States Department of the

220
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,400
Treasury Office of foreign asset control

221
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,479
ofac uh sanctioned not just a government

222
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:06,180
but a very specific organization namely

223
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,919
the central scientific research

224
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,199
institute of chemistry and mechanics who

225
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,819
will be referred to henceforth as

226
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,860
schnickem because it's a funny way of

227
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,419
saying it

228
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,400
um and it's also the only how I've seen

229
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,780
it referred to in a lot of circles when

230
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,039
referring to this institution so

231
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,680
schnickem it is uh the important part

232
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,020
about this though is what the U.S

233
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,120
government initially linked schnittem to

234
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,819
not writing Triton not even deploying

235
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,919
Triton but rather building customized

236
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,260
tools that enabled the attack that's a

237
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,820
very narrow slice of the overall

238
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,099
intrusion and kind of tied back into the

239
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,080
original mandate reporting that was only

240
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,760
able to satisfactorily link the

241
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,860
intrusion to some of those enabling

242
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,959
tools as opposed to the ICS capability

243
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,959
itself or to the actual execution of

244
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,760
that capability within the victim

245
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,440
environment so it's seemed like you were

246
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,080
still operating at a half measures

247
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,399
degree at this point Without Really

248
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,779
knowing who was responsible for the

249
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,880
events in question but then things got

250
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,540
really interesting

251
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,500
year actually in March although this

252
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,540
indictment was originally released but

253
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,500
not public publicly disclosed in 2021

254
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,000
the United States Department of Justice

255
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,660
indicted not just the lab schnickem but

256
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,480
a specific individual Evgeni galatic who

257
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,860
was mentioned by name multiple times

258
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,320
within this indictment as being not just

259
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,240
involved with this intrusion but as the

260
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,740
person who was hands on keyboard

261
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,560
according to this indictment for in

262
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,300
breaking into the environment and even

263
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,060
deploying the Triton framework on the

264
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,260
safety controller and the victim

265
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,660
environment this report also disclosed

266
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,120
that there was a 2018 attempt in the

267
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,160
United States on the oil and gas

268
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,660
industry that although it didn't result

269
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,180
in any sort of disruptive event like we

270
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,420
saw in Saudi Arabia in 2017 nonetheless

271
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,120
represented a desire on the part of the

272
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,760
adversary to map out and attempt to gain

273
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,500
access to critical National

274
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,540
infrastructure within the United States

275
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,339
along similar lines to what was observed

276
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,620
in Saudi Arabia so when it comes to

277
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,360
specific attributions statements it

278
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,980
doesn't get much more specific than this

279
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,440
and this indictment while it's not the

280
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,140
most exciting reading is interesting to

281
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,580
see that there's a precise timeline

282
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,060
given of Mr gladkick's actions in terms

283
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,100
of when tools were deployed when certain

284
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,560
tools were executed leading up to the

285
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,720
two attempts to execute Triton within

286
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,760
the victim environment in Saudi Arabia

287
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,860
so at this stage we can make a fairly

288
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,620
safe assumption that uh

289
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,140
schnickem and this individual were

290
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,060
involved in what took place however

291
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,980
what's interesting about this indictment

292
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,779
is that it still limits the

293
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:39,660
responsibility for the Triton event to

294
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,260
the execution of the attack the

295
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,459
development and deployment of certain

296
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,560
custom tools used in the attack but says

297
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,660
nothing about who developed Triton other

298
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,940
than the Glad kick was the individual

299
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,860
that deployed it so an ongoing mystery

300
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,480
over that responsibility

301
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,880
uh again this is in much greater detail

302
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,380
in the paper please check it out if this

303
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,760
is interesting to you after we're done

304
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,100
but we see that xenotime represents not

305
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,540
just an entity responsible for this

306
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,660
Triton event in 2017 but rather has a

307
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,279
history of actions going back to the

308
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,740
first times that some of the enabling

309
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,839
tools the very specific custom tools

310
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,660
that were used in the 2017 incident were

311
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,540
developed in 2014 all the way through

312
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,860
expanded operations in 2020 and 2019

313
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,140
targeting the electric sector and other

314
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,700
critical infrastructure outside of the

315
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,440
Middle East so an actor that's been

316
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,360
fairly active that has tried a very

317
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,899
spectacular attack uh in at least one

318
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,060
known incident but still failed it has

319
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,740
some degree of immaturity given what we

320
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,360
saw in the Triton event not quite

321
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,519
succeeding as it was likely planned so

322
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,500
where does that leave us well it leaves

323
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,540
us with multiple entities pointing to a

324
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,440
single

325
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,040
um organization linked to the Triton

326
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,500
incident uh mandiant the U.S department

327
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,940
of the treasury and the U.S Department

328
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,279
of Justice it is interesting given the

329
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,320
amount of attention on Russian Nexus

330
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,060
cyber operations especially since

331
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,519
February of this year that we have not

332
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,440
seen additional reporting from other

333
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,320
organizations such as the UK ncsc or

334
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,600
others tying this to Russian operations

335
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,579
and this entity as far as we can tell

336
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,860
has not been linked to any operations in

337
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,300
Ukraine thus far

338
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,620
so we're really left with a very

339
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,600
narrow view of just what schnickem is

340
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,279
and what their responsibility what

341
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,560
remains within the overall scope of

342
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,720
Russian cyber operations but before

343
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,459
getting into that in Greater detail we

344
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,019
have to ask ourselves what is this lab

345
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:34,680
we know Gru we know FSB we know svr when

346
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,360
we talk about Russian cyber operations

347
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,399
we don't hear this name very often

348
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,079
except in the context of the Triton

349
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,240
incident so this is from its website it

350
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,139
looks like they have a very nice

351
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,420
building so that's pretty cool they've

352
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,920
been around for a while though so since

353
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,380
the 19th century where this organization

354
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,480
worked to develop smokeless powder for

355
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,339
the Russian army the then Imperial

356
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,200
Russian army and has remained through

357
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,019
both the shift to Communism and then in

358
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:01,019
the post 1989 1991 time frame is still

359
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,899
an active part of the Russian military

360
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:05,820
complex in looking at schnickum they

361
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,320
have a responsibility for a number of

362
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,500
items uh explosive research going back

363
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,600
historically to their roots to things

364
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,459
like space weapons Advanced chemistry

365
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,740
and Metallurgy and similar items very

366
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,360
much reflective of what we would also

367
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,519
see seeing organizations like the U.S

368
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,320
National Laboratories or other such

369
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,360
institutions that combine basic

370
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,579
scientific research with military or

371
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:29,220
national security applications what was

372
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,740
interesting about the U.S indictment

373
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,360
though in a naming that's one specific

374
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,459
individual is responsible for deploying

375
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,980
the Triton tool is that there's a very

376
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,560
specific organization within schnittem

377
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,279
called the apply Development Center ADC

378
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,480
that at least according to the public

379
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,160
website is responsible for things

380
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,959
including the defense of critical

381
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,519
National infrastructure from cyber

382
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,040
threats in the United States government

383
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,260
indictment they emphasize that this

384
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,440
public record of work on Cyber defense

385
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,100
is also linked to a non-public offensive

386
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,959
cyber operation linked to that Institute

387
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,820
as well what is interesting about all

388
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,200
this though is that this website is no

389
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,540
longer available uh it is it was taken

390
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,579
down not that long after Mandy and

391
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,860
initially reported on schnichem's link

392
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,380
to the Triton event and then this

393
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,899
website was no longer available publicly

394
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,760
for anyone to look at so that may be a

395
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,220
data point that's worth revisiting but

396
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,839
certainly very curious

397
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,060
but most importantly we sneeze we see

398
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,300
schnickem as having a role based upon

399
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,399
our three primary data sources the

400
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,380
Mandate reporting the Department of

401
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,079
Treasury sanctions and then the unit the

402
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,180
justice department indictment as

403
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,579
developing support tools performing the

404
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,579
intrusion including a line by line uh

405
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,740
Recreation or walk through of what

406
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,800
gladkick did on Console in the event in

407
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,040
2017 and then executing the Triton tool

408
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,720
but what's very interesting about this

409
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,279
sequence of events is that we don't see

410
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,899
any mention of the Triton development

411
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,660
here at all whereas we would expect

412
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,620
based upon the nature of the

413
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,839
organizations involved a scientific

414
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,760
research laboratory that also happens to

415
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,519
do cyber related research and planning

416
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,860
you would expect this organization to be

417
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,420
the entity that actually developed

418
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,160
Triton yet no mention of that

419
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,720
development anywhere even though we were

420
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,420
able to identify certain other I.T based

421
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,519
enabling tools as developed by this

422
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,459
institution so very curious uh if you

423
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:24,779
read line by line through the indictment

424
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,639
and there are some

425
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,680
choices and wording that are a bit

426
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,240
ambiguous and leave some room for

427
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,279
interpretation as to who is responsible

428
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,660
for what and whether or not other

429
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,000
entities Beyond schnickem may have been

430
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,740
involved in the event again I refer you

431
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,240
to the paper for additional details

432
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,060
there so we can't rely on these sources

433
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,540
as sparse as they are as being

434
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,100
definitive statements about what

435
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,199
zenotime is and what organizations were

436
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,600
involved but it does give us a clue that

437
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,120
it seems that this is more than just the

438
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,279
single research laboratory that was

439
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:59,220
engaged in this intrusion so Triton and

440
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,199
zenotime what does this look like well

441
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,060
King Triton here and I tried to keep

442
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,800
this you know fairly above board with no

443
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,500
means but I had to get this guy in

444
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,820
um you know certainly we need to develop

445
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,560
a capability develop a tool such as

446
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,600
Triton that is able to work ideally in

447
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,519
the targeted industrial environments a

448
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,560
non-trivial ask and something that is

449
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,959
not very easy for many organizations to

450
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,060
accomplish or succeed within but then in

451
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,740
addition to that you need to breach the

452
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,120
target so you need your initial access

453
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,120
team to fish the organization move

454
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,339
laterally gain persistence within the

455
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,320
victim environment Etc not something

456
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,820
that you would ascribe to a malware

457
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,500
author who does things like reverse

458
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,660
engineer a safety controller or similar

459
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,720
system and finally finally need to

460
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,519
deploy that capability within the

461
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,680
environment itself which given the

462
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,259
distinctions between it and OT

463
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,079
operational technology environments is a

464
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,579
non-trivial distinction while there are

465
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,040
many similarities with it systems there

466
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,480
are also very important differences

467
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,000
where having special knowledge may not

468
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,920
just be desirable but critical to ensure

469
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,600
Mission success and perhaps this is one

470
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,640
reason why the Triton event failed at

471
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,859
this execution phase now it is an

472
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,000
interesting to look at this because

473
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,859
these represent

474
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,859
vastly different capabilities in terms

475
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,199
of function knowledge and experience

476
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,720
required in order to take these on and

477
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,640
so we have to ask ourselves is it

478
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,559
realistic is it even likely to

479
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,079
anticipate that a single unitary entity

480
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,720
whether that be the specific individual

481
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,380
name evgeny gladkick or the ADC is a

482
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,360
specific organization or even schnickim

483
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,640
as a whole was responsible for each

484
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,500
phase of these operations and that

485
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,880
doesn't even get us into who told them

486
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,980
to do this because presumably This

487
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,380
research laboratory was not operating on

488
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,900
its own accord but was tasked to develop

489
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,940
this tool and deploy it in an

490
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,400
environment by someone who was legally

491
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,919
or otherwise responsible for giving such

492
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,600
tasking to these sorts of organizations

493
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,700
so this gets us into a position where

494
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,740
we're seeing a very complex interaction

495
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,980
of capabilities as well as authorities

496
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,140
involved in order to execute an event

497
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,360
such as this and if you look further

498
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,500
you'll see that there's an entire

499
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,660
ecosystem and this is just focusing on

500
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,460
Russia there was a report that released

501
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,100
earlier this week on Cyber test ranges

502
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,660
in the People's Republic of China for

503
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,820
example the United States as I mentioned

504
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,260
earlier has organizations like the

505
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,500
National Labs excuse me the doe National

506
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,720
Laboratories organizations like miter

507
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,820
the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics

508
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,679
laboratory recently responsible for

509
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:30,240
helping to shoot down an asteroid which

510
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,340
is pretty cool but in the Russian

511
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,640
context there's an entire series of labs

512
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,140
institutes and public-private

513
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,480
Partnerships that provide capability

514
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,280
enhancements to Russian intelligence

515
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,620
military as well as specifically cyber

516
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,140
operations what's unique about these

517
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,580
organizations though if we start looking

518
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,919
at this as it relates to Russian cyber

519
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,440
actors overall is typically we see these

520
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,660
organizations operating in support roles

521
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,880
for various entities within the overall

522
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,039
ecosystem of Russian threat actors so

523
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,340
fsigvant Associated and has been linked

524
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,740
in other government indictments to the

525
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,559
Federal Security Service the specialized

526
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:08,880
security Computing devices and

527
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,679
automation Institute to the foreign

528
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,660
intelligence service and then this

529
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,220
Federal service for Technical and Export

530
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,460
control is the entity that that

531
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,860
maintains responsibility for schnickem

532
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,260
among other organizations and is tied to

533
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,419
Russia's Ministry of Defense what's

534
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:25,679
unique about these though is that while

535
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,780
we can see a very definite relationship

536
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,640
in terms of providing expertise and

537
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,320
capabilities in support of these

538
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,419
organizations we don't see something

539
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,820
like providing the actual operators that

540
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,799
are breaking into victim environments

541
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,780
and deploying what is essentially a

542
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,820
Cyber attack tool within that victim

543
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,559
environment which is very unique and

544
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,539
potentially very concerning in that we

545
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:47,940
may be dealing with a ecosystem of

546
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,500
threat actors that goes beyond this

547
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,580
typical big three of FSB svr and Gru to

548
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,559
also include various public-private or

549
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,539
institutional actors that have different

550
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,400
command and control different lines of

551
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,900
authority as well as different ways of

552
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,760
operating than the adversaries that

553
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,220
we're more used to interacting with

554
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,260
so what does that mean well it means

555
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,820
that cyber operations are pretty damn

556
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,260
complicated if any of you have done

557
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,179
offense to any extent or red teaming

558
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,220
you'll know that doing it effectively is

559
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,720
not easy

560
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,980
um especially when we're talking about

561
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,960
complex environments and targeting

562
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,460
things like critical National

563
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,260
infrastructure and operational

564
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,660
technology environments thus we would

565
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,460
anticipate there to be subdivision of

566
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,440
labor among various parties to achieve

567
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,539
complex outcomes the development of a

568
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,100
tool such as Triton would go to one

569
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,440
organization the breaching and

570
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,000
surveillance of an or the victim

571
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,980
organization to some other entity and

572
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,419
then the actual execution of the

573
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:41,280
intrusion and the attack to some third

574
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,799
entity perhaps so as a result we can

575
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,480
look at this as a case study that you

576
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,960
know perhaps our Reliance on associating

577
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,660
single entities like xenotime to

578
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,580
intrusions as complex as the events such

579
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,960
as Triton as well as subsequent

580
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,120
intrusions globally

581
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,280
leave something to be desired and that

582
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,559
one actor is rarely responsible for All

583
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,320
Phases of intrusions like we've seen in

584
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,820
this particular case

585
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,860
so if we were to revisit Triton we could

586
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,720
assess with pretty high confidence based

587
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,940
upon the sources available to us that

588
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,220
xenotime does not represent a single

589
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,520
unitary actor let alone just this one

590
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,740
named individual from the U.S Department

591
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,600
of Justice indictment but rather

592
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,360
represents a link potentially a one-time

593
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,220
link among various organizations

594
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,220
including schnicken and the ADC

595
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,980
used to achieve this objective in Saudi

596
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,380
Arabia for reasons unknown

597
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,419
um that makes things pretty dicey and

598
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:37,860
you may be asking yourself like isn't

599
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,539
this just so much cyber threat

600
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:42,299
intelligence Arcane trivia or whatever

601
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:43,679
at this point and what does this really

602
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,020
matter for the practice of cyber threat

603
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,460
intelligence and responding to such

604
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,539
events

605
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,640
well first you know looking at xenotime

606
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,380
we can see this as a composite of

607
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,299
multiple entities with a range of

608
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,760
actions associated with it probably

609
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,500
revealing a complex in a relationship

610
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,720
with various groups likely residing

611
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,520
under Russia's Ministry of intelligence

612
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,480
potentially involving uh the military

613
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,760
intelligence organization or Gru which

614
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,280
part is unknown but the thing is we

615
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,360
still don't know a lot of critical

616
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,640
elements of xenotype activity who task

617
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,280
them to take this action in Saudi Arabia

618
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,320
who's responsible for tasking Zeno time

619
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,240
to do further probing of critical

620
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,559
infrastructure in Europe and North

621
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,659
America and how this entity might

622
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,059
actually behave or operate in the

623
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,860
context of that of a conflict like we

624
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,020
see in Ukraine presently and more

625
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,000
worryingly potentially elsewhere as we

626
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,159
see with the Nordstrom pipelines that

627
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,559
things seem to be getting a little out

628
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,000
of hand

629
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,860
but why does any of this matter to us

630
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,780
well it matters because we need to

631
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,280
improve our understanding of events in

632
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,200
order to appropriately categorize and

633
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,480
figure out just what is going on that

634
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,400
means understanding and accepting that

635
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,020
cyber operations are not the functions

636
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,960
of unitary actors that just as if we

637
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,000
were to say the National Security Agency

638
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,520
in the U.S it has tens of thousands of

639
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,980
employees it is not just an agency but

640
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,419
represents multiple organizations

641
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,120
operating under one Authority the same

642
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,340
for the ministry of State security and

643
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,200
the People's Republic of China the same

644
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,820
for Russian cyber operations whether

645
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,760
we're talking under the uh defense

646
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,520
Ministry or under internal security and

647
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,500
so we need a greater appreciation and

648
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,240
understanding for how these complex

649
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,820
adversaries emerge and what that means

650
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,740
for how they can interact and basically

651
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,919
combine in coalitions of the willing or

652
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,539
of the necessary given the mission at

653
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,460
hand with different organizations to

654
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,559
enable different effects the result is

655
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,780
that attribution becomes really freaking

656
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,659
hard uh attributions already a complex

657
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,820
problem I'm not saying don't do it but

658
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,559
I'm saying be very careful with doing it

659
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,900
but this mix and match approach of

660
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,700
different organizations collaborating in

661
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,860
different phases of intrusions means

662
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,200
that attributing based upon only one

663
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,120
aspect or one observed aspect of an

664
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,799
intrusion means that we are likely

665
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,020
missing the grand picture in terms of

666
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,640
just what capabilities are brought to

667
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,740
bear to enable these sorts of operations

668
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,780
and what that means in terms of tracking

669
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,940
campaigns and subsequent actions moving

670
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,679
forward and tracking something as

671
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,620
specific as a piece of malware we may be

672
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,900
tracking the capability development

673
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,900
entities while completely missing the

674
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,460
initial access and lateral movement of

675
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,900
groups responsible for enabling these

676
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,580
intrusions to begin with which arguably

677
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,679
is much more important from a defensive

678
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,320
perspective thus as threat intelligence

679
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,659
professionals unitary attribution and

680
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,280
naming may be inappropriate and we

681
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,200
should look for these sorts of

682
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,520
interconnections as much as possible to

683
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,039
come up with a more accurate and

684
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,500
realistic approach to how we identify

685
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,600
and track these sorts of adversaries and

686
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,820
so for CTI analysts that means that our

687
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,559
jobs have just gotten a bit harder we

688
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,360
need to accept that and move on and try

689
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,100
using what sources are available to us

690
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,960
to unearth as many of these links and

691
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,179
responsible parties as possible to gain

692
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:55,919
an accurate view of just what is going

693
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:56,940
on

694
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,500
so that's all that I have and I'm right

695
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,080
at time almost again please check out

696
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,580
the paper if this was interesting as it

697
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,260
goes into much greater detail on a lot

698
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,940
of the items that I discussed as is

699
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,220
intended at virus bulletin if you have

700
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,419
any questions I think we have time for

701
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:12,120
maybe one or two and feel free to stop

702
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,559
me in the hallways or at the reception

703
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,760
this evening if you'd like to discuss

704
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,200
further

705
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,640
well well thank you Joe

706
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,080
so that said are there any questions

707
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,799
from the audience

708
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,960
it's difficult to see with the light up

709
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,980
here can you please wait for the

710
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,340
microphone

711
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,179
um do you think the like splitting up

712
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:40,799
between the agencies are going to be

713
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,700
like more common nowadays from the yeah

714
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,440
perspective uh yes I would agree we even

715
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,059
see it in criminal ecosystems with

716
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:50,460
initial access Brokers plus uh

717
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,380
ransomware Affiliates and the actual

718
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,720
ransomware controllers operating in

719
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,460
terms of complex criminal Enterprises

720
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,860
where different parties specialize in

721
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,080
various parts of the overall cyber kill

722
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,700
chain or whatever you want to phrase it

723
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,559
and if we're talking about things like

724
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,419
very complex state-sponsored operations

725
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:08,880
like trying to physically damage an oil

726
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,860
and gas production facility we're

727
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,480
talking about a non-trivial combination

728
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,400
of very specialized capabilities that

729
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,440
would be unrealistic to expect all

730
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,320
housed not just within one specific shop

731
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,299
uh as part of an organization but even

732
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:22,919
potentially within one organization

733
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,400
itself

734
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:30,320
any other questions

735
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,659
so I have one yeah you actually said

736
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,460
that attribution is hard and you had the

737
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,159
ecosystem of uh the whole product of the

738
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,980
whole event with so many groups involved

739
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,779
yes

740
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,820
how difficult is it that you're really

741
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,120
sure to attribute it to this one rather

742
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,580
than that they have copied like ideas or

743
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,500
code from another group no that's an

744
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,880
excellent question in fact I wrote a

745
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,520
paper uh on this subject last year that

746
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,200
was presented at the first cyber threat

747
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,480
intelligence uh focus group

748
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,559
um it's published through domain tools

749
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,820
if anyone's interested in the detailed

750
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,919
argument but yeah the answer is that you

751
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:06,720
have to be very careful and that's why

752
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,900
when we get primary source documents so

753
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,539
that's a combination of first first-hand

754
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:14,159
technical data like incident response

755
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,380
reporting from the Indian and then the

756
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,240
government disclosures which again we

757
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,799
have to ask ourselves like okay we can't

758
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,360
just blindly trust that the US

759
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,159
government or the British government or

760
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:24,720
the Czech government or whomever is

761
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,820
getting everything right 100 of the time

762
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,860
but for these entities to make public

763
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,840
statements in these fashions

764
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,580
typically gives us a sense of security

765
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,840
that they would make this sort of

766
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,279
statement without having fairly firm

767
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,080
evidence on their side just for fear of

768
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,340
embarrassment or what it would mean to

769
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,140
get it wrong and by combining these

770
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,179
sources we can come up with a composite

771
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:43,559
view of events that could allow us to

772
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,419
make still with estimated language

773
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:47,760
involved statements linking these sorts

774
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,740
of incidents to specific parties but it

775
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,179
doesn't happen very often where we can

776
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:53,159
get as specific as we potentially have

777
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:55,860
in this case okay

778
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,940
so anything else any last question

779
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,799
the only other thing I will say is happy

780
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,960
Saint wences last day for those who are

781
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,059
Czech and thank you for everyone for the

782
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,919
event for working on a holiday I really

783
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,260
we really appreciate it and uh yeah

784
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,900
thank you and also uh resources

785
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,120
well join me in thanking Joe

786
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,500
[Applause]
