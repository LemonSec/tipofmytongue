1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,540
hi everyone and um thank you so much for

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,179
taking the time to attend my talk today

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,920
if the last talk in the sessions I

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,559
promise to keep it a bit um shorter some

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,120
Alexander milakowski you can call me

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,560
Alex as well

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,560
um I'm currently with um Sentinel Labs

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,779
at Center one however I did this

9
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,080
research while I was at Cyber reason

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,359
um so today we will talk about uh

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,720
encryption encryption tactics techniques

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,700
um and more specifically about the

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,219
blackhead Transformer which is also very

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,579
trending these days especially

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,100
uh so um

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,219
in I in the eyes of our community there

17
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,500
is a big um

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,539
shift in the trend now on the ransomware

19
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,800
scene

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,379
um so instead of doing full file

21
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,020
encryption ransomware operators turn to

22
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,480
doing intermediate of partial file

23
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,059
encryption so and even so instead of

24
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,000
doing file encryption even uh there have

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,860
been recent reports of ransomware

26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,260
operators namely blackhead Affiliates

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,140
doing given file corruption right

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,680
so there are mainly two reasons for this

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,200
um shifting techniques so the first is

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,600
time so with intermittent encryption

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,939
ransomware operators need significantly

32
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,820
less time to encrypt a file and without

33
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,680
the whole system right and that is what

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,540
we will discuss also today in this talk

35
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,520
so the less time they need to encrypt

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,200
the system the lesser the chances that

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,299
they will be detected and discovered and

38
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,280
stopped in that process so there is an

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,220
obvious benefit there the second reason

40
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,799
is evasion so with intermittent or

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,439
partial encryption ransomware operators

42
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,900
can also evade detection systems that

43
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,600
for example evaluate intensity of file

44
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,060
IO file input output operation or

45
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,680
systems that may be calculate or

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,659
evaluate similarity between two versions

47
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,820
of a file one encrypted one unencrypted

48
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,079
plain text

49
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,180
and with intermittent encryption there

50
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,159
is a possibility to evade

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,619
um such systems

52
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,240
so let's review some of the recent

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,098
ransomware as I mentioned before this is

54
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,080
a current Trend now it's also a trend

55
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,760
that we covered very recently in a

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,760
sentinel Labs cost so let's review some

57
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,520
recent very fresh ransomware families

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,260
that do intermediate or partial file

59
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,300
encryption so the first one is the

60
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,340
agenda ransomware as you can see it

61
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,500
implements several encryption modes such

62
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,200
as skip step percent and fast which in

63
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,239
summary encrypt either the beginning of

64
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,940
a file or encrypt a file in kind of a

65
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,459
stepwise fashion right in crypto certain

66
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,980
set of bytes leave a next set of bytes

67
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,720
plain text or unencrypted and encrypt

68
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,459
the next set of bytes and so on until

69
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,500
the end of file is reached

70
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,319
uh so we have the play ransomware also a

71
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,819
pretty new player

72
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,040
um what they do is they basically split

73
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,519
a file divider file into multiple equal

74
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,920
sized chunks

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,080
um of a fixed size and then they encrypt

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,540
only a specific specific number of child

77
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,800
chunks depending on the total file size

78
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,900
we also have the black buster ransomware

79
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,760
I'm sure most of you have have heard

80
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,860
about it it was really a trendy

81
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,140
especially a couple of months ago a very

82
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,739
uh new big player on the scene so what

83
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,720
they do they also started to encrypt

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,200
files in a in a stepwise session

85
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,480
and we have the quick ransomware which

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,879
is maybe the newest member in this group

87
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,860
um we still haven't found a sample to

88
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,500
analyze it I still haven't taken a look

89
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,420
at its encryption techniques but we

90
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,980
observed the auto boasting on

91
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,080
underground forums like how they do

92
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,940
intermittent encryption which is what

93
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,620
all the cool kids are doing these days

94
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,599
and we thought okay fair enough we will

95
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,760
include it in this list

96
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,560
and finally we come to the blackhead

97
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,379
ransomware which is um basically in the

98
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,599
focus of this talk

99
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,299
so first a bit of context info about

100
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,940
this trade actor and the operation for

101
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,760
those who of you who may not have heard

102
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,640
about it before so blanket is seen its

103
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,900
Essence is a ransom as a service

104
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,840
operation right and among especially

105
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,760
among the reverse engineer Community was

106
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,220
known as the first

107
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,840
um ransomware to be written in the rust

108
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,580
programming language that made it a bit

109
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,680
painful for me to reverse engineer it

110
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,918
but um it went in the end well

111
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,860
um black cat is a or Alf v as a thread

112
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,880
group

113
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,280
um goes after

114
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,440
a pretty high profile targets especially

115
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,720
as I mentioned in this past few months

116
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,600
has been featuring the news recently if

117
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,540
I remember it was around mid last year

118
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,919
in Germany I believe that they

119
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,139
compromised an oil distributor and they

120
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,060
forced shell basically to reroute all

121
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,520
oil supplies that so that was going on

122
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,160
in the German media last year a lot of

123
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,520
this how they they became famous there

124
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,979
um also as a as a threat actor blackhead

125
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:56,340
is very very adaptable so they

126
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,680
continuously renovate refresh they

127
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,900
attack or infection Arsenal how they

128
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,940
infiltrate systems and also how they

129
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,620
encrypt files will

130
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,540
touch upon the encryption techniques in

131
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,620
a bit

132
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,540
um there were also one of the first

133
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,840
threat actors to directly threaten

134
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,479
members of victims or employees or

135
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,940
victim organizations so that was kind of

136
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,699
a additional operation technique they

137
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:21,660
applied

138
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,780
uh among all of their uh Branson Weather

139
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,739
Service competitors

140
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,300
one thing that is specific about the

141
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,639
blackhead Transformer samples is this

142
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,039
hugely sludge configuration space so

143
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,259
once I took a look at um

144
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,419
samples when they came out is what

145
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:42,479
becomes immediately noticeable is this

146
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,080
large Json formatted configuration blob

147
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,600
uh stored or embedded in the in the in

148
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,960
the executable so it contains a lot of

149
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,940
configuration variables as you can see

150
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,639
so in the context of of this talk are

151
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,620
relevant the file mode in the file

152
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,220
Cipher configuration parameters so the

153
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,880
file Cipher parameter configures them

154
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,160
symmetric encryption algorithm that the

155
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,740
ransomware uses to encrypt to encrypt

156
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,139
files so it basically can be configured

157
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,300
to AAS or with with Hardware support or

158
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,979
to the fully software implemented

159
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,680
charger 20. probably most of you have

160
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,479
heard about it chapter 20 is one of the

161
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,759
most performant

162
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,740
symmetric encryption algorithm that

163
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,620
fully executes in in software and eyes

164
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,539
with Hardware support the advantages

165
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,660
that it uses CPU features to speed up

166
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,960
encryption right so in theory and also

167
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,759
in practice as we will discuss in a bit

168
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,340
is with Hardware support should be the

169
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,780
fastest

170
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,919
symmetric encryption algorithm out there

171
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:52,919
so the file a cipher parameter also

172
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,840
suppose this third optional setting

173
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,060
which is called best and when base is

174
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,680
configured the black cat Transformer

175
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,900
automatically switches between eyes with

176
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,840
Hardware support or charger 20 depending

177
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,120
on the platform where the ransomware

178
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,460
operates whether the platform has the

179
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,800
CPU support or the hardware support for

180
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,139
eyes

181
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:15,660
for the eyes encryption algorithm

182
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,600
so the file mode

183
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,400
parameter configures the intermittent

184
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,139
encryption different encryption modes

185
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,060
that Implement intermittent or partial

186
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,280
encryption in different way which we

187
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,599
will cover

188
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,979
next so in summary blackhead supports

189
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:35,819
five individual encryption modes and one

190
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,819
combinatory which combines a couple of

191
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:40,740
these individual encryption modes but we

192
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,259
will come to that in a bit so let's

193
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,080
cover the individual first so we have

194
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,720
full encryption which is obvious I mean

195
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,520
when when the full encryption mode is

196
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,160
enabled this runs on my access any other

197
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,880
it encrypts the whole content of a given

198
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,940
file then we have hit only so head only

199
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,780
encrypts only the first n bytes of a

200
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,520
file by the way the parameters that you

201
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,560
can see above and and why these are all

202
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,000
configurable through the ransomware

203
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,039
operator right so as I mentioned before

204
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,380
the blackhead transformation it's very

205
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,479
very highly configurable even to the

206
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,759
tiniest bits

207
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,180
um the dot pattern encrypts a file in a

208
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,979
in a stepwise fashion it obviously

209
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,780
encrypts every end byte then skips the

210
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,060
next y bias encrypts again n by skips n

211
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,879
byth until the end of file is reached

212
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,039
so we go now further so they also

213
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,380
support what they call Smart pattern uh

214
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,179
and also what I forgot maybe to mention

215
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,219
all of these names

216
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,979
are basically extracted a string

217
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,419
resource that I extracted them string

218
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,760
resources from the binary right there

219
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,560
also some of them are available in the

220
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,540
help screen of the ransomware but they

221
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,700
are not the descriptive in terms of how

222
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,019
they are implemented and how they

223
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,240
actually operate

224
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,700
um the smart pattern mode what it does

225
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,399
is it first encrypts the first n bytes

226
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,620
of a file and then divides the rest of

227
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,980
the file into 10 equal blocks and then

228
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,459
encrypts P percentage of bytes into each

229
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,680
block right so this is what the n and p

230
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,440
parameters basically configure

231
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,779
and finally we have this Advanced smart

232
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,420
pattern which similarly to the smart

233
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,720
button encrypts the first invites of a

234
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,240
file but then they split the rest of the

235
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,240
file into B number of equal size blocks

236
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,760
and then they encrypt P percentage of

237
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,000
bytes inside each block so if you can

238
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,920
see all of these encryption modes are

239
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,860
pretty intricate pretty detailed right

240
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,200
and next we come to the auto mode which

241
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,560
is even more more complicated right so

242
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,200
the automotive combinatory means it

243
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,540
combines the use of the full Advanced

244
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,459
smart pattern in the dot pattern

245
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,860
individual encryption modes which which

246
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,560
I just covered and it's combinatory in a

247
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,660
sense that it applies and it configures

248
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,880
also the parameters of one of these

249
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,160
modes depending on the size of the file

250
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,160
that is that is under encryption and as

251
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,320
you can see the auto mode basically

252
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,860
considers a very large very wide spin of

253
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,279
file sizes that it that it handles

254
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,500
differently when it encounters them on a

255
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,420
system starting from less than 10

256
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,459
megabytes ending with larger than one

257
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,640
terabytes so this is this shows a pretty

258
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,680
fine granola handling of individual

259
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,600
files by the Black Cat Transformer when

260
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,040
it comes to encryption and how it

261
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,839
handles especially intermediate

262
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,880
encryption as you can see we have the

263
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,980
different encryption modes but we also

264
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,959
have different parameters for each

265
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,420
individual encryption modes if you

266
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,940
recall which I just mentioned like the

267
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,760
in the p and the B parameters right so

268
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,220
that's pretty pretty careful programming

269
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,260
right there

270
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,060
one other interesting thing to note

271
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,760
about the auto mode is this set of file

272
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,800
extensions that you see here so there's

273
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,480
a set of file extensions that's hard

274
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,540
coded in the binary but when Auto is in

275
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,540
is configured enabled on a sample and

276
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,339
when the ransomware encounters are filed

277
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,320
with one of these extensions the auto

278
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,540
mode will always apply the full

279
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,060
encryption mode which means files with

280
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,160
these extensions will always be fully

281
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,680
encrypted it won't go into this logic

282
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,540
like to check the file size if it's

283
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,519
greater than or less than 10 megabytes

284
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,519
gigabytes and so on right so I I

285
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,100
speculate we all think that maybe the

286
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,720
malware author for the trade group

287
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,940
considers files with these extensions as

288
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,220
Mission critical to victims right as you

289
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,399
can see here we have Microsoft Office

290
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,920
documents formats PDF ADF right SQL we

291
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,220
have database images and so on

292
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,019
because one thing that's important with

293
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,760
intermittent encryption which I will

294
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,279
cover also through metrics now is that

295
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,320
it leaves certain portions of the file

296
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,720
unencrypted so it would be a very bad

297
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,180
situation for the attackers for they to

298
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,040
partially encrypt a file from which the

299
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,500
victims can actually extract useful

300
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,360
information afterwards right because the

301
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,160
end goal is too too corrupt to destroy

302
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,920
the file so the so the victims can be a

303
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,540
subject to to threatening afterwards

304
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,620
so as I mentioned before we I I saw this

305
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,779
whole how much time they invested

306
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,459
basically in the in the configuration

307
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:20,459
modes and um also in the intermittent

308
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,740
encryption mode and so on and I said

309
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,720
okay then let's measure what kind of

310
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,120
impact these different modes or in

311
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,920
summary the configuration space of the

312
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,060
ransomware

313
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,279
has in practice right when when they

314
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,839
actually infect the system and when they

315
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,060
run what kind of an impact that has

316
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,459
so I consider three different metrics as

317
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,279
you can see we have the data throughput

318
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,899
measured in megabytes per second which

319
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:44,040
is the

320
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,779
um there are many ways to look at this

321
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,700
or to interpret this metric some of them

322
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,320
are it measures for example the

323
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,839
intrinsic file i o operations that's one

324
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,880
way to look at it another way to look at

325
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,740
it is the total encryption speed like

326
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,139
how fast the ransomware reads data

327
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,360
encrypts it and writes it back into a

328
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,920
file that's basically the data

329
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,440
throughput the World Cup processing time

330
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,420
is how much time the ransomware spends

331
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,160
on the encryption or even better

332
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,200
formulated on file processing which

333
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,240
means as I mentioned before like reading

334
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,700
data from the file encrypting data and

335
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,620
writing data big to the file effectively

336
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,360
corrupting the file at the end

337
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,399
and we have unencrypted content measured

338
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,560
in percentage is the amount of file

339
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,480
content that the ransomware leaves

340
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,120
unencrypted as I mentioned partial file

341
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
encryption always means that a certain

342
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,320
portion of the files will be left as

343
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,139
plain text an unencrypted form

344
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:36,240
and I also consider files of different

345
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,240
sizes between 50 megabytes up to 50

346
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,519
gigabytes the reason for this big number

347
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,260
the at the end is that I saw that the

348
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,019
auto mode supports even handling of even

349
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,180
larger files larger than one terabytes I

350
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,100
assume this is meant mostly for database

351
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,240
files and and files of similar format

352
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,540
so here's some measurement highlights

353
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,639
um I will present in this very briefly

354
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,399
today mind you in the paper that is

355
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,839
published and will be published in the

356
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,240
proceedings there are many more

357
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,800
measurement results and charts there so

358
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,339
I will just Briefly summarize today

359
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,339
um so in this scenario we measure the

360
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,100
impact of using the is symmetric

361
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,720
encryption algorithm with Hardware

362
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,880
support that's the Next Generation

363
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,459
instruction support right there versus

364
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,160
the use of the um

365
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,260
fully software implemented charger 20.

366
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,360
uh if you recall that was the file

367
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,220
Cipher configuration parameter of the

368
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,959
ransomware that configures one of these

369
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:34,920
two

370
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,019
and we have also the best value that

371
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,660
automatically switches between these two

372
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,940
um between these two algorithms the

373
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,620
encryption mode was set to full meaning

374
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,660
that the file that we encrypted were

375
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,519
fully encrypted so there was no

376
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,860
intermittent encryption here in play

377
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,320
um for a file of five gigabytes

378
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,920
we observed an increase of 51

379
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,540
approximately 51 megabytes per second

380
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,199
when using the is with Hardware support

381
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,000
encryption algorithm in a reduction of

382
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,360
five approximately five seconds in a

383
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,279
total time spent on encryption right

384
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,699
this shows that for for relatively size

385
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:12,600
of

386
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,300
files of kind of a medium-sized relative

387
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,579
what you consider a small size or large

388
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:22,019
size file this there is a specific

389
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,820
reduction in the

390
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,760
um in the a time spent on on encryption

391
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,399
for a file of 50 gigabytes

392
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,500
um I recorded an increase in 53

393
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,560
megabytes per second in the data

394
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,540
throughput of the ransomware in a

395
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,920
significant reduction of 18

396
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,060
approximately 18 seconds in in total

397
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,680
time spent on encryption so mind you

398
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,540
this is on a single file right we are

399
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,399
not talking still about system in the

400
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,620
paper there is also a summarizing result

401
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,779
that's based on the ransomware running

402
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:55,199
against a fully fully equipped system

403
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,199
right against the full file system of a

404
00:15:58,199 --> 00:15:59,940
Workstation

405
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,399
so this right there is a it's a pretty

406
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,160
significant reduction in in vocal

407
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,860
processing time uh in in local

408
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,540
processing time considering that the

409
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,100
file is encrypted using the full

410
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,500
encryption mode right so the file is

411
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,760
completely

412
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,680
um encrypted there

413
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,420
so in this scenario we measure the

414
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,110
impact of using the auto

415
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,360
[Music]

416
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,320
um

417
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,500
encryption mode versus full so just just

418
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,079
to remind the author was this complex if

419
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,480
then kind of a scenario that applies

420
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,579
different individual encryption modes

421
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,620
depending on file sizes

422
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,620
so for 500 megabytes we recorded a

423
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,980
reduction this time in around 178

424
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,019
megabytes per second in the data

425
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,360
throughput so this reduction is because

426
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,660
Auto actually uh does not process the

427
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,579
whole file if you recall it apply see

428
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,139
that the dot pattern method so that's

429
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,360
why we have reduction in data throughput

430
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,399
when compared to the full mode which

431
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,380
basically processes every single bit of

432
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,519
the file

433
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,500
but then we also have reduction in the

434
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,720
total time spent on encryption of

435
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,079
approximately one second 0.8 second in

436
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,240
this case the ransomware left around 86

437
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,299
percent of the file unencrypted

438
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,579
so when talking about large files if you

439
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,559
look at the results for a 50 gigabyte

440
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,780
file we have a very significant

441
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,880
reduction there in the data throughput

442
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,059
of the ransomware from 250 megabytes per

443
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,880
second and almost two minutes reduction

444
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,179
in the time spent on encryption so again

445
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,880
I will remind this is for a single file

446
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,520
right however the ransomware left around

447
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,360
98 percent of the file

448
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,220
unencrypted there

449
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,059
so where does it leave us and um what

450
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,460
can we conclude for that right and I

451
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,140
will remind again in the paper there are

452
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,600
many many more results however the main

453
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,640
conclusion is this one that the

454
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,860
configuration space of the ransomware is

455
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,500
is highly impactful and especially when

456
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,020
we are talking about large files so they

457
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,120
can be for example database files or

458
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,640
very large document files in the

459
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,380
configuration space it's impactful

460
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,940
across all of the metrics that we

461
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,980
observe so the data throughput the total

462
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,340
time spent on encryption and also how

463
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,760
much of file content was left was left

464
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,520
um unencrypted

465
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,980
um and knowing this where where does it

466
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,900
leave us as a security research

467
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,020
Community right so um

468
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,200
in summary we are at a turning point at

469
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,960
a precipice so obviously the ransomware

470
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,580
operators

471
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,039
they have found a way to shorten the

472
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,320
time that they spend on encrypting a

473
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,620
file once active on a given system

474
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,020
they've also found a way to to evade

475
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,179
certain detection mechanisms whether

476
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,799
mechanisms that

477
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,900
um evaluate intensity of file input

478
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,360
output operations or mechanisms that

479
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,460
evaluate similarity between the two

480
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,340
versions of a file one encrypted one not

481
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,760
encrypted and I discussed the the

482
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,620
current Trend at the beginning of the

483
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,480
stock they're obviously jumping on a

484
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,539
bandwagon all of them especially the the

485
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,760
new joiners in that in that area

486
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,740
so they obviously know where they want

487
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,900
to go so what is what is with us what

488
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,880
are what are our options

489
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,559
um so first thing first

490
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,320
infection prevention has been

491
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,840
um and remains an absolute priority for

492
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,080
us um as a community uh because if we

493
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,299
can stop a ransomware before it executes

494
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,039
of course we do not have to worry about

495
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,600
all of the things that I've discussed

496
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,120
right now right we don't have to worry

497
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,620
how fast it needs to encrypt the system

498
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,500
a file or whether it can evade some file

499
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,840
input output monitoring system for

500
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,220
instance right

501
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,760
so in that line of thought

502
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,520
it's also important to know that we as

503
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,160
the Defenders we have much more time to

504
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,620
detect a ransomware before it executes

505
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,039
than after so for example mandian noted

506
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,640
in 2021 22 sorry it's even a newer

507
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,640
report that I ransomware operators have

508
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,919
an average dual time dwell time of

509
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,200
approximately five days before the

510
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,419
Detonator runs somewhere versus the

511
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,919
couple of minutes that are transformed

512
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,360
by may need to encrypt

513
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,400
a system completely

514
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,740
right so definitely the conclusion here

515
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,720
is infection prevention is definitely

516
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,640
for us a priority

517
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,280
but where we if we can assume that

518
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,320
prevention has failed and that happens

519
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,940
in practice we just saw a couple of

520
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,100
talks a day talking exactly about this

521
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,120
scenario

522
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,780
where we in this scenario if we consider

523
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,980
intermittent or partial encryption or

524
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,280
even file corruption in play so let's

525
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,580
first talk about detection engineering

526
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,200
as I mentioned before the file input

527
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,940
output profile of intermittent

528
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,340
encryption is vastly different than full

529
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,280
encryption so that begs the question how

530
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,340
good our current file input output base

531
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,919
detections for instance is there maybe a

532
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,200
need to create new ones

533
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,120
also what about CPU and memory

534
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,580
performance signatures so encryption is

535
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,720
a process

536
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,360
that leaves CPU and memory utilization

537
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,280
footprint on the system especially on

538
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,200
the CPU site depending on the on the

539
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,000
encryption algorithm

540
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,740
could there be a way for us to develop

541
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,780
CPU and memory performance signatures

542
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,660
for detecting also at least suspecting

543
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,400
an intermittent encryption or at least

544
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,500
differentiate between intermittent and

545
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,840
full encryption right that's also a way

546
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,840
to think about it I know that Academia

547
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,520
has been making some progress in that

548
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,159
area also historically the current state

549
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:37,380
in Industry to be honest I'm not so sure

550
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,299
myself

551
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,539
also in the direction of response so we

552
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,159
discussed that intermittent encryption

553
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,620
is faster partial encryption is is

554
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,140
faster than full encryption so could we

555
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,659
also think about shortening the time

556
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,419
that we spend on evidence Gathering to

557
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:56,400
bring a verdicting responsive action a

558
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,140
bit faster so we don't let the

559
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,140
ransomware once executed destroy destroy

560
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,780
more files that we would like to and

561
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,940
especially how that counter interacts

562
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,860
with a with a potential false positive

563
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,720
rate in this game right because always

564
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,700
when we sacrifice an Evidence Gathering

565
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,460
and rush to bring a decision to save on

566
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,919
time we all we always have the danger of

567
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,980
generating FPS

568
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,500
and finally even trade intelligence I

569
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,720
mean um if we can assume that we can map

570
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,600
a given partial encryption technique to

571
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,120
a given ransomware actor ransomate

572
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,159
affiliate even because we saw a lot of

573
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,080
the ransomware that is sold currently on

574
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,820
the market support different modes for

575
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,120
intermittent encryption so if we can map

576
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,640
one technique to a given threat actor

577
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,320
and we can conclude that this threat

578
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,360
actor at the specific Affiliates favors

579
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,120
it or uses it very often can we use that

580
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,200
knowledge to basically increase

581
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,760
attribution confidence in certain

582
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,980
scenarios or in certain uh or in certain

583
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,799
investigations that we conduct right and

584
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,020
even at a very high level like if we

585
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,480
better understand what's partial or file

586
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,100
corruption techniques I use there will

587
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,720
be used there in the field

588
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,299
can we also better understand the malven

589
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,820
the ransomware market in particular and

590
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,799
also estimate even how malware

591
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,480
ransomware design will go in the future

592
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,280
because there is obviously some change

593
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,419
going on

594
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:18,059
um right now so the point that I raised

595
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:19,980
here especially in the last few slides

596
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,260
they do not uh pet India they did not

597
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,780
relate only to ransomat even blackhead

598
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,240
in particular right but to all malware

599
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,940
where the configuration space uh plays a

600
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,700
very big role it's very impactful on the

601
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,820
way that the the malva operates and they

602
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,700
belong in the same in the same category

603
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,340
so that was all from my side

604
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,320
um I'm open to any questions that you

605
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,059
may have so thank you thank you for your

606
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,930
attention thank you so much

607
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,960
[Applause]

608
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,179
thank you thank you we have time for

609
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:56,520
questions so don't hesitate there's one

610
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,940
in the front

611
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,240
um hi uh thank you for your talk was

612
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,000
really wonderful I have a question a lot

613
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,520
of concept that was that that's also

614
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,380
used in ransomware to improve

615
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,700
performance and I didn't hear you talk

616
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,440
about it

617
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,919
um if you just do a lot of calls to read

618
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,780
file density encryption and then write

619
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,679
file

620
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:25,260
that's going to be really slow if you do

621
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,600
a lot of calls so

622
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,659
um but they also do is using the i o

623
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,760
completion ports have you checked those

624
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,960
two

625
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,400
uh sorry they also use I didn't quite uh

626
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,280
they also use IO completion ports

627
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,120
yes so the i o completion processor as a

628
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,419
method in my experience I've seen it

629
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,340
personally in the context of the steel

630
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,340
bit exfiltration tool if you're familiar

631
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,200
with it right this is the exfiltration

632
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,000
tool in the Arsenal of the log bit group

633
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,400
so it's mostly used for parallelization

634
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,580
and speeding up in that way uh you're

635
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,919
fully right yes it's a method but it's a

636
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:08,100
I see it more as a parallelization

637
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,280
technique than actual file input output

638
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,679
kind of activity because the file IO

639
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,500
will always happen depending on

640
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,200
from what source right but there's a is

641
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,720
a way to speed up things definitely yes

642
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,740
it's there

643
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,880
any more questions thank you for the

644
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,220
question by the way it was don't be shy

645
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,919
I I have one do you have information

646
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,559
that when the Marvel Affiliates are

647
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,600
actually deploying the malware are they

648
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,539
using any of this feeder feature or they

649
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,880
just default too yeah we've investigated

650
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,159
several incidents and in particular of

651
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,840
the blackhead Transformer and it came

652
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,520
with pre-configured intermittent

653
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,279
encryption there yeah definitely thank

654
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,480
you

655
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,779
and many of them especially that uh what

656
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:57,419
we consider to be rather judging based

657
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:59,159
on the ttps and so on like how they

658
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:00,659
Infiltrate The System that we consider

659
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,600
to be a bit less sophisticated they

660
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,940
especially rely on the auto mode that

661
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,220
they just um that I just presented

662
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,440
because they consider it like the

663
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,779
optimal mode that the developers or

664
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,900
their owners right provide to them

665
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,760
there's another question on the back

666
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,620
yeah hi again sorry

667
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,200
um there's been a lot of talk about

668
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,640
relations between black cat in

669
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,320
particular and other ransomware as a

670
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,880
service operations

671
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,279
um including are not limited to black

672
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,799
matter and dark side

673
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,600
um I wonder whether you have any any

674
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,400
opinion on that given the the jury's

675
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,500
kind of still out on that one

676
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,659
uh you mean about the the current Trend

677
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:41,700
that I just made uh the code uh well

678
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,679
like have you seen any code overlap

679
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,980
between the two or any relationships no

680
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,539
not at this point but it's definitely a

681
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:50,820
topic that I would like to explore from

682
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,500
like in the future thank you definitely

683
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,840
on my research agenda nice point I think

684
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,120
if there are no more questions then

685
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,279
let's thank again thank you thank you so

686
