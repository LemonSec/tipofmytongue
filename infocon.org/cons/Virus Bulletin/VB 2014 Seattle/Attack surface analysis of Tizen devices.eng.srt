1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
now let's continue with the program and

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,339
actually I'm being always interested in

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:11,849
in wearable devices and also Tizen is of

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:13,500
course also providing something like

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,570
that so I've been looking really forward

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,600
to this presentation that's welcome

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,510
orphan as there are over here and let's

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,939
see what this presentation is going to

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,830
be about thank you very appreciate that

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,330
that's a really great introduction and

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,890
thank you all for coming to my

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,320
presentation my name is our fantasy art

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,110
I am with the Intel security group also

14
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,680
known as McAfee as you can see the

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,390
mcafee logo so there it's on my shirt as

16
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,850
well so this is the agenda for today but

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,620
i just wanted to also call out the goal

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,000
that I have here I wanted to give you

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,610
guys enough information about Tizen as a

20
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,090
platform how to look for files that are

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,620
related to tyson how to analyze them and

22
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,809
make you dangerous enough so that if you

23
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,270
come across a threat for that platform

24
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,579
you would know what to do and you

25
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,200
recognize it so that is my goal here ok

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,510
so kaisan and that this is always the

27
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,060
biggest pronunciation is tyson is eddie

28
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,630
correctly pointed out and it's not tease

29
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,790
on but it it is something that we get a

30
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,040
lot of people asking questions about is

31
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,920
a linux-based operating system for

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,530
devices including smartphones tablets in

33
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,900
vehicle information systems devices

34
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,040
smart tvs laptops smart cameras so the

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,850
reason for that is this guy so Tyson is

36
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,740
a collaboration of Intel and Samsung but

37
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,020
because Samsung is so big on the

38
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,450
consumer electronics space they wanted

39
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,090
to have a platform to to basically

40
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,649
consolidate all their electronic devices

41
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,140
and in the direction in you know in the

42
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,970
direction we're headed where a lot of

43
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,250
devices in this day and age of the

44
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,430
internet of things are you know they

45
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,140
have we have the neat for one device to

46
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,210
talk to another device this was the

47
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,399
perfect platform for this is the perfect

48
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,680
time for Santa to launch a new operating

49
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,799
system

50
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,080
so as Eddie pointed out it's it's not

51
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,810
just a mobile operating system it's

52
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,210
actually because of circumstances that

53
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,150
arose Taizo was originally supposed to

54
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,330
be launched on a smartphone do you do

55
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,620
some complications that did not happen

56
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,860
it will happen I believe end of november

57
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,920
the first target market is india and

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,960
right now it exists you can actually go

59
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,940
by devices that actually have the Tizen

60
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,220
operating system it's the NX 3,000

61
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,350
camera the Galaxy gear s this will be

62
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,660
sold I think starting next month from

63
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,190
what I've just been told if this

64
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,060
actually has a 3 it has a data modem 3G

65
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,650
device so it's actually standalone

66
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,740
smartphone / wearable device and the

67
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,720
smartphone and the the samsung TV

68
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,580
operating system will be replaced with

69
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:03,780
tyson so it's out there right now and

70
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,950
it's it's something that you guys can

71
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,180
actually take a look and get your hands

72
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,910
on you get start investigating now so

73
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,850
the origins of tyson go back to 2008

74
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,620
where there's roughly about five

75
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,810
platforms here but the liebo which is

76
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,920
linux mobile that samsung was originally

77
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,239
using and planning to replace their

78
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,150
feature phones with and there's moblin

79
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,340
which stands for mobile linux see the

80
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,930
connection that linux mobile mobile naas

81
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,400
and then there is MIMO which was

82
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,930
supposed to be the successor to the

83
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,660
symbian operating system from Nokia so

84
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,840
you know because there's so much you

85
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,060
know similarity between these guys they

86
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,860
were both they were all literally just

87
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,930
layered operating systems built around

88
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,030
the Linux kernel so it just made perfect

89
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,040
sense for these guys to merge with these

90
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,900
guys come up with a Mego operating

91
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,810
system around that same time in 2009

92
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,300
Samsung decided to keep this project

93
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,100
going but they decided to come up with a

94
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,900
new consumable version of an operating

95
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,750
system to replace the operating system

96
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,660
on feature phones called bada now if you

97
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,239
haven't heard about bada it has not

98
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,060
taken off in North America but it's it

99
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,430
does have success in Korea Samson's

100
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,549
native home market and it's an ecosystem

101
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:17,320
it's got smartphone devices as well as

102
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,260
an app market as well as close to about

103
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,750
four

104
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,150
naps last I checked so to some extent it

105
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,490
was successful so Samson wanted to keep

106
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,960
this guy going and it was you know to

107
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,890
their credit the dibadda app ecosystem

108
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,380
was never violated with a malware which

109
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,110
you know let's just face it even Apple

110
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,720
iTunes or Google Play can't take as a

111
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,270
credit so so they want to maybe set

112
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,650
something that was really interesting

113
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,020
they wanted to keep that going so that's

114
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,740
where Tizen came from 2011 a lot of

115
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,510
these guys decided you know this is

116
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,940
exactly what we want to consolidate take

117
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,350
the attack surfaces of these different

118
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,419
operating systems bring the best of

119
00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:00,440
breed practices and Tyson was born so

120
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,250
since 2011 till today this is where

121
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,310
Tizen stands the first vulnerability for

122
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,790
Tizen was in January first of 2013 20 12

123
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,570
64 it was basically a little issue that

124
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,890
was discovered on the devil's where

125
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,240
despite the fact that you turned off the

126
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,510
Bluetooth setting on the on the dead

127
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,140
phone it really didn't turn off and

128
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,430
unfortunately any device around you

129
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,900
anybody who was wardriving something

130
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,950
that could pick up the thing but then

131
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,150
again it was a depth what I was never

132
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,460
ever meant to be in production so it

133
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,710
wasn't such a big vulnerability the

134
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,990
biggest change after that at this point

135
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,890
in time app developers were encouraged

136
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:50,450
by Samsung and Intel to look at Tizen as

137
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:55,700
the platform for web app development the

138
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,180
the html5 platform was something that

139
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,040
Samsung and both Intel were heavily

140
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,690
promoting and they said this is what you

141
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,160
want to if you are planning to be in

142
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,270
this space you want to leverage your

143
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,580
html5 skills your web app development

144
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,830
skills and you want to make a profit

145
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,330
about it this is the platform you want

146
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,080
to do it and it's pretty reasonable idea

147
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,190
if you think about it because not only

148
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,190
are you exposed to smartphone app

149
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,690
developer but you will also be able to

150
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,970
extend that app experience if you're a

151
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,260
developer to to other platforms so

152
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:32,750
so in 2013 basically actually let's go

153
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,710
back for a second here so bad as I said

154
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,150
you had some good characteristics the

155
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,490
the underlying runtime in the bada

156
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,440
framework was actually poured it over to

157
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,530
the Tizen platform so for the first time

158
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,220
in addition to web apps Tyson also had

159
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,550
the ability to run native apps and the

160
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,720
one thing that was really really big

161
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,630
point for samsung to for developers was

162
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,760
the fact that native apps and web apps

163
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,380
are both first-class citizens they would

164
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,870
be known or capabilities or API calls

165
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,640
between the two so if you're a hardcore

166
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,580
c developer you want to basically

167
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,770
develop what your apps and give people

168
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,380
you know that experience on your native

169
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,720
runtime oh then you can actually do that

170
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,610
or if your web developer you want to

171
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,570
call api set or you know that are not

172
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,580
possible of that so there's no

173
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,900
restriction essentially so 2014 is when

174
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,390
the first phone will be launching

175
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,470
hopefully knock on wood it will be in

176
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,730
november sometime and that's when we

177
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,890
also kind of expect the App Store to be

178
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:42,680
launched so this is the architecture if

179
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,600
anybody has ever seen any of Dan

180
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,280
Bronstein's presentations about the

181
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,440
Tizen architect the Android architecture

182
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,090
the dalek framework and stuff later

183
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,170
you'll see that there's a lot of

184
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,490
similarities and that's the first thing

185
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,710
people ask me like is this a ripoff and

186
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,470
it's the same thing essentially again

187
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,240
the key concept beer it's a layered

188
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,240
operating system built on the colonel a

189
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,340
linux kernel and then the different

190
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,260
layers actually are depending what

191
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,120
device you're using if it's it's a

192
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,060
smartphone it's a vehicle it's a camera

193
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,830
the different layers would be there and

194
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,990
the three most common layers is of

195
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,640
course the the core system framework

196
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,950
which has all these you know the app

197
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,720
frame with the system based connectivity

198
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,790
the services that are provided by the

199
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,410
device you are and this is dependent on

200
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,050
the device you're using then of course

201
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,150
you have the web framework providing the

202
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,130
runtimes the framework to run the apps

203
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,419
either if you're developing a native or

204
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,468
or web

205
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:43,059
so Tizen runtime packages a package in

206
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,610
Tizen is nothing wonder the container or

207
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,190
executable content essentially now each

208
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,529
package has a unique package ID and

209
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:55,300
within each app and within each package

210
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,579
you can have multiple apps now each one

211
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,790
of them has to have a unique app ID as

212
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,230
well as the app name the app name can

213
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,209
overlap but the ID a PI D has to be

214
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:08,529
unique all apps in a package share

215
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:10,690
resources of those the privilege defined

216
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,160
at the package level so you can have

217
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,050
multiple apps within a package but they

218
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,660
all have to have they all or to have to

219
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,279
work off of the privileges divine of the

220
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,579
core app level Tyson framework supports

221
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:24,490
three type of packages web packages

222
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,209
sorry web applications native apps

223
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:29,200
hybrid apps which is a mixture of

224
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,630
actually web apps and native and it also

225
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,430
supports the installation of RPM

226
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,220
packages and the RPM package the mode I

227
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,640
put in there is that despite the fact

228
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,380
that web applications and native

229
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,850
applications require you to explicitly

230
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,899
sign the application for insulation our

231
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:48,910
PM packages don't I consider to be a

232
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,920
security issue and the guys that ties in

233
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,930
they also kind of yeah yeah we think it

234
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,459
is they're also going to change this in

235
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:59,770
the next release so a web application is

236
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,010
based on the w3c widget packaging

237
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,500
specification which is exactly how the

238
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,360
the Firefox OS is dealing with packages

239
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,880
as well and all the apps on Firefox

240
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,589
think they can easily be ported over to

241
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:17,079
ties it without too much trouble you

242
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:19,829
know it's html5 again as the core

243
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:22,270
development engine engine there as well

244
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,790
as the framework people are asked to

245
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,250
develop their apps around a web

246
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,779
application must conform to the

247
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:30,459
following it has to be a zip archived

248
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:34,029
and the extension will be wgt so

249
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:35,980
if you ever see this it's either Firefox

250
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,750
app or it's a ties a nap and this is

251
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,360
what it looks like so the app idea again

252
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,860
I said the app ID has to be unique it's

253
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,399
a ten bite long string it's about four

254
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,560
levels down if you

255
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,900
unzip the file and then when you do you

256
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,850
know you can see the entire content so

257
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,300
reverse engineering or getting this to

258
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,650
getting a black box system running to

259
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,200
basically get the outputs of a web app

260
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:09,790
or very it's not trivial at all hybrid

261
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,440
and native applications must conform to

262
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,880
the following convention again it has to

263
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,180
be a zip archive the the extension in

264
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,270
that case is tpk that's the file

265
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,640
extension for native applications the

266
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,320
package structure looks like this it's a

267
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,540
it's a it's encompassing of the web

268
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,380
application as well as what what is used

269
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,779
to store the the elf binary so having

270
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:39,820
said that if you're if you have any

271
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,390
skills on the symbian platform you know

272
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:47,410
basically decompiling arm binaries your

273
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,120
unlock your skill sets can be users

274
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,080
we're easy to give you compile and debug

275
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,250
elf minor either because they really are

276
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,830
just self binaries and that's where they

277
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:01,600
are stored so applications security and

278
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,510
access control overview so at the core

279
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,180
of the Tizen security enforcement policy

280
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,120
it's privileged control and application

281
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,280
signing both of this you know taken from

282
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,020
vessel you practice from Android and

283
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,540
Apple which includes process I

284
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,000
installation sandboxing and mandatory

285
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,940
access control this is called smack I'll

286
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,190
talk about this in a minute so some of

287
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,770
the key principles that Tizen uses is

288
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:32,500
all applications will run with the non

289
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,270
root user ID including system damon's so

290
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,850
nothing on a Tizen device maybe

291
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,980
smartphone camera or anything else

292
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,780
should be running this and there's one

293
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,760
or two exception but they're bugs and

294
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,890
the guys that ties in are working on

295
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,570
bringing this down and again it's

296
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,150
because of the the consolidation from

297
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,170
the you know

298
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,660
it's because of the consolidation will

299
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,399
break here getting all of these guys to

300
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,320
be nice to each other and talk to each

301
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,300
other and getting you know the best of

302
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,300
breed practices you're here is not easy

303
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:18,279
so okay so an application again in the

304
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,769
sandbox world an application is only

305
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:22,510
allowed to read and write files in its

306
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,670
home directory and shared media

307
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,709
directory that's it you can't access

308
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:29,860
anything else and if you do it's it's

309
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,690
basically because you either rooted the

310
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,550
device or you've somehow i exploited or

311
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,959
broken the sandbox privileges now closes

312
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:39,910
are very similar to the concept of

313
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,209
permissions in android with what little

314
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:44,709
difference and we'll call that in a

315
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:47,200
second here tyson provides api level

316
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,870
access control for sensitive operations

317
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,070
and so essentially what it does is all

318
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,790
the api's have been separated or grouped

319
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,399
actually clustered depending on their

320
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,360
security attack surface so you can have

321
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,790
access to some of them depending on who

322
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,209
you are so if you're a plat for a

323
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:08,500
general public just one-off developer

324
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,870
you can access only a subset of the

325
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,540
entire API set same thing if you're a

326
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,570
partner you get to access more api's

327
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,709
platform is the ultimate you basically

328
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:20,050
ties in or the carrier you make Sovine

329
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,720
access all the AP is and it's similar to

330
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,209
the concept of how system permissions

331
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:27,250
are used on Android wear certain apps

332
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,620
can only access certain AP is used by

333
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,140
the system if they're signed by the

334
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,740
system signature application without

335
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,500
proper privileges cannot use the api's

336
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,730
doesn't matter you have the permissions

337
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,120
it's dependent on the signature and the

338
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,170
other thing that's interesting about

339
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,890
ties in application is that whereas on

340
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,470
Android you require one signature on

341
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,350
Tizen there are two and again it doesn't

342
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,730
mentioned before depending on the

343
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,360
signature that you have that is the

344
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,769
essentially determines what is the

345
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:01,930
probability API proposes that you can

346
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,540
access so an author signature is

347
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,000
basically the author and that has to be

348
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,529
registered with the types of development

349
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:09,699
certificate authority which is the

350
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:10,300
tysons

351
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,750
or and the distributor signature this is

352
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,850
generated by the the Tizen Association

353
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,670
of the Tizen store and is usually only

354
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,190
assigned to say large carriers or

355
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,940
somebody who samsung trusts enough to to

356
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,430
basically allow them to either develop

357
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,610
the platform or extend it or you know

358
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,460
somebody who is in need of special api's

359
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,110
or something like mobile like actual

360
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:39,630
cars the in-vehicle entertainment system

361
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,730
so here's an example of the API that

362
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,500
I've got this documented in the paper

363
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,540
that gives you a list of all the APS for

364
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,120
example I don't know if you can see that

365
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,710
the app certificate I believe that's

366
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,330
what it says can only be accessed by the

367
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:56,920
partner signature same thing with things

368
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,520
like see let's take a look at your

369
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,170
bookmarks and stuff can only be accessed

370
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,870
by platform and stuff that you know we

371
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,550
take write it on Android for example

372
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,140
changing a system setting that can only

373
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,710
be done by platform so you know if your

374
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,120
malicious app you try to uninstall a

375
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,310
security application unless you have a

376
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,480
partner signature that's not going to

377
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,450
happen so the other thing different in

378
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:27,300
the Tizen you know security model is

379
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,590
it's something that Android actually try

380
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:33,160
to adopt with a pops but for one reason

381
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,540
or the other they decided not to go

382
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,400
ahead with it is that you can define

383
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,740
permissions post installations on the

384
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,190
app by the user so in android unites is

385
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,620
a policy of all or nothing so you have

386
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,110
an app that's requiring SMS privileges

387
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,210
or or I don't know connection to the

388
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,590
internet but you're not comfortable with

389
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,690
that app talking to the internet for

390
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,910
some reason or if you don't want it to

391
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,890
be you know somehow accessing your

392
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,450
contact database you can't do anything

393
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,310
about it the only choices you uninstall

394
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:05,680
the app but on Tizen by default what you

395
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,780
can do is you can basically take that

396
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,790
granular permission level and say you

397
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,680
know what I don't want this app after

398
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,200
installation accessing my contacts

399
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,540
databases anymore or I don't want it

400
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,130
accessing my location information

401
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,579
anymore now the problem you're and the

402
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,410
trick here is that app developers have

403
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:23,859
to keep

404
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:26,049
in mind that this is happening in the

405
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:27,760
background and this is this is something

406
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,590
that the user has an option so they have

407
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,660
to come up with error checking routines

408
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,000
on their own the system won't tell you

409
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,429
if somebody's disabled it so your app is

410
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:38,740
basically prone to crash if it's not

411
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,750
which is one of the reasons why a pops

412
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:49,470
wasn't officially launched now smack is

413
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,690
a Linux security module that determines

414
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,000
the process how processes interact with

415
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,340
each other and share information in a

416
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,860
nutshell this is how Tyson basically

417
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,880
achieves sandboxing so the key concept

418
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,559
here if if there are two entities and

419
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:06,940
they want to communicate with each other

420
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,040
they need to have one of these labels

421
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,530
that basically identifies for each of

422
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,340
those objects you going to have a

423
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,040
labeled so for example I have a label

424
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,960
that says I could talk to her and she

425
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,549
has a label that she can talk to me and

426
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:20,620
you can get more granular on that and

427
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,980
you can say between 6pm and 6pm and you

428
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,299
know you can restrict it more so that

429
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:28,809
that is essentially the court here that

430
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:31,770
is driving smack and the entire thing

431
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,140
compared to like to say selinux is

432
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,370
simplicity is the goal that we're going

433
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,250
for you know I think somebody was

434
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,070
something like selinux was rejected

435
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,059
because of that over smack and of course

436
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,790
smack is part of the Linux upstream so

437
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,280
every app has its own label which also

438
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,740
can be used as a way to identify the app

439
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,160
in addition to the app ID and Tyson's

440
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,830
uses these smacks labels to control apps

441
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,790
API devices functions and everything so

442
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,850
basically not only our apps restricted

443
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,280
by snap smack on what they can do when

444
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,049
they communicate you can actually create

445
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,140
smack policies around two components

446
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,929
within a Tizen device and how they

447
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:21,340
communicate and how they interact so

448
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,650
content security framework now this is

449
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,290
mcafee or intel security groups

450
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,620
contribution to the Tizen ecosystem now

451
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,890
that this is a vendor agnostic framework

452
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,860
you know what we realized here and

453
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,780
you know it was based on experience of

454
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,890
Android that sandbox operating system

455
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:42,940
they don't make it easy for a new

456
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,750
vendors to do what they need to do so it

457
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,030
would be ideal to have a platform or a

458
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,070
layer to work off of which actually

459
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,799
exposes hooks so that you can basically

460
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:56,170
you know if you find something malicious

461
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,340
or if you're planning to write your own

462
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,670
engines to scan files or scan URLs you

463
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,240
would have the ability to to basically

464
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,740
not worried about how would you actually

465
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,480
remove the app and subletter you focus

466
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,070
on what you need to do which is write

467
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,230
the code for the engine and that's it

468
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,350
and that's what semantics I'm sorry well

469
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,450
that's what say a couple of other

470
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,830
companies like this paresky they're also

471
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:21,730
doing and there's right now to vendors

472
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,830
actually who are actually if i'm not

473
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,620
mistaken will be there available as a

474
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,950
download on the Tison app store when it

475
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,190
launches which is mcafee and kaspersky

476
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,540
so you know that's the other hidden

477
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,190
agenda I have here which is to get you

478
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,630
guys interested in the content security

479
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,720
framework enough to to identify that you

480
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,730
know what you can maybe reduce your time

481
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,980
to market by using this and again it's

482
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,020
open source we have very little control

483
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,419
over this other than than you know maybe

484
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:51,400
helping you guys have a documentation I

485
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:57,030
write your own engines to hook onto this

486
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,929
okay so let's face it phones are nothing

487
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:03,520
without their app ecosystem in this day

488
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,040
and age right so the apple ecosystem in

489
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,080
this case is represented by the Tizen

490
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,780
store again we're hoping that it's going

491
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,610
to be launching around November that's

492
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,419
what the tysons or guys were telling me

493
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,470
now this isn't something that they told

494
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,730
me what we actually figured this out on

495
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,110
our own which is we looked at a couple

496
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,690
of available Tizen phones that was being

497
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,120
demoed at the Tizen developer conference

498
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,500
in i believe it was in june or May in

499
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,780
San Francisco we went over there we kind

500
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,340
of started looking through the device

501
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,660
and seeing how many apps are available

502
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,580
in the App Store so we're roughly the

503
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,179
ecosystems around 10,000 apps or less

504
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:42,280
and there's only about two devices where

505
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,660
I believe that will be launched so

506
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,220
you're looking at looking at initially

507
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,040
an ecosystem of 10,000 apps and

508
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,500
increasing and there's roughly about 200

509
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,120
apps for the Tizen version of the

510
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,690
wearable device so it's not a you know

511
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,040
if you're looking to get into a new

512
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,390
operation this is the perfect time to do

513
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:05,080
it so how do you ask get on the Tizen

514
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,180
app store they go through an app

515
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,250
validation process which consists of two

516
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,060
phases now after a nap as a developer

517
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,820
has been submitted to the Tizen store

518
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,100
what the first phase does is basically

519
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,240
run an inspection automated dynamic

520
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,550
glasses it's it's based off of emulators

521
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,230
and there's actually quite a lot of

522
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,690
documentation on this and what they do

523
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,130
is they literally just run your app and

524
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,660
I'm live emulator and they basically see

525
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,730
what are the inputs and outputs they try

526
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,490
to simulate interactions with the app to

527
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,370
see if there's certain functionalities

528
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,040
that will trigger some more inputs or

529
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,340
outputs and based on that they basically

530
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,530
give it a pass or fail if it's been

531
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,690
flagged it goes here I mean all apps go

532
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,190
to hear any of it but it goes that into

533
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,750
the extra note saying look there's

534
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,310
something that flag to phase one you may

535
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,540
want to take an extra look at it in

536
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,680
phase 2 phase two is human in static

537
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,990
analysis that this is something Samsung

538
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,640
and said that they are going to do so it

539
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,990
goes through an automation as well as a

540
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,400
human inspection process and the best

541
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,620
part Tyson has said this is the part

542
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,570
that always causes a little bit of a

543
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,460
concern samsung said that they'll turn

544
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,730
around any app submitted to them within

545
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,590
three days maximum so this entire

546
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,600
process you can send in thousands of

547
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,000
apps three days that's a turnaround time

548
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,530
now again like I said Bardock to its

549
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,690
credit some of the guys behind us are

550
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,940
the same people using the you know who

551
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,410
were behind the bada project in the app

552
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,830
store bought it to its credit we have

553
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,320
never heard or seen any malware on it so

554
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,790
you know I'll give them the benefit of

555
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,320
the doubt maybe they can pull it off but

556
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,830
if the app ecosystem explodes you get

557
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,050
thousands of developers come here you

558
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,400
know I'm not sure of that three-day time

559
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,450
period will hold so against a little bit

560
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,710
more detail about what happens during

561
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,500
those three days the app is analyzed

562
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,530
this actually the opposite so the

563
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,570
dynamic analysis basically brings back

564
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,640
instrumentation of what were the URLs

565
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,700
being contacted you know they have a

566
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,300
reputation on them and they're using a

567
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,160
they're using an array of AV engines as

568
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,860
well so it they try to figure out if

569
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,360
there's any detection on this from any

570
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,950
standard equipment of anything ancient

571
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,780
and when it passes through both of these

572
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,170
things then it gets analysis done to

573
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,730
basically confirm that the permissions

574
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,480
that are being asked for by the app are

575
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,950
the bare minimum of what the app needs

576
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,410
so if it's a nap I don't know just that

577
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,510
doesn't require certain permissions they

578
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,490
will stop that app from being published

579
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,160
it will ask for an explanation from the

580
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,360
developer why do you need this

581
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,470
permission you don't need it for this

582
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,470
app and after that it gets on the Tizen

583
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,100
store so the revaluation occurs when the

584
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,660
app has been updated again that same

585
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,580
process continues from this point

586
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:03,830
onwards okay third party stores as I

587
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,930
said that there's there's two signatures

588
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,570
so we are Samsung has been a little bit

589
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,460
quiet about this but we are expecting

590
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,840
them to facilitate basically third party

591
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:21,020
stores it's in around the world so we do

592
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,470
believe there will be third party stores

593
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,720
but what we still don't know about is if

594
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,070
sideloading will be not allowed

595
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,930
sideloading right now is allowed on the

596
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,460
developer devices as well as on the

597
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,560
phones but we don't know what the final

598
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,570
release product will have right now

599
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,370
there's like a half a dozen places where

600
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,350
you can find people who were kind of

601
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,410
anxious to get their develop apps out

602
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,330
and distribute its Emma so you'll find a

603
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,240
lot of you know stuff on github a lot of

604
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,400
third-party sites where you can actually

605
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,690
download apps and and basically you know

606
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:00,200
investigate them so ties it under attack

607
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,300
now this is the part that I like about

608
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,980
the presentation the most so as I

609
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,870
mentioned this operating system is right

610
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,530
now out there on wearable devices on

611
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:11,660
cameras in vehicles as the other part of

612
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,119
forgot to mention Jaguar and Toyota

613
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:16,639
at both signed on and you know they it

614
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:17,779
makes sense if you think about it right

615
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:19,219
there a vehicle company they don't want

616
00:26:19,219 --> 00:26:20,689
to be in the operating system business

617
00:26:20,689 --> 00:26:22,369
they would rather leave it to somebody

618
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:23,989
who's got experience in this which is

619
00:26:23,989 --> 00:26:26,269
you know makes perfect sense a

620
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:29,119
consumable electronic company to focus

621
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:31,939
on creating the the value as far as in

622
00:26:31,939 --> 00:26:36,139
vehicle entertainment goes so there's

623
00:26:36,139 --> 00:26:38,779
this was the first one durability that

624
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:41,899
was discussed in the Bluetooth con man

625
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:44,329
functionality after you turn the

626
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:46,849
bluetooth outfit wasn't there it didn't

627
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:49,519
turn off here's another one the camera

628
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,599
the NX 3000 it comes with the you know

629
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:55,489
caga reader and writer and by default

630
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,679
there's about several guys out there

631
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,999
who've been you know playing around with

632
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:01,099
it try to customize the OSI try and see

633
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:04,519
look for vulnerabilities so one there's

634
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:05,689
there's one gentleman out there what he

635
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:07,189
did was he basically found out that the

636
00:27:07,189 --> 00:27:11,779
the tag the device was rewritable so the

637
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:13,339
functionality was you've got a camera

638
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:15,739
you basically any kind of Android device

639
00:27:15,739 --> 00:27:18,349
you touch it against the camera and to

640
00:27:18,349 --> 00:27:21,109
create a positive user experience if the

641
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:22,819
camera has an NFC reader you'll be able

642
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:26,029
to directly download the app from

643
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:28,759
Samsung to interact with the camera you

644
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:29,659
know so you don't have to worry about

645
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:31,399
setting up Wi-Fi setting out what's the

646
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,379
SSID setting of the Bluetooth connection

647
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:35,419
you don't have to worry about that but

648
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:37,489
what they were also realized was you can

649
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,629
actually change that to something else

650
00:27:38,629 --> 00:27:40,789
so instead of going to Google Play you

651
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:42,049
can actually redirect that to any

652
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:44,059
package on google play that was that was

653
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:45,859
something very easily changed and there

654
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:47,299
was no signature verification or

655
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,099
anything I needed to be done to redirect

656
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:53,449
this thing so you know the other thing

657
00:27:53,449 --> 00:27:55,489
is that the the tag supports permanent

658
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:57,169
right locking so if you decided to

659
00:27:57,169 --> 00:28:00,289
create a custom OS and distribute it you

660
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:02,329
know like i said the RPM packages they

661
00:28:02,329 --> 00:28:03,829
don't have to be signed and they're not

662
00:28:03,829 --> 00:28:05,659
verified on a device so you can you can

663
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:07,959
be installing a malicious RPM package

664
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:11,479
with you know in the perception that

665
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:14,569
it's a clean contribution to the open

666
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:19,069
source community so so here's another

667
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:20,989
example somebody actually decided to

668
00:28:20,989 --> 00:28:22,759
take one of the cameras and do a you

669
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:23,160
know

670
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,810
nmap scan and they actually found out

671
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,180
that the port is open sure if you can

672
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,220
see that they're 4x11 right there 6000

673
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,200
so you know what you can do was it was a

674
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,280
little minute what you can do you I mean

675
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,510
they they kind of did ended up sending a

676
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,210
couple of images to the device the other

677
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,620
thing was that you could also do a DDoS

678
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,430
attack and take out a camera but again

679
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,570
one of the things that you want to keep

680
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,860
an eye on so the other thing that was

681
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,180
you know something that one of a

682
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,740
gentleman who I worked with a couple of

683
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,020
years ago Candace actually found out was

684
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:00,810
that ties and devices can be routed they

685
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,060
you know this is so that if anybody's

686
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,700
looking for additional customization

687
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,140
example to watch you know they're not

688
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,210
happy with the the fact that in certain

689
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,850
regions like in Japan where it is

690
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,340
mandatory for mobile recording devices

691
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,430
to have an audible alarm you know you

692
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,470
can basically root the device and

693
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,420
basically disable the alarm which is

694
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,560
again kind of breaking a lot but

695
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,710
customizing it and there's roughly about

696
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:29,730
two currently available rude exploits

697
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:34,160
that can give you rude access on Tyson

698
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,810
person ok could you roll please

699
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,900
absolutely really there ok so the last

700
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,690
thing one of the things that is of

701
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,460
course a sign that the ecosystem is

702
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,920
under attack malware we've started to

703
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,410
see posts on sites and where we're

704
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,470
actively trying to chase down these guys

705
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:54,620
where they've actually call that spyware

706
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:59,790
claiming that it is available on Tizen

707
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,890
devices again the device has not been

708
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,690
released so what we suspect is they

709
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,610
probably attended a developer conference

710
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,870
or are probably using something off of

711
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,690
the emulator to get these abs so you

712
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:12,270
know we I don't believe I think it

713
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,760
wouldn't be too much of a stretch to say

714
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,040
that before the year is out we can

715
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,840
expect to see the first tizen malware

716
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,740
out there that's it

717
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,800
you
