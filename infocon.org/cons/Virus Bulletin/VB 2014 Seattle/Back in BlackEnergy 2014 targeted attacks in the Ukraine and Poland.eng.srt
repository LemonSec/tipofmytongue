1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
better yeah I think that's better okay

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,510
so we'll be talking about black energy

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,100
which we've been looking at for the past

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,069
few months the two many reasons why this

5
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:10,260
malware and these cases caught our

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,719
attention is because firstly it's an

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,030
interesting example of an old malware

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,220
family that's been reused for several

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,359
different purposes throughout its

10
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,300
evolution throughout the lifetime and

11
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,740
also some of the campaign's detected

12
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,630
this year we're using the conflict in

13
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,760
eastern Ukraine as fuel for its

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,390
spreading the tale of black energy

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,420
probably started sometime around 2007

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,520
back then it was a relatively simple

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,610
trojan used for denial of service

18
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,730
attacks and Arbour networks actually

19
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,190
published a white paper on this then

20
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,530
version 2 saw the light of day sometime

21
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,570
in 2010 and it was a complete code

22
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,340
rewrite it became a pretty serious and

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,379
sophisticated malware with module

24
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,180
architecture being able to expand the

25
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,579
functionality and this time it was not

26
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,949
only being used for DDoSing but also for

27
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,260
bank fraud and spam fast forward fast

28
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,659
forward to the present day to 2014 and

29
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,909
we're still seeing black energy alive

30
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,640
and kicking and were we're seeing it

31
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,030
used in targeted attacks now were using

32
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,790
an evolution we're seeing an evolution

33
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,470
of the regular black energy kinds and

34
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,240
also something new which we nicknamed

35
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,799
black energy light but I'll get to that

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,350
in just a second

37
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,670
like other complex malware black energy

38
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,970
consists of several components let's

39
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,680
take a look at the evolution throughout

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,710
its lifetime let's to take a look at the

41
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,409
purposes of the driver in version 2 in

42
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,810
2010 the driver also contained rootkit

43
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,759
functionality so it was hiding stuff on

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,579
the system preferred some SS DT hooks to

45
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,119
accomplish that then in the 2014 the

46
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,280
regular black and entry versions they

47
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,640
also contain a driver but it's no longer

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,070
has rootkit functionality so the drivers

49
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,750
sole purpose appears to be just to

50
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,390
inject the main DLL into user lamp

51
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,790
processes more specifically into

52
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,969
svchost.exe and then the light variant

53
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:08,250
which I mentioned it goes even a step

54
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,919
further in not using a driver at all

55
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,900
instead it loads the diella

56
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,010
you know let's say more polite

57
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,709
or standard way simply about by loading

58
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:19,769
it through run DLL 32x II such

59
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:21,780
simplification appears to be a trend in

60
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,810
malware nowadays so the trends which

61
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,030
were among the highest ranks in malware

62
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,950
in terms of sophistication rootkit boot

63
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,370
kits

64
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,640
ruse Stockholm ret DL 3 for Rob Nix and

65
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,730
others are not as common nowadays as

66
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,879
they used to be we can discuss the

67
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,590
possible reasons for that later if you

68
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:47,370
want obviously the main purpose of any

69
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,079
malware dropper is to drop other

70
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:51,989
components in black energies case it

71
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:54,660
drops and loads the driver we're talking

72
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,420
about the regular black energy now and

73
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,720
it does so by enumerate all drivers that

74
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,150
are already installed in the system but

75
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,250
disabled it randomly selects one

76
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,829
replaces it with its own malicious

77
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:10,019
driver and attempts to start it and it

78
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,079
also does a couple of interesting tricks

79
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:15,420
and now as you all know on 64 between

80
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,970
versions of Windows the drivers need to

81
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,099
have valid digital signatures in order

82
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,069
to bypass this security feature black

83
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,840
energy modifies the system's boot

84
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,669
configuration data to allow testing

85
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:30,239
signatures now such modification or such

86
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,700
setting should trigger a notification

87
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,410
near the system tray such as this one

88
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,829
and in order to hide that one and stay

89
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:40,889
under the radar black energy will patch

90
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:44,400
the user 32 DLL Mui which is part of the

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,230
multilingual user interface so these

92
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,690
files they contain the translations of

93
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,419
all sorts of Windows text for all the

94
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:52,889
languages which are installed in Windows

95
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:57,209
and so what black energy does it it

96
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:00,599
simply black blanks out these text so

97
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,180
they're not visible also another trick

98
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,109
it bypasses or make sure that the UAC

99
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:09,690
prompt is in does it doesn't show up

100
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,790
through a shim database which is carries

101
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,440
with itself so it uses the Microsoft

102
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,579
application compatibility toolkit to

103
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,829
achieve that it does it doesn't do any

104
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,478
escalation of privileges though so it

105
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:22,770
needs to be running under administrator

106
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,060
account the funny thing is though that

107
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,430
it elevates it gets the higher

108
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,320
possible privileges that it can get and

109
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,690
shims are the official way of doing that

110
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,870
so they're the official way of achieving

111
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,660
this task now at the beginning of this

112
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,750
year we spotted a blackberry black

113
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,880
energy sorry modification which we

114
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,250
nicknamed black energy light or mini

115
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,020
I'll be using those names both of them

116
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,240
throughout the presentation mainly due

117
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,370
to the absence of kernel mode driver a

118
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,560
lesser support of plugins and an overall

119
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,570
lighter footprint now this was not just

120
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,539
a minor version update the changes they

121
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:05,770
were very significant here you can see

122
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,220
for example the different format of the

123
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,460
build IDs on the left a selection of

124
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,590
light variants on the right a couple of

125
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,720
big black energy versions now is anybody

126
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,990
able to spot a trend here is anybody

127
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,970
able to interpret these version IDs

128
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,870
version numbers for the big black energy

129
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,690
they could be okay let me let me give it

130
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,720
away the basically time stamp so d13

131
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,449
these samples were built at the end of

132
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:43,060
last year then the other ones are from

133
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,419
this year 2014 there's February May June

134
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:49,990
and more recent ones from this month now

135
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,300
note that both the black energy light

136
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,900
variants and big variants are being

137
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,979
actively developed and they're being

138
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:59,710
actively used and in some cases we have

139
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,930
seen that in attacks they're being also

140
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,970
used in tandem also an interesting

141
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,340
difference between black energy lights

142
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,270
and the regular big black energy is how

143
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,380
it stores its configuration data the

144
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,090
regular black and red energy stores it

145
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,720
stores it as in the form of XML files

146
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,810
whereas black energy light stores is in

147
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,870
an x.509 certificate which is kind of

148
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,720
unique and it uses a crypto API to parse

149
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,020
this configuration data also there's a

150
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,060
different plug-in interface different

151
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,940
means of communication between the

152
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,940
plugins and the main

153
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,330
DLL so the plugins they're not

154
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,920
compatible in between the different

155
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,330
kinds of black energy variants the light

156
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,850
version communicates through a pipe and

157
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,700
this is the main dll for black energy

158
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,080
light and you can notice that it only

159
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,930
has to export functions may cache and

160
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:09,440
start in contrast in contrast this is

161
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,520
taken from a plugin written for big

162
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,930
black energy and you can see it's

163
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,770
dependent on imports from the main DLL

164
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,140
and it basically loads imports and then

165
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,540
calls these function directly it doesn't

166
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,210
use a pipe so these are not these are

167
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,440
not compatible with one another here is

168
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,390
actually an interesting case sort of a

169
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:37,250
hybrid which we found and it contains

170
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,590
features of both big black energy and

171
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,410
the mini version it doesn't use a driver

172
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,700
it contains some features which we've

173
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,650
attributed to the light versions but it

174
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,340
contains the exports as in the big

175
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,150
version the time stamp is October 2013

176
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,210
so we assume this is the time when the

177
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,430
attackers were starting the development

178
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,550
of these versions and actually we

179
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,830
spotted this hybrid after we gave the

180
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,150
many versions of this nickname and

181
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,460
apparently

182
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,340
the authors also shared also shared this

183
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,720
opinion and basically confirm our

184
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,140
finding in that they are also calling it

185
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:25,070
main light DLL of course the bare

186
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,840
malware would be pretty useless to the

187
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,730
attackers so let's look at the different

188
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,890
plugins we encountered while we were

189
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,780
tracking it

190
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,789
most of the plugins in this list are for

191
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:38,750
big black energy now of course it

192
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,789
wouldn't be a problem at all if the if

193
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:43,280
the attackers wanted to reuse them to

194
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,980
recompile them for the light versions if

195
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,850
they needed to also the functionality in

196
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,330
a number of these plugins overlaps which

197
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,309
is a suggestion that there are

198
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:58,129
many different third parties writing

199
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:00,470
these plugins so let's take a closer

200
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,970
look at some of the more interesting

201
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,889
ones like it's the most important part

202
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:09,709
of every Trojan used for remote access

203
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:12,139
and espionage and data theft is the file

204
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:15,230
is the plugin for or the functionality

205
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,920
for stealing files of the victims drives

206
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,600
black energy of course is no exception

207
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,639
what's interesting is notice this

208
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,970
example command this is actually

209
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,279
executed at the start of the plugin and

210
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,220
you can notice what kind of files the

211
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,869
attackers are mainly after so they are

212
00:09:32,869 --> 00:09:37,329
there after documents and private keys

213
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,499
this is the SI plugin which is the only

214
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,850
one which we found for black energy

215
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,619
lights during our tracking of the

216
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,809
botnets as the name suggests it's used

217
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:49,639
to collect all sorts of system

218
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,939
information also some some network

219
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:55,519
related information and also it has the

220
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,300
capability to collect passwords from

221
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,699
various different applications mostly

222
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:06,920
browsers the vs plugin is designed to do

223
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,610
network discovery it can enumerate

224
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,139
resources connected to the network it

225
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:13,929
has the capability to get RDP

226
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:15,649
credentials from the Microsoft

227
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,620
credentials store and then attempt to

228
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,559
connect to them also inside the plugin

229
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:26,019
is PS x''k which is embedded and this

230
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:29,809
this utility is used to again gather

231
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:31,459
system information from the remote

232
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:33,439
computers and is also able to launch

233
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:36,980
execute launch executables on them so

234
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,009
this plugin is part of the reason why

235
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:41,749
it's kind of difficult to remove the

236
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:47,120
infection from an infected lan another

237
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,600
plug-in is used for parasitically

238
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,240
infecting executables now since viruses

239
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,149
are a marginal thing nowadays at least

240
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:57,709
in statistical terms it's always

241
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:59,480
interesting to discover such

242
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,970
functionality in a malware so it does

243
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,029
it's typical viral infection stuff but

244
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:07,160
what's interesting is that not only does

245
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,270
it fix

246
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,830
check some in the PE header but in case

247
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,140
it's infected and no salt installer it

248
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,770
will also fix the crc32 value and also

249
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,200
in order in order to avoid invalidating

250
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,430
digital signatures

251
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:25,610
it simply deletes any the TV plug in or

252
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,940
the TeamViewer plug-in is connected to

253
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,910
this remote control software it checks

254
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,790
if TeamViewer vs versions six seven or

255
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,500
eight are installed version 9 which is

256
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,950
the latest one is not supported in the

257
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,580
versions which we've seen if it's

258
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,990
installed it's it's an additional

259
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,750
password for remote unattended access

260
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,790
thus creating an additional back door

261
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,360
into the compromised system and then

262
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,000
there's also a destroy plug-in this is

263
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,120
an embedded one and the command issued

264
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,670
to this plug-in contains the data and

265
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,890
time and when that reaches when that's

266
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,920
reached they will act as an

267
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,290
self-destruct so we will rewrite files

268
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,660
with these extensions with random data

269
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,410
then it will delete itself then render

270
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,180
the system unbootable by wiping the

271
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,130
first 11 sectors of the system drive and

272
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,680
then it will start a driver to rewrite

273
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,410
all remaining files with random data so

274
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,750
kind of unpleasant for the people who

275
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,350
encounter this

276
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,330
during our monitoring of the botnets

277
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,940
this year we observed over a hundred

278
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,590
individual victims half of them were

279
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,860
situated in Ukraine and approximately a

280
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,440
half in Poland among them was a number

281
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,210
of state organizations various private

282
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,280
businesses as well as targets which we

283
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,570
were unable to identify this is an

284
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,160
example of a configuration from an

285
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,940
attack at a Ukrainian state institution

286
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,430
what's interesting here that you can see

287
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:06,040
the CNC addresses that the that the

288
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,830
black energy infection is trying to

289
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,890
connect to and also it supports proxies

290
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,070
so it contained local proxies on the

291
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,190
local network which means that the

292
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,570
attackers must have had prior knowledge

293
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:24,250
to of the network environment in April

294
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,560
we discovered a document exploiting a CV

295
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,490
2014 1761 vulnerability in Microsoft

296
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,800
Word now this X boy was in the spotlight

297
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,990
earlier this year it was also using

298
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,600
other targeted attacks using other our

299
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,550
families for example mini Duke said need

300
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,520
accession and others I won't go into too

301
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,230
much detail about how this exploit works

302
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,580
since my colleague Sebastian Duquette

303
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,680
will be covering the details on this

304
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,500
exploit and also the targeted attacks in

305
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,970
which it was used in his AVR

306
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,760
presentation in November suffice to say

307
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,640
however that the successful execution of

308
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,080
the payload or of the shell code drops

309
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,260
obviously the black energy dropper and

310
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,870
also displays a decoy document to the

311
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,140
victim now in this case the text of the

312
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,550
decoy document was it was quite a

313
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,650
controversial one because it talks about

314
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,540
Russian ambassador's discussing how

315
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,270
they'll take over Catalonia Venice

316
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,560
Scotland and Alaska after they've

317
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,110
annexed Crimea another decoy document

318
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,690
another case which we found

319
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,280
approximately at the same time the

320
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,230
scenario was pretty much the same in

321
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,860
this case the same exploit was used and

322
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,930
the text was a bit less controversial

323
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,390
but still related to foreign relations

324
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,170
and diplomacy

325
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,250
the subject was glop SEC 2014 the forum

326
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:48,819
held

327
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:53,769
slava this year a month later we found a

328
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,929
file called spy sock parolee this time

329
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,449
it was an executable but it had a word

330
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:01,449
icon which leads to many victims falling

331
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:06,759
for this and opening it and despite

332
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:09,129
being a being executed it also contained

333
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:11,199
an embedded decoy document which was

334
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,419
shown to to the victims and as the name

335
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:18,369
suggests piece of parolee is Ukrainian

336
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:21,249
for password list it did contain a list

337
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:24,579
of passwords this example was also found

338
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:26,350
by our friends at f-secure who wrote a

339
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,869
blog about it and who are also releasing

340
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:32,789
a white paper on black energy in august

341
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:36,549
2014 we know we noticed an interesting

342
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:38,859
case because of the exploit that was

343
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:41,949
used and also because we were able to

344
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:44,169
see the actual email that was being used

345
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:47,379
to spread the malware the email

346
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,389
contained again quite a controversial

347
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:52,989
text for those of you who like me don't

348
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:54,909
speak Ukrainian I'll give you a rough

349
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:57,339
translation Arsenal yatsenuk who is the

350
00:15:57,339 --> 00:15:59,499
prime minister of ukraine instructs the

351
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:02,019
prosecutor general's office the security

352
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:03,639
service of ukraine in the Ministry of

353
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:06,100
Internal Affairs Ministry of Justice to

354
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,869
check all members of parliament parties

355
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:10,479
NGOs in Ukraine for the involvement in

356
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:12,939
the support of rebels in east of Ukraine

357
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:16,229
and then in attachment there's a list of

358
00:16:16,229 --> 00:16:18,789
potential terrorist supporters that

359
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:22,319
should be checked so what happens when

360
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:26,019
the victim or the potential victim opens

361
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,359
the attachment the text of the

362
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:32,889
PowerPoint slideshow corresponds to the

363
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:35,379
text in the email and actually it does

364
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:37,269
contain a list of names

365
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:40,199
I guess alleged probable conspirators

366
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,809
terrorist supporters but what's more

367
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:45,489
important is what's happening on the

368
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:48,479
background as you can probably guess

369
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:52,029
this will eventually lead to the

370
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:54,789
infection installation of black energy

371
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:58,689
light the interesting part is how the

372
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:00,189
power phone package contains two

373
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:02,649
embedded only objects and

374
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:06,789
both of them contain a remote path as to

375
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:09,010
where the resource is located so it's a

376
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,109
feature of PowerPoint to load these

377
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,409
files and it's a dangerous one and

378
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:17,319
Microsoft has actually addressed this

379
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,929
and updated the object package a DLL the

380
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:21,880
module responsible for loading these

381
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,089
over two years ago in m/s 1205 and users

382
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:27,609
should be receiving warnings something

383
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:29,770
like these however no warning is

384
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,960
displayed at all for the PPS X power

385
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,990
point slide show files and we tried all

386
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,669
of these Office PowerPoint versions 2007

387
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:42,340
2010 2013 with all the latest patches

388
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:47,950
installed so combined that lack of

389
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,860
warning with the fact that in as you all

390
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,320
know is an executable extension were

391
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,480
building up a pretty dangerous scenario

392
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,950
so what does our info file do can't see

393
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,110
it very well here but the first step is

394
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,020
that it will rename the downloaded slide

395
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,880
one gif file to slide one gift eggsy of

396
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,370
course it wasn't an image it wasn't

397
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,779
executable and I can tell you that it

398
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:13,299
was the black energy dropper and then it

399
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:15,970
launches it simply by setting this

400
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,100
registry key and then windows takes care

401
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,890
of the rest

402
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,779
now other infection vectors for black

403
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:25,179
energy were put use not just the graphic

404
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:27,760
ones with decoy documents and stuff

405
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,279
remember that parasitic ineffective

406
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,549
plugin so that was also actively used

407
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:37,240
and we've seen infected installers of

408
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,049
Juniper software which were used to

409
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:43,840
spread black energy also other infection

410
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,270
vectors were Java TeamViewer where

411
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,640
infections originated from these

412
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,260
processes so there was probably some

413
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,880
Java exploitation going on but we were

414
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,779
unable to under to identify the specific

415
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:57,640
vulnerability that was targeted and also

416
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,350
TeamViewer perhaps they have used a

417
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,700
plugin such as the TeamViewer plug-in

418
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,169
that I mentioned or they got the

419
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:06,850
TeamViewer credentials some other way

420
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,429
and I'm pretty sure there were other

421
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:11,070
infection vectors that we were unable to

422
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:16,300
identify also the Ukrainian cert knows

423
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,130
about this case and a bunch of other

424
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,520
similar ones now in this research that

425
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,600
I'm talking about right now we were

426
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,850
focusing on black energy however many

427
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,100
similar campaigns have been using other

428
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,890
malware families out there such as is

429
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,530
described in this you a search blog post

430
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,570
so unfortunately this is just the tip of

431
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,380
the iceberg so coming to the end of my

432
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,660
presentation a couple of interesting

433
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,280
facts and easter eggs some of the cncs

434
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,650
used by black energy we're also being

435
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,590
used to run tor relays at some point in

436
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,680
time we also notice an interesting

437
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,610
cultural reference these are this is a

438
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:01,540
selection of some of the black energy c2

439
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,200
server addresses if you take a look at

440
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,260
the directories I hope there's no one in

441
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,130
the audience who can who can interpret

442
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,920
this just by looking at it but I'll help

443
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,890
you with debase with adding the base64

444
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,350
in it and does this ring a bell for

445
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:26,110
anyone yeah I heard it yep doing

446
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,540
references so the attackers are

447
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:35,800
apparently fans so to sum it up black

448
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,070
energy malware family first being used

449
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,170
for DDoS attacks then spam bank fraud

450
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:44,950
and now for stealing data and espionage

451
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,890
there were numerous campaigns in 2014

452
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,560
and many more victims some of these

453
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,560
campaigns have been using CV 2014 1761

454
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,960
for it's spreading and if you're going

455
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,550
to Sydney in November be sure to check

456
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,920
out Sebastian Duke it's presentation on

457
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,520
this subject once he found out that was

458
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,930
pretty this was pretty serious and what

459
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,260
was going on we took a couple of other

460
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,820
additional steps such as contacting the

461
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,980
Ukrainian and polish certs we compose an

462
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,620
indicator of compromise and we're we're

463
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,750
communication with a couple of victims

464
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,720
that were also our customers and we also

465
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,430
reported that PowerPoint vulnerability

466
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:28,180
to Microsoft and the research did leave

467
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,770
us with a couple of unanswered

468
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,380
questions such as why were there so many

469
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,440
victims in Poland or why were there so

470
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,780
many victims overall since we know that

471
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,970
there were targeted attacks going on but

472
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,250
the number of victims was so large which

473
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,010
begs the question how many of these were

474
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,200
related how many of them were not and

475
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,060
what portion of them was just unintended

476
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,510
collateral damage and a couple of other

477
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,790
questions for you to think about and

478
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,120
that brings me to the end of my talk

479
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,239
thank you

480
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:09,070
okay we have lots of time for questions
