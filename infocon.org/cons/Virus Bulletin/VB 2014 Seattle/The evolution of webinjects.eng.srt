1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,730
okay we are going to continue with our

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,470
second presentation of this free

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,170
presentation track the next presentation

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,170
is by Zhang Jian boonton from ESET on

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,429
the evolution of weapon in jax

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:14,070
specifically with banking trojans

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,800
sharleyan yeah so hi everyone thank you

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,920
for attending my talk so as rigored said

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,330
my part would be about evolution of web

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,760
inject so this all started because I've

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,470
been researching back in chosen for

12
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,310
several years now and basically once you

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,859
get to a point where you look at the

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,510
different web index that these making

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,820
chosen are using you see some code reuse

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,610
and you see that some of the images are

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,920
using are the true attack code that are

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,500
used to get login information attempt

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,629
version transfers and all these kinds of

20
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,450
nefarious things so it sparked a

21
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,879
question like is there a common banking

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,739
children like a common web inject

23
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,320
platform that is used by several banking

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,410
children world worldwide and just to

25
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,210
make a link with what we've seen a while

26
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,030
ago with black at blackpool exploit kit

27
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,489
so some kind of web inject platform that

28
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,400
would be ubiquitous basically but before

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,770
trying to answer this question we'll

30
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,360
take a quick look at the evolution of

31
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,070
web injects so this is going to be the

32
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,409
first section then I'm going to look at

33
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,930
the commoditization of the index then

34
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,750
we're going to take a quick look at the

35
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,460
emergence of popular kits and finally

36
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,960
how these web injects are actually

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,750
delivered to the buds so let's first

38
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,810
start with the evolution so at the very

39
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,990
beginning the banking Trojans were using

40
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,189
keyloggers so that we're using

41
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,960
keyloggers to gather log information

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,780
password then they moved on to phone

43
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,369
grabbing and there are still using phone

44
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,290
grabbing so how this works that they

45
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,270
will inspect dead post requests coming

46
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,280
out of specific website I trying to

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,280
gather login information and basically

48
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,159
any data that is sent to the server then

49
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,530
came along web inject so they realize

50
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,049
that by actually hooking the web browser

51
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,509
they could actually inject code into the

52
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,090
web page I usually seeing meaning that

53
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,520
they could control what users seeing and

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,920
they could actually interact with the

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,080
the web page content at the very

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,599
beginning there were only a couple of

57
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,370
banking children using them it was

58
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,770
specific to the page to the particular

59
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,380
platform only a couple of institutions

60
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,790
were available most of the time

61
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,520
geo-located but of course as things I've

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,970
evolved as banking Trojans are now sold

63
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,890
commonly undergone firms and there are a

64
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,890
lot more institutions that are targeted

65
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,160
now so we will take a quick look at the

66
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,870
popular web inject format so this is the

67
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,330
Zeus web inject format but this format

68
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,310
is now used by a wide array of banking

69
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,640
Trojans and this is a good thing for

70
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,410
inject coders that we'll talk about

71
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,720
later on so this allow them to actually

72
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,430
have a common format that they can use

73
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,489
to write their injects so we'll briefly

74
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:56,549
take a look at different keywords that

75
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:58,440
are present in the web inject

76
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,420
configuration file so the configuration

77
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,190
file that is downloaded by the but from

78
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,830
the C&C server so the set URL here you

79
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,390
see it will specify the target URL then

80
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,310
at the end you can have some flags in

81
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,010
this case it's GP this is forget post so

82
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,140
that means that it will inspect yet post

83
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,600
requests coming out of the browser

84
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,180
basically there are other flags I can

85
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,310
log the actual content of the web page

86
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,310
as well other keywords like data before

87
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,410
and data after so that will tell the

88
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,090
banking children where to actually

89
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,880
inject the the code and this is of

90
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,489
course the the code so this one is very

91
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:37,260
is very simple but sometimes you can

92
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,959
have conflicts and a large portion of

93
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,600
cold there so let's take a quick look at

94
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,000
the meaningful capabilities now included

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,280
in some web injects so first you have

96
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,109
logging grabber so this is very simple

97
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:51,690
where when the user is logging in in one

98
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,920
of his account through a compromise

99
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,500
computer the web in Jack will grab the

100
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,500
login information then it can inject

101
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,709
additional fields into a web page so

102
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,870
these fields will usually try to gather

103
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,489
more personal information credit card

104
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:07,410
information these kind of things then

105
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,730
you have something called balanced

106
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,950
robber so whenever the user accesses

107
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,170
account the web and Jack will be able to

108
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,500
see the idea the balance on each account

109
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,350
and maybe say

110
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,329
use the one with the is one then you

111
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,130
have baddest balance changer so as

112
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,710
people are trying to make proton

113
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,840
transfers then these web index will be

114
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,970
able to hide the fact that some money

115
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,980
was transferred if the user is accessing

116
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,960
is a second really compromised computer

117
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,510
then you have the 10 rubber so tan means

118
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,550
transaction to rescission number we'll

119
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,100
see bit later what these are exactly but

120
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,850
it's a 60 measures put by a bank to make

121
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,920
do the overall process of online banking

122
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,170
a bit more secure and of course the web

123
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,180
in jacks are trying to get the stand

124
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,950
from the user and finally you have

125
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,140
automatic transfer systems you can see

126
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,530
80s is the acronym in an easy for aptos

127
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,230
I live sorry Russian transition so this

128
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,810
is the Russian name basically and these

129
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,070
systems are used to try to make

130
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,750
automatic transfer going on without the

131
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,480
user knowing so will first take a look

132
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,430
at what i call the fish-like injects so

133
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,620
here you see a form that is injected as

134
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,560
the user is trying to access one of his

135
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,690
account so you see that several fields

136
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,240
are added so if the user actually go and

137
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,760
type all this information once it says

138
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,560
continue then all of this information

139
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,200
will be sent back to the C&C server so

140
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,730
that the fraudster can actually use this

141
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,190
information here it says that is for

142
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,290
verification purposes that the user must

143
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,300
have led some of their information of

144
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,130
course this is all fake and its really

145
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,330
web inject in that is residing in the

146
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,130
browser that is doing all the work so

147
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,750
this is very simple code that can

148
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,580
achieve that and it might not be as

149
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,650
lucrative but it is a very simple way to

150
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,750
try to gather personal information from

151
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,550
a compromised computer of course other

152
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,740
systems are much more complex so

153
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,540
automatic transfer system what they are

154
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,640
trying to do is really as soon as the

155
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,830
user is a logging into his bank account

156
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,560
they will try to make transfer from the

157
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,850
victim's account to a million new

158
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,580
account all this automatically so the

159
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,290
bot master doesn't have to interact with

160
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,790
anything and as the banks of course

161
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,530
they're not sitting idle they are trying

162
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,980
to add new security measures such as

163
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,120
two-factor authentication so some of

164
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,730
these system I've means to try to bypass

165
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,500
these security measures

166
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,020
we were seeing a lot of these in the

167
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,230
past months we eight years but now it

168
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,550
seems like there are some kind of

169
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,650
reduced popularity because the code to

170
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,140
use to be able to do it to make transfer

171
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,780
systems it's very complex so the bank's

172
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,970
seems to have catch up and now we see

173
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,370
more people trying to do more simple

174
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,560
simple web enjoys I will try to gather

175
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,660
information from the victim and then

176
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,460
we'll do some manual transfer instead of

177
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,140
trying to automate the deal the overall

178
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,060
process what you see here in the

179
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,570
screenshot is actually a function that

180
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,970
you can say well include a random time

181
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,040
out between actions so this is a

182
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,230
snapshot from a web inject I found and

183
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,210
basically to try to buy by some animal a

184
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,940
detector that might be put in place by

185
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,160
banks you can have random time outs

186
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,570
between different actions such as

187
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,700
browsing to a different webpage trying

188
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,830
to specify the the account number and

189
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,070
these kind of actions so since we're in

190
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,850
the US and i'm not sure if any US banks

191
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,830
are actually using to a transaction

192
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,030
authorized ation number i just want to

193
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,580
briefly say what they are so here on the

194
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,060
life you see the chip pan so this is a

195
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,410
mechanism where the user will be asked

196
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,660
to enter a pin and then a transaction

197
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,640
interrelation number will be will be

198
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,340
given by the little machine and this is

199
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,620
needed for critical operation such as

200
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,010
looking into account or attempting

201
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,050
transfers the other one is mobile town

202
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,150
so in the end and the user will receive

203
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,760
an S&S containing a code a unique one

204
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,770
that is always changing of course Andy

205
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,470
must and put them into the into the web

206
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,419
page is saying so that the reaction can

207
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:11,630
go through of course the frost one too

208
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,120
far behind to try to grab these tan this

209
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,940
is a form that is injected into a web

210
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,190
page that will ask the user for specific

211
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,110
done in this particular case they're

212
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,880
saying that they need to verify their

213
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,890
unique digital signature of course I've

214
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,040
seen a wide array of different lies to

215
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,140
try to learn the user into giving up a

216
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,099
tan and this is only one of them as I

217
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:36,708
said they are also mobile tan and what

218
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,710
the first sir are trying to do in this

219
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,419
aces sometimes they're trying to make

220
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,309
the user installed a mobile malware on

221
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,190
their phone so here you can see a form

222
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,170
that was injected as a user is accessing

223
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,330
one other account through a compromised

224
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,700
computer asking them several information

225
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,740
about their mobile phone if they go

226
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,220
ahead and enter all of this then they

227
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,370
will they will be able to download

228
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,300
malware on their phone and then they

229
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,130
have to manually install it of course

230
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,250
this is very complex not complex but

231
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,080
there are a lot of steps to be done by

232
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,970
the users so it's not it's it's the the

233
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,340
user must really convinced that its

234
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,380
reader Bank not doing this because the

235
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,030
mobile phone will actually tell them

236
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,190
that this is an insecure thing this

237
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,370
mobile malware thing it happened several

238
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,070
years ago assume 2010 there was loosing

239
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,440
the mobile that appear which was first

240
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,330
for symbian platforms and then they were

241
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,790
added to android and blackberry and that

242
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,350
was a mobile malware there was specific

243
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,170
for Zeus of course you we saw several

244
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,840
others such as spying the mobile carb up

245
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,000
in the mobile but there now we see

246
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,770
mobile committed a shin as well as we

247
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,990
will review this but that means that

248
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,450
some mobile malware are now sold

249
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,510
underground firms which are able to

250
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,370
interact with most of the banking chores

251
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,140
and platforms in a tie to a specific

252
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,290
platform so I want to bring your

253
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,540
attention to this this work there so

254
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,360
this is Facebook so basically this

255
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,320
specific index was targeting Facebook so

256
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,420
in the past web injects have targeted a

257
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,850
lot financial institutions but we there

258
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,530
are a lot of web injects targeting at

259
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,050
popular web services as well so usually

260
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,150
there are fish like web injects as i

261
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,400
call them earlier so as soon as the troy

262
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,650
as the user will try to access when as i

263
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,360
found through a compromise computer it

264
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,830
will be asked for personal information

265
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,020
create confirmation and if we actually

266
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,180
put them then these will be sent to

267
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,510
cincy so the web inject now are not only

268
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,170
restricted to financial institution so

269
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,000
that's it for the the web inject

270
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,710
evolution so as you can see there are

271
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,260
many things that have evolved through

272
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,510
our packs and you see that some of these

273
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,970
code is really complex so if we look at

274
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,040
other may transfer system or screws like

275
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,699
an automatic

276
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:55,179
change account account balance and the

277
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:59,139
other thing so the that led to web web

278
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:00,730
inject metallization so people

279
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,399
specializing in to writing listen Jack

280
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,100
code as the complexity were increasing

281
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,489
and of course when people are trying to

282
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:12,249
write inject some custom tools appear so

283
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:14,109
here you see a screenshot of config

284
00:11:14,109 --> 00:11:15,879
builder so that was part of the Carver

285
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:18,069
bleak the lap and a while ago and this

286
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:20,439
is a tool specifically written to ease

287
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:22,689
the process of writing web in JS so they

288
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:25,660
are an internet explorer and embedded in

289
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,999
this where you can debug and test all

290
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:30,699
the injects your writing some of the

291
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:33,249
banking children's will try to target a

292
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:35,679
wide array of institutions in a wide

293
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,329
array of countries and some of them will

294
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:41,319
try to target specific countries in in a

295
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:43,569
specific regions that's it so of course

296
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,009
there are web in Jack's old and

297
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:46,569
underground firms with that so here you

298
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:51,179
see a guy called MH 00077 which is

299
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:53,850
selling lady calls cheap web in jax and

300
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:57,579
even as a website that you can see here

301
00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:00,160
and he has injects for several countries

302
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,679
in throughout the world and whenever you

303
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,269
click on these flags you get to a point

304
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:06,519
where several institutions are also a

305
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,829
targeted / countries since I'm from

306
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:13,809
Canada I'm found of official languages

307
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:16,389
and in Canada the institutions are

308
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:18,249
presenting Quebec which is a French

309
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:20,709
province in Canada have both French and

310
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:23,109
English so there's a little attention to

311
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,239
detail but you can see that the New

312
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:27,910
Zealand flag is not quite right there so

313
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,429
there are some some mistake done by like

314
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:33,639
this guy's so he will sell mostly fish

315
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,299
like injects and I'm on average if they

316
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,249
sell it for one hundred dollars so it's

317
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:40,899
not something that is very very

318
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:43,809
expensive and you actually less all the

319
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:45,819
platforms are compatible and you also

320
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:47,739
list if it's comfortable different

321
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:50,799
browsers want an explorer chrome and 75

322
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,499
bucks but other sellers are selling

323
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:57,009
where there are way more complex so Yuma

324
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,210
is another seller that is

325
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,200
specializing in to selling automatic

326
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,150
transfer system web injects in this

327
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,820
particular code posts you see that he is

328
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,130
bonding perkele with his webbing Jake's

329
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:12,120
particularly is a mobile malware that

330
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,190
was sold in the ground firms that would

331
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,290
be able to divert SMSs from the victim

332
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,150
phone to the attacker phone meaning that

333
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,010
they could intercept the end time that

334
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,650
the bank will be send in to the victim

335
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,800
phone and perkele was the first platform

336
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,440
independent i'm obama where that had

337
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,600
several designs for several banks around

338
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,700
the world so you could buy it and bundle

339
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,820
it into your into your banking children

340
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,570
allowing you to bypass this M time

341
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,390
security measure interestingly perkele

342
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,490
was bundle at this point but i found out

343
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,260
that later on he switched to I banking

344
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,790
so I banking is another mobile malware

345
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,040
that is available in other ground firms

346
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,520
but is with is much more advanced so we

347
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,800
can record calls still SNS is still

348
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,510
contact information so it's interesting

349
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,450
to see that the the offering is evolving

350
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,790
through time as well and the other point

351
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,310
I want to make here is that this guy who

352
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,290
is targeting in this particular one I 10

353
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,780
yesterday it's a dud it's the dirt bank

354
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,020
a German bank he knows that mobile tan

355
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,610
are used by this bank so we will go

356
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,950
ahead and try to bundle as many tool as

357
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,690
possible to make the process of

358
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,860
defrauding people easier of course as

359
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,990
things are becoming more complex and as

360
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,880
people are buying them on the internet

361
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,130
well they need a way to control them so

362
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,020
most of the inject coders who are

363
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,300
selling a TSO web index which are more

364
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,190
complex are also bundling administration

365
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,620
panel with their offering meaning that

366
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,570
they can have information on each bud

367
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,670
that is compromised being able to have

368
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,280
account information and let's say

369
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,170
specify drop account for different buds

370
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,570
and also attempt automatic transfer

371
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:53,250
through them and also the the different

372
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,900
colors they are now offering different

373
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,630
partnerships so usually you see two

374
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,370
types of offering for web injects the

375
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,200
public and private so public web injects

376
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,390
will be available to anyone so the

377
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,850
decoder will build them and then you can

378
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,440
buy them but they are available to

379
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,990
anyone that has money to buy them in the

380
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,390
private mode then they will go something

381
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,150
specific you specific for particular

382
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,160
banks they will fit you need and you can

383
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,200
actually you gain ownership of the via

384
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,970
web injection and you can resell it so

385
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,200
several coders really explain that in a

386
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,090
lot of detail how these partnerships

387
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,230
work one thing I've seen that made me

388
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,970
curious is that one guy was looking for

389
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,440
people that were willing to share

390
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,420
revenue of a botnet so it would be

391
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,540
providing web injects targeting

392
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,520
institution that that this but net was

393
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,580
present in and you would ask for a share

394
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,960
of the revenue so it's interesting

395
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,880
because you get to a point where these

396
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,560
things in the eye of the code or at

397
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,780
least are so complex that they mean that

398
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,170
they are entitled to get the portion of

399
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:59,670
the revenue so with the commoditization

400
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,280
now that you have a lot of product ins

401
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,190
on sale in different on the run firm you

402
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,020
have everything that is required to get

403
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,880
to a point where some kids will be more

404
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,060
popular than others so in this section I

405
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,160
will show you two different kids that

406
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,290
I've seen in several banking children's

407
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,160
that are very prevalent the first one is

408
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,910
80s engine so this is a the panel of the

409
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,030
EITS engine and this is from the guy who

410
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,090
was selling the perkele so you mwah so

411
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,000
this is what he is selling and I've seen

412
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,920
them in several banking children as you

413
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,190
can see here and this guy has fully

414
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,040
pious web injects for wide array of

415
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,340
institutions he can do ten mitigation

416
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,160
can do is bundling mobile malware so

417
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,050
we've seen that is bounding perkily but

418
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,300
is also a bounding I banking with it and

419
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,670
he has one framework that I found

420
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,160
interesting so he has something he calls

421
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,320
a full information grabber framework so

422
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,510
usually how these works is that you have

423
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,340
this web inject configuration file that

424
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,650
will be downloaded by cincy and that

425
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,420
will contain specific index for each

426
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,670
institution so you will get let's say if

427
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,220
you are targeting ten US banks and 10k

428
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,199
and Langston you will have all of these

429
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,449
separated knee in the configuration file

430
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:17,220
but this guy what he is doing is that II

431
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,829
build a framework where is injects are

432
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:22,890
compatible with a wide array of bank so

433
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,220
it

434
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,549
detect on which website you are and then

435
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:29,850
it will reuse most of the the web inject

436
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,630
content to target specific specific

437
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,970
institutions and yeah he has a web panel

438
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,809
for this so you don't have to try to get

439
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,610
all the information from different panel

440
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,890
in the same panel yet all of the the

441
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,299
banks that you are targeting another

442
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,039
platform that is that I've seen quite a

443
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:54,210
lot is called injuria here you see that

444
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,770
it's downloaded from an external server

445
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,380
and you see at the very end that the URL

446
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,780
has a very specific format so there is a

447
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,470
base64 encoded part to it and let's take

448
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,780
a quick look at what this base64 decode

449
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,929
to and well it will is that you have the

450
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:12,030
project type with the project name so

451
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,500
the project name will usually be the

452
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,450
name of the banks that is targeted by

453
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,820
this specific platform and then you have

454
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,850
these keywords just before the dash and

455
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,730
in the lock thing the they will try to

456
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,909
our with some personal information from

457
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:29,340
the victim account so in the log a

458
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,659
secret car information login information

459
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:35,280
SSN these kind of things for the mob in

460
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,190
the app they will use the mobile malware

461
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,230
so we will try to learn a user into

462
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,789
installing mobile malware so that the

463
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:45,659
mobile town can be obtained then finally

464
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:48,330
in the for the wreck 1 this is when

465
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,549
let's say chipton are you so the the

466
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:53,400
pictures with with earlier so they have

467
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,559
no way to actually infect the device so

468
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,240
they will you still try use social

469
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,700
engineering to get distance saying the

470
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,210
user that lets say a test transfer must

471
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,630
be conducted and then you will the user

472
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,940
might be might provide the decoding so

473
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,220
of course before knowing which platforms

474
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,630
are popular we need a way to actually

475
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,450
track them so i will briefly explain how

476
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,720
i'm doing this process so since the same

477
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,390
coder are producing this where you get

478
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,370
to a point where you can actually feel

479
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,620
that is the same guy doing it so you

480
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,030
have function names which are similar

481
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,309
code structure which is similar as well

482
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:34,679
the URL that they are using because most

483
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:35,590
of the time they will

484
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,440
cloody and in panel URL in in the

485
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,230
webbing check so all of this you can get

486
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,330
a feeling that this is the same guy then

487
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,919
the admin panel design so i showed you

488
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:47,380
two different panels so if you actually

489
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,690
browse into this panel and that did the

490
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,159
panel design is the same this is another

491
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:53,950
hand that the same color is behind it

492
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,190
and if you are lucky enough to get your

493
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,440
hand on the underground adverts then you

494
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,809
can do some feature correlation so if

495
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,370
you have an injector is targeting a

496
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,049
specific bank that is using a mobile

497
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:07,570
malware and then you know that the guy

498
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,399
is advertising for the specific bank

499
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:11,529
with this mobile malware then you have a

500
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:13,990
good feeling that it is coming from the

501
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,779
this encoder of course you cannot be

502
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:18,820
hundred percent sure but if all these

503
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,520
things are grouped together then you can

504
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,590
have a high level of confidence that

505
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,340
this is exactly the same guy will go

506
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,380
through this process for dat s engine so

507
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,940
that was the first case I was showing

508
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,779
you earlier here you see that it's an

509
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:37,059
external don't download and it's adding

510
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:38,559
a number at the very end of the URL

511
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,440
based on the current date so of course

512
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,049
for a dumb automatic analysis they will

513
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:46,210
never be able to actually get to this

514
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,490
other JavaScript because you need some

515
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,409
interpreter to it to have the full URL

516
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:53,500
and you my is using this trick all over

517
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,820
the place so it's not not only that this

518
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,039
is certainly not a proof that this is

519
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:03,490
the guy but it gives you a hint if you

520
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,020
download the other JavaScript this is a

521
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,880
very small snippet of what could be

522
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,529
downloaded in this particular case you

523
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:10,149
have comments that are presenting the

524
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:12,880
file which are always the same and you

525
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,710
have specific variables as well that are

526
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:18,039
used here you see own link and this is

527
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:22,510
actually the link to the admin panel so

528
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,880
with all the this in place you know by

529
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,130
looking at the code that this is

530
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,929
familiar then you have this down the

531
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:30,730
external javascript that is downloaded

532
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,890
that it contains a lot of information

533
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,260
that is similar to what Yuma is doing

534
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,360
and then you have this ending panel

535
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,049
which is similar so you can have you can

536
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,880
have pretty good feeling of who is

537
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,090
behind these these things so the last

538
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,170
section

539
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,670
want to discuss now is web inject

540
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,100
delivery so of course as people are

541
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,440
buying them in underground firms things

542
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,480
have changed a bit how these web injects

543
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,210
are delivered and how the how they are

544
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,250
stated in the web inject configuration

545
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,140
file so this is the first thing we're

546
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,300
going to look at here you see an

547
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,310
external download so the inject code

548
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,320
that will be injected in the browser is

549
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,960
only a URL so you don't have access to a

550
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,160
two to two and two nothing else and this

551
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,350
is injuria you can see the base64 thing

552
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,300
that will decode to one of the projects

553
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:24,600
have shown earlier and the other way to

554
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,490
provide these these indexes by inlining

555
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,170
them directly in the web inject a

556
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,900
configuration file so when the but will

557
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,090
download them from the CNC then

558
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,550
everything is there in the web inject so

559
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:39,040
you can there's no first steps are

560
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,780
needed to analyze the web injects

561
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,970
completely let's take a quick look at

562
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,610
the the advantages of external download

563
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,410
of JavaScript so of course it can in

564
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,060
their forensic analysis because if you

565
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,730
get to a computer that has never access

566
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,890
this this this banking page and you will

567
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,770
not be able to see what was the content

568
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,860
of the JavaScript and maybe the server

569
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,480
is down at this point so you have no way

570
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,550
of actually knowing what the JavaScript

571
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,680
would do at this point it also need by

572
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,480
enable feature-based selling so some of

573
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,180
the encoder will will charge different

574
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,550
prices for different feature so it's if

575
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,750
you want balance grabber balance

576
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,180
modification then by providing the strip

577
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,530
on external server it's easier for them

578
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,060
to actually play with that and

579
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,310
maintenance as well because some of the

580
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,500
inject color will actually try to a Fisk

581
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,090
ate as much as possible the inject that

582
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,160
they are selling so that the user cannot

583
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,670
reuse them in or we sell them so if you

584
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,980
have a piece of alpha skated code it

585
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,980
becomes very difficult to get to a point

586
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,480
to maintain it yourself so by having

587
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,270
this it's way easier and of course the

588
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,440
the web in Jekyll or not do not need to

589
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,210
be downloaded right away you can you can

590
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,790
wait a bit until the guy actually visit

591
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,010
the website so i just want to show you

592
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,780
quickly the external server interaction

593
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,510
so when you have a web inject server

594
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,780
then that means that the secure research

595
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,920
you can actually interact with the

596
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,530
server here you see a web inject a

597
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,750
framework with like there's a

598
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,420
distinctive use of efficient for the

599
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,680
function name but of course the most

600
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,660
distinctive thing is how it interacts

601
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,420
through the external server so it will

602
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,940
call the server with a specific function

603
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,770
name the server will answer back with

604
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,180
this function and this function will be

605
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,010
inserted dynamically into the webpage

606
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,160
and be educated by your browser here you

607
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,520
see that it's providing state

608
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,380
information but of course you can have a

609
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,240
real code so whenever you download this

610
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,160
trip from the external server you really

611
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,200
have to go through all the steps to get

612
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,690
to a point where you get all the

613
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,100
information you need to really study

614
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,280
this this trip the last thing i want to

615
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,500
show you about this is by playing with

616
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,300
it you might get to a point where you

617
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,040
get to something very interesting so

618
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,830
this is a drop account for MU so by

619
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,080
interacting and really understanding how

620
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,330
these webinars are working I was able to

621
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,510
get to to this to these information so

622
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,190
this is very valuable for security

623
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,720
searcher because you can do notification

624
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,000
you can know you can have a better

625
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,800
understanding of how these people are

626
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:13,080
our operating so all of this means that

627
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,760
it's it's harder as well to get

628
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,740
information from the web inject because

629
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,990
you really have so these servers are

630
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,140
stateful so you get to a point where to

631
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,520
get all the information you need you

632
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,320
have to respect some order you cannot

633
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,420
just try to leach all content from it so

634
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,420
this goes for images but also for mobile

635
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,160
malware components and all of this so

636
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,180
you really need to have a good

637
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,690
understanding of what's going on so in

638
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,450
conclusion we've seen that web injected

639
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,770
evolved tremendously in the past few

640
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,990
years and that in the several banking

641
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,060
children is actually to attack code the

642
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,950
code that will bring some benefits to

643
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,040
the two da to the fraudster web inject

644
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,990
my decision is well in place so there

645
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,360
are several coders are targeting several

646
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,520
institutions throughout the world and as

647
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,930
different web inject platforms are

648
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,430
available well some are more popular

649
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,410
than some are more popular than others

650
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,330
so if we go back to my original question

651
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,820
asking well is there one specific

652
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,150
platform that is like ubiquitous well

653
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,770
the answer is no but there are certainly

654
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,450
some that are way more popular than

655
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:12,920
others

656
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:18,580
so thank you okay
