1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
good afternoon and welcome back from

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,839
lunch so our first speaker today is from

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,889
HP Jang Moo co I was very excited to see

4
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:12,540
a demo until I realized that I'm

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,340
literally the only person in this room

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:23,609
who will not see it please begin yeah

7
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:29,460
hello good afternoon actually so today

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,189
I'm going to talk about smart home

9
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:37,710
appliances security and malware and out

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,489
of all those smart devices appliances we

11
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,620
chose smart TV because TVs are

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,989
everywhere actually so if you vote any

13
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:52,520
TVs recently like three or four years

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,190
ago probably the chances are that you

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,530
might have smart TVs at your home

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,379
probably you might not notice it but the

17
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,090
interface is if you look at the TV here

18
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:10,260
so it has some gadgets or gimmicks here

19
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,110
so you can watch photos or movies or you

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,159
can even play youtube so I force when I

21
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,170
bought it this TV like last year

22
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,240
actually this is now from company I this

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,970
is my personal TV I just brought it from

24
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,939
my home and when I just bought this TV

25
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,060
our last year I thought that I heard

26
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,640
someone is hacking TV at the time but I

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,170
thought that it will be really really

28
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,840
difficult to hack the TV because they

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,150
might be using their own OS and there

30
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,619
they have their own settings so it's

31
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,350
really hard to find information right so

32
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,540
but i just spent one or two week to

33
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:59,670
prove whether I'm Roman right so that is

34
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,880
how this all happened and the things

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,759
that the IOT thing is still in very very

36
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,788
early stage but the smart TV has been

37
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:10,318
around like I need four or five years

38
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,810
the oldest model

39
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,730
came and needs two thousand able two

40
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,160
thousand nine from Samsung and there are

41
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,319
a lot of big players like Samsung LG

42
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,290
Panasonic are there and they have good

43
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,209
money to funding there and they have

44
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:26,640
money to hire a lot of security

45
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,860
researchers there so they they have good

46
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,050
conditions there so if we look at the

47
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,150
Smart TV the state of the security in

48
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,970
Smart TV then maybe you can see what

49
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,709
will happen with IOT yeah right the best

50
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:43,290
case for IOT because usually though I or

51
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,959
three companies there are very small

52
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,330
startups they don't have enough money so

53
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,730
they don't have enough funding to hire

54
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,030
any security researchers or to pay

55
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,599
attention to security so smart TV is

56
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,599
really a good starting point to look

57
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,680
into the IOT security actually so the

58
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,080
reason why i chose Samsung TVs is that

59
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,000
this tip is really really popular

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,630
actually it has the around twenty six

61
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,850
percent market share from those studies

62
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:21,329
statistics and the other thing is that

63
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,790
the hacking community for these TVs

64
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,280
really really active and I could get a

65
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,920
lot of information from Sam eagle web

66
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,190
forum and in that way I could have I

67
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,569
could start from better ground and there

68
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:40,230
were also like four or five prior

69
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,260
researcher research is there the first

70
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,380
one was actually from 2012 like one more

71
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,440
two years ago each of a file retrieval

72
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,260
vulnerability and there were some other

73
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,850
researches and the recently 2014 january

74
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,989
there was a remote attack discourse by

75
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,989
by the researchers from marine institute

76
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:06,120
of technology researchers actually on

77
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,959
and the problem they disclosed was

78
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,090
actually they were using ffmpeg the

79
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,420
popular media player and from like a

80
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,488
2012 model they were using a very old

81
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:23,610
ffmpeg library so they used cv 2009

82
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,710
something to exploit the TV

83
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,819
so the TV was not updated like during

84
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:34,380
like a three or four years so the agenda

85
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,289
that i have is very straightforward i'm

86
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:39,389
going to show how i can remote access to

87
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:42,690
TV and how i can install malware the

88
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,849
market that i created actually for demo

89
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:47,550
and i will show actual demo and i will

90
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,470
talk about how the samsung or other

91
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,030
vendors are responding all these issues

92
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:59,239
so the first part the remote access so

93
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,840
so this is the TV then the orissa there

94
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,229
is one smart feature on in samsung TV so

95
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:09,690
you can actually control the TV using

96
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,930
your phone not the IR but using the

97
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,979
network actually so if you try to pair

98
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:20,699
your iphone or android phone you can

99
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,740
download the app free from the App Store

100
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,349
it will actually pop up the dialogue

101
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:27,210
dialogue box and you should authorize

102
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,500
the device using your physical remote

103
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,520
controller so in that way it achieves

104
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,150
some kind of security so you need to be

105
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,219
around the TV to gain the access to the

106
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,729
TV so in there that you can actually do

107
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:49,560
everything like a volume up or down

108
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,229
channel change and you can launch some

109
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:57,900
apps go to some menus and next one so

110
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,719
when you try to pair new device actually

111
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:04,680
it will pop up on these dialog box so if

112
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,590
you josé Paulo then you have access to

113
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,370
you I pull you I that same you is you

114
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,500
will have via this remote control and

115
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,610
actually if you go through some menus

116
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,650
they have they maintain the access

117
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,120
control list very straight for the

118
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,570
hostname IP address whether it's allowed

119
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,560
or denied its kind of viral like access

120
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,460
list and if you take the dump when you

121
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,889
actually pair or send some comment from

122
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:36,839
your iPhone or Android phone

123
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:39,969
the package looks like that and they use

124
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:43,449
their own protocol so there might be

125
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:45,749
something wrong with during from it

126
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:48,969
implementation may be so I just reverse

127
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:50,849
engineer the binary that actually

128
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:54,669
processes the packet and it has some

129
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:57,819
processing routines there and pocket

130
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,639
passer and it is checking the access

131
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,339
control lists there and the thing is

132
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,969
that if you parse the packet it's really

133
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,589
easy because they are using very

134
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:10,979
straightforward for my like a length

135
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:15,399
data and payload and some types and

136
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,830
something like that but eventually they

137
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,020
are using some base64 string encoding

138
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,849
there and if you decode them actually

139
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:24,539
they are using three factors for

140
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,039
authentication the first one is IP

141
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,319
address second one is mag address and

142
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:33,460
third one is hostname so these all

143
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,210
informations are all available if you

144
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,069
are already in the same network right so

145
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:41,349
all these informations are just cascade

146
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:45,819
like constantly and you can try all of

147
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:47,529
them if you find them because just

148
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:49,029
trying all of them doesn't take that

149
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:52,389
much effort so probably if one of them

150
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,430
are authenticated already you can easily

151
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,560
get into the TV so there is the

152
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,399
fundamental design flaw and actually

153
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:02,199
Samsung didn't fix it like for a long

154
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:05,259
time but they finally I'll change the

155
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:08,110
format we are each coming they are

156
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,599
working on it and it is released for

157
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,550
some models but they have like five

158
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,709
thousand different models with their TV

159
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:17,770
so it takes one or two months so the fix

160
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,959
will come if you go home and if you are

161
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,999
using samsung TV you see some pop-ups

162
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:24,879
whether you you want update your TV you

163
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,939
should update it and so I thought that

164
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:29,499
the first II issue is really critical

165
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:34,719
but the next one is um a little bit

166
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,389
disturbing right so I thought that it's

167
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:40,779
using IP address and hostname but from

168
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:43,120
from the implementation actually there

169
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,550
were just totally ignoring IP address

170
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,140
and hostname so you just need to guess

171
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,500
mega dress so it's get

172
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,070
or easier but it's not enough actually

173
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,110
so there is a volar with number three

174
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:01,270
and if you pass mega dress with no then

175
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,600
actually you're always granted access to

176
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,630
any system that has it oh and this one

177
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,600
or remote control of authorized

178
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,240
authorized so if you anyone just used

179
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,880
that feature and he forgot about lead

180
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,240
Michael past six months if you send this

181
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,010
package you are just opening the door

182
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,880
the TV and the next one is very

183
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,950
interesting because this is not a fourth

184
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,740
from Samsung actually right so from the

185
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,760
iphone iOS 7 when you try to retrieve

186
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,850
the mac address from your phone actually

187
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,270
it will be giving you same string always

188
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,860
so but Samsung didn't like notice that

189
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,520
for a long time so if you you anyone

190
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,460
ever used a iphone for authentication

191
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,770
you can just send this back and you are

192
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,670
just authenticated so just simple

193
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,620
protocol and there are too many

194
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,640
vulnerabilities and that is what I

195
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,500
observed here and there is actual attack

196
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,440
so smart view is a pc version of the

197
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,810
remote controller so from the attacker

198
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:18,210
it tries to connect to the TV right then

199
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,040
if you double click it it will try to

200
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,440
connect to the TV and you will pop up

201
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,089
this dialog box but you can use exploit

202
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:30,760
to send one keystroke just you can send

203
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,950
enter and you can make your pc or like

204
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:42,089
authorized for the TV so its end

205
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:45,700
actually somehow you pop up twice you

206
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,480
need to send twice in turn there is a

207
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,510
Python script extent and the pop-up is

208
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,300
gone

209
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,050
ok so now from the application it is

210
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,300
authenticated and you can control the

211
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,170
volume or channel and the pc version has

212
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,020
some additional feature really

213
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,570
interesting feature if you go to the

214
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,610
View menu actually you can view the TV

215
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,830
so you can see what the users are doing

216
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,050
maybe he's using skype or facebook you

217
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,140
can read what he's doing so it's really

218
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,960
scary but this is not enough for

219
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,610
actually mulga so i need to figure out

220
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,250
how i can install malware using this man

221
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,460
field so there is one feature with a

222
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,380
samsung TV they allow any TVs to be used

223
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,020
as a developer machine so if you they

224
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,740
have same concept as iphone app store so

225
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,440
to log into the app store you need to

226
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,350
have a Samsung Account and if you pull

227
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,620
this hard coded or account to the

228
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,740
Samsung account login window then you

229
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,000
are in developer mode and if you go to

230
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,640
the apps menu there are additional menus

231
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,190
shown up here like IP settings and start

232
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,400
app sync menus and you can set up your

233
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,980
own absorber and you can put your own

234
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,440
app and you can make the TV to download

235
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,600
your own so in that way you can actually

236
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:30,339
install your binary on the TV like after

237
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:33,430
setting the IP IP address here like your

238
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,480
own IP and if you press the start

239
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,610
appsync and there is one problem so

240
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,820
actually last year a black hat on two

241
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,360
researchers from isaac partners they

242
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,870
talked about on using els binaries

243
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,970
packaging yep wineries in G file and

244
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:03,390
passing it as a as or a payload and

245
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:07,230
actually the security policy from the

246
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,180
app installer from Samsung actually

247
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,370
doesn't allow any inclusion of a lab

248
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,310
binaries so if users pass LF binder

249
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,400
itself those system triggers and what

250
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,840
they found is that if you ship it then

251
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,990
the app checker couldn't find you so

252
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,750
that's what they found so I did same

253
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,000
thing as what they did I just zip it and

254
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,240
passed it and they found it because that

255
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,550
auto body security evaluation actually

256
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,500
triggered because they reported it to

257
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,300
something and it is already fixed when I

258
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,800
put both this TV so I need to figure out

259
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,870
to walk around this fix and I just look

260
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:54,460
into the some actual code right so it is

261
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,650
checking whether is chipped or not and

262
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,930
the pd's chippy it is opening something

263
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,820
like that so it looked like really

264
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,770
challenging actually and the problem is

265
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,770
that toting is that actually the walk

266
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,270
around was too simple actually I just

267
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,950
figured out just five minutes or

268
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,980
something so the thing is that when you

269
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,440
try to install some malicious app

270
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,200
containing LFO binaries in a file or not

271
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,990
see file everything will be downloaded

272
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,150
to this temporary same folder the

273
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,690
hard-coded folder time to download & M

274
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,300
name so you can control where your file

275
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,130
will be dropped and after the you run

276
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,910
other that to just unzip the file but

277
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,510
cooking with Samsung Apps they have

278
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:48,280
actually the whole api's can s

279
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,920
hope file system so they're like a

280
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,940
sandbox is kind of actually from the

281
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,770
samsung documentation they never say

282
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,590
that they have sent box so they have

283
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:03,450
some security but it's not send the box

284
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,820
so using this API file on chip API

285
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,640
actually you can just access the file

286
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,000
and on chip Tory LFO binary anywhere on

287
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,520
the system you want so basically there

288
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,950
is no security so what they did with

289
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,820
2014 version of tea

290
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,240
e is just remove this API and they they

291
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,720
can fix the problem and this this

292
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,880
velocity was found by some ago via forum

293
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,400
not me and need to being used like again

294
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,890
and again with like a different exploit

295
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,830
and the other exploit that validity that

296
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:41,840
I used was this one is also found by

297
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,730
summing over for on this one is well

298
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,570
known one so when you over eyes some LF

299
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,330
binary you need to achieve persistence

300
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,830
it just like when you are doing with

301
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,440
Windows machine grinds to users right

302
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,660
registry start of registry and or you

303
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,270
can just drop it on startup folder you

304
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,400
can do same thing where the TV so this

305
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,080
leave skype so share the object file

306
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,660
this one will be always loaded if you

307
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,450
check the skype to start off application

308
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,820
so users over at this file and you can

309
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,400
just put some back to loading here and

310
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,710
users check the skype to load every time

311
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:24,410
then whenever the TV turns on your back

312
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,800
to will just comes on so currently this

313
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,470
machine is my TV is factored it has

314
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,080
secure shell running ftp running some

315
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,300
web server and every sitting there

316
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,500
really scary machine actually but the

317
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,970
things that even though your machine is

318
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,450
infected there is no sign or no tools no

319
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,100
way to know whether your motion using

320
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,140
effective there is most scary part

321
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,510
because I don't think there will be any

322
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,750
messy infection with TV but if some

323
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,850
government agencies if they want to

324
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,350
watch someone or watch someone's

325
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,800
activity or put some Pakistani photos on

326
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,320
the network maybe this one is really

327
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,589
ideal place because there is no tools no

328
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:10,400
abs nothing and if you ask in fact this

329
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,560
machine there is no way or just plain

330
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,689
users we know that this one is infected

331
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:18,530
and after I run the I download your

332
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,709
second there and updates just complete

333
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:25,390
and there is one at install the smiley

334
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,570
icon there and if you just are launched

335
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,850
it actually it'll just unzip the file

336
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,600
and over

337
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,179
the shared object so a lot of code I

338
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,610
just borrowed it from Sammy waveform

339
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,470
they have a lot of exploits available

340
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,150
there I could just learn from them

341
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,160
actually and I could write my own and

342
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,549
it's not that difficult so after that

343
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:48,169
you can just it will just launched its

344
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:49,880
own palace or were you just log in there

345
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,120
is no control here and it is running as

346
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,330
a route so you now have the root access

347
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,730
root privileges on the TV so in the way

348
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,299
from the very simple combining very very

349
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:04,880
simple vulnerabilities and you can just

350
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,289
on the TV so this is if you compare

351
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:13,220
owning some windows machine and this one

352
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,890
if windows much in the effort to only

353
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,580
windows machine is 10 this one is maybe

354
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:24,080
three or four it's that easy so if I

355
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,900
summarize a whole process so you can use

356
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,120
volatile one two three four you can use

357
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,610
one of them and you can just access the

358
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,460
UI but that is actually the users can

359
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,380
see what you are doing and probably they

360
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,909
don't understand what you're doing maybe

361
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,010
they say how they think it's glitch but

362
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,900
I don't know but this is just for demo

363
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:47,809
and you can enable developer mode and

364
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:50,600
try to install the on dropper app it

365
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,090
will trigger secret evaluation but still

366
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,010
the yelp we will be on the system the

367
00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:00,760
castle location and yellow fineries are

368
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,890
loaded or download it and if you run the

369
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,169
second app it will actually use that

370
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:09,320
downloaded file and on tripit and you it

371
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,679
will install some payload and after that

372
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:15,230
it will override skype module are to

373
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,280
achieve persistency so the last question

374
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,010
I have is that are really be possible to

375
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,980
create some mortgages just looks like a

376
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,460
normal windows module like some g votes

377
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,549
or whether there are a lot market or a

378
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:33,169
credential theft or something like that

379
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:35,900
actually I worked on some meam industry

380
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,090
so I know that and process hooking

381
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,700
probably if you do a lot windows thing

382
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,390
you know

383
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,120
oh that it is really really easy to hook

384
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,490
into the windows system calls anything

385
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,100
there are too many ways and we Linux

386
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,410
it's really easy too so there is a pit

387
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,910
to raise a feature that is used for

388
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,340
debugging and actually using this

389
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,910
feature you can actually make a program

390
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,800
stop and during the stub you can just

391
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,840
multiply the binary and you can resume

392
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,560
the whole process and you can make the

393
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,140
thread to load your own shared library

394
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,320
so each same as windows and CNC

395
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,780
communication it's dead simple Rangers

396
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,630
subject program is same and credential

397
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,900
theft there are multiple ways just like

398
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,680
windows maybe you can do mi-tm I will

399
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,990
demo there and you can inject some

400
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,450
module to some system process and you

401
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,390
can hook some API like a sand or

402
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,030
something like that there is all

403
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,770
possible so this is a demo

404
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,129
so the first one is

405
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,130
first one is the MIT am actually so I

406
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:11,460
will use the browser yeah there are too

407
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:19,170
many menus so they have their own web

408
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:24,500
browser it is based on the web kit

409
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:34,970
yeah I wanted to use a bank of america

410
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,029
example but I don't want to my

411
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:41,389
credentials shown here so i will use

412
00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:48,158
facebook me the fake account

413
00:21:54,659 --> 00:22:02,730
so you tell ya so there is a facebook

414
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:06,840
so

415
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,769
looks like

416
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:27,529
you know I just use the barb I can make

417
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:32,889
it look good for fishing and actually I

418
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:35,389
assume that you already change it

419
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:38,480
reserve the comp from the tee system

420
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,519
because you own the system or maybe you

421
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:43,220
can use a remote controller feature to

422
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,179
change the dns server so it's just using

423
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:49,460
all takers dns server so if you just try

424
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,169
to eat this is it too simple so actually

425
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,860
so so if you try to connect to facebook

426
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,539
the problem is that it's using HTTPS

427
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,929
and let me see

428
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:21,200
yeah actually I need to change so if you

429
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,870
see this terminal so if you are an

430
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,310
attacker you're just connecting to TV

431
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:30,920
just like the NX changer from windows so

432
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:37,370
you are oh sorry I'm not a good old

433
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,010
ticker right let's polka so just like a

434
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,640
DNA changer from Windows you can just

435
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,710
change this one read this one is all

436
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:59,290
takers IP very stable if we try

437
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,520
Oh actually you can use mouse we TV

438
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,169
actually they have your support and you

439
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:16,059
can use it but I leave them

440
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,940
yeah this day was the most difficult to

441
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,240
actually so because I have two more

442
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,960
Devils so hopefully I can finish in time

443
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,530
smooth

444
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:08,440
so

445
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:02,600
so you use https facebook yeah so from

446
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,650
the

447
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,299
from the poor even though it's using

448
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,150
HTTPS the browser doesn't complain about

449
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,770
the certificate this one is another

450
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,150
volar with you from Samsung but they

451
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,880
fixed it in April actually I inquiry

452
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,799
them and this same volar with you was

453
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:20,500
reported from a paper like almost two

454
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,010
years ago so you took some time for them

455
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:31,559
but and those you just put your email

456
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,559
five minutes

457
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:52,500
yeah these account is not enabled so

458
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,690
password

459
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,559
and password

460
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,470
sorry yeah

461
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:38,360
don't try to login oh I see yep moving

462
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,360
and we have boat traffic there but there

463
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,110
is a actually if you try to do same

464
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,240
thing with your Windows machine the

465
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,130
chrome we will complain about the fake

466
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,720
certificate and it will never allow you

467
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,750
to connect to these specs server and ie

468
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,659
will have some show some advanced option

469
00:27:56,659 --> 00:27:58,940
and if you just really sure you can

470
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,740
click it and you can connect with it but

471
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,770
they show some warnings but here it

472
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,390
doesn't show anything like it shows

473
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:09,740
these like a lock icon it looks like

474
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:14,779
they have no no use case of their lock

475
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:17,390
icon right so because if even when it is

476
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,490
broke it is connecting to the broken

477
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,710
Webster web server it is showing the log

478
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,440
is locked so it means that there is no

479
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,860
case where the log is or not in the icon

480
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,700
actually so anyway so if you try to look

481
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:37,029
get the information so from here

482
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:46,700
ya hear the email and pass so just like

483
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,450
same same concept windows you can just

484
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:56,179
intercept the traffic and I know there

485
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:58,219
are some others they are there are doing

486
00:28:58,219 --> 00:29:00,019
the same thing DNA's change or something

487
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:04,489
like that and the other next demo is

488
00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:09,469
using hooking into API to grab our other

489
00:29:09,469 --> 00:29:15,039
creditors so this one is much simple so

490
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:28,479
so i can just briefly explain the code

491
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,659
so there is a cold around here and

492
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:41,010
protect your activities just patching on

493
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:44,370
API it says open SSL APR and it was

494
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,789
patches it and you could just read out

495
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:52,440
the execution to your own booking

496
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,539
function the concept is almost the same

497
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:58,169
as windows like I said I'm looking XSL

498
00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:01,559
right hook RSS a right API and every

499
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,500
execution from this API will be coming

500
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,600
to this function and there are some

501
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,279
something like those things they are

502
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,760
just same concept as detours just like

503
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,140
replacing the instructions and put in

504
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,899
your own and something like that and

505
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:23,610
this function is actually dumping all

506
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:27,809
those information so I just wrong let me

507
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:32,270
see install so this script is just

508
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,100
unloading this shared object to the

509
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:41,220
server the TV and it will hook on the

510
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,570
API so it just succeeded and the next

511
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:50,340
one I show is the cooking Samsung

512
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,379
Account and yeah it's almost done

513
00:30:55,149 --> 00:31:04,320
so there is picture you log in network

514
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:14,080
yet something account and login so let

515
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,960
me see we will show you from the TV it

516
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,500
will save

517
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,010
yeah this file so it has some laws there

518
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:37,620
but you try to log in I think in the

519
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,059
interest of time we're going to have to

520
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:43,710
to cut this off yeah so this is less

521
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,809
morning to me so he shows are all those

522
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:48,470
traffic there

523
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,570
yet here you can see that the username

524
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,120
and password I just used some hard core

525
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,510
data account but if you use your own

526
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,640
account it could be just hooked like

527
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,860
that and the less the demo it's showing

528
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,830
entertaining the b-team so this is real

529
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,380
short just just one minute actually so

530
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:32,120
this one is just patching maybe you can

531
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,460
supply the the details to people who are

532
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:41,300
interested afterwards so everything this

533
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,810
TV is actually running on ax windows so

534
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:47,660
you can connect it if you're kind of

535
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,400
old-school you know the x window right

536
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,590
so it has some authentication its

537
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,340
opening 6,000 port and actually you can

538
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,960
run apps on your motion and display

539
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,060
everything on the TV or the extra

540
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,470
windows and but it has some

541
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:03,140
authentication I'm just patching the X

542
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,070
binary dynamically to disable the

543
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:11,090
authentication and the last one I can

544
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:21,470
entertain um the victim so yeah yeah

545
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:25,440
that's it yeah thank you

546
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,500
you
