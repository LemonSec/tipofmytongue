1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
running we've got Vincent ideas from

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,700
kaspersky lab's talking about OPSEC for

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,309
security researchers in certain thank

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:11,700
you my name is Ethan 30th and work for

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,349
kaspersky lab as principal security

6
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,109
analyst I'm based in Barcelona and half

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,960
of this presentation was done with the

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,400
Negro's unfortunately he couldn't make

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,100
it here for this presentation but half

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,519
of the square it is is for him so absurd

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,470
for security researchers where is this

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,960
talk about sorry guys do you think you

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,090
can dim the light a little bit because

14
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,420
it's all over thank you what is this

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,030
talk about object has been like a very

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,260
hot topic lately especially after it's

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,239
not a simulation of course so this talk

18
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,579
is like trying to put into context what

19
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,309
does OPSEC mean for security researchers

20
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,739
and what can we do about that it's not

21
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,960
providing just a set of tools it's not

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,199
just providing procedure is most like

23
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,570
the result of our thinking all this

24
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,579
because we've been like discussing model

25
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,939
about this lately with many researchers

26
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,159
and there is like many people concern

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,780
about this so according to this

28
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,430
definition operational security

29
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,229
identifies critical information to

30
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:14,909
determine if friendly actions can be a

31
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,630
source by a bursary intelligence system

32
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,400
in our opinion while there are many

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,619
definitions of course but in this talk

34
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,979
we will not only talk about identify but

35
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,500
what can we do about this also we are

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,909
not talking about counterintelligence

37
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,909
which is another common aspect of object

38
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:35,460
we are talking how to protect our assets

39
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,189
how to protect our information not how

40
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,939
to play with the adversary's and

41
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:43,530
especially we will put the context into

42
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,659
our industry this is the main point of

43
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,479
this so all of you have heard about many

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,909
up sex stories failures we're not going

45
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,490
through them we already know about that

46
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,920
but there is one lesson that we need to

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,890
learn from this and this is that shared

48
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,180
sorry silence is the golden rule so if

49
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,799
you know about something just keep it

50
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,380
for yourself but this is something

51
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,220
really really hard to do that's why I

52
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,569
say that you need at very high

53
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,500
discipline to

54
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,560
to apply this let me show you one

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,320
example you know about the mask carrito

56
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,490
that we publish in back in

57
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,650
january-february sorry this apt campaign

58
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,830
that had some spanish words around well

59
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,959
you know greedy oh no video is a

60
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,900
developer he was a member of the 29 aite

61
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,660
group probably this sounds familiar to

62
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,640
all of you and he was one of the

63
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,030
original developers in this group his

64
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,760
Spanish and the day after we publish the

65
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,280
corretto he changed his status in

66
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,890
Twitter to apt developer which is well

67
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,260
if we are talking about silence as a

68
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,120
discipline probably this is not the best

69
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,560
idea in the world to do something like

70
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,110
that so this is an example of bad object

71
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,959
remember keep your mouth shut not only

72
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,530
that the thing is that we all know very

73
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,750
cool stories and we want to impress

74
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,420
isn't our very human nature we want to

75
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,010
impress with our people when we talk to

76
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,080
them eh I know stories I not super

77
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,140
secret stuff this is bad for OPSEC the

78
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,390
objective is that all of you should be

79
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,120
green researchers just another guy

80
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,100
working in the security industry that's

81
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,420
it no need to be a drug star second

82
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,420
lesson OPSEC does not work

83
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,890
retrospectively this is very important

84
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,650
whatever you do today will be there in

85
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,410
the future everything that lives any

86
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,730
trace in terms of pits will be forever

87
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,500
so you should be very very careful with

88
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,500
what you sure electronically so you may

89
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,530
seen that ok we have no enemies I have

90
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,180
no trouble with anyone why should I care

91
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,850
about OPSEC so let's put some context

92
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,190
into our industry we work on cool things

93
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,579
some of these things are strange looks

94
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:13,860
like some people is involved with these

95
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,840
things some of these things could be

96
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,560
perceived as dangerous from the outside

97
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,660
so many people could be interested in

98
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,539
what you in what you know or maybe they

99
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:26,669
could be interested in reaching people

100
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:27,190
that

101
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,900
you know so clearly there is some

102
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,460
interesting in having access to the

103
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,000
information that you manage also let me

104
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,740
tell you actually need this industry for

105
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,340
10 years I say now there is a high

106
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,520
degree of hypocrisy if you think like in

107
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,160
your interior there are like many red

108
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,140
lines no one is speaking about them in

109
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,540
public but some people is crossing them

110
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,550
of course not you not your companies

111
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,740
that some people discussing subject

112
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,500
lines the thing is that the legal

113
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,050
situation is not so clear there are gray

114
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,380
areas and some people is dispersing some

115
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,900
of them but at the end of the day we

116
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,940
think okay we are the good guys we are

117
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,250
helping law enforcement we are working

118
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,350
for the best for improving security of

119
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,720
our customers so we have this sense of

120
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,670
invulnerability I talked to a lot of

121
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,770
people and they all feel like nothing

122
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,070
could happen to me I have no enemies

123
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,570
reality is different I'm not talking

124
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,780
about the ethics is just a reflection

125
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,040
reality is different so just seeing

126
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,230
these questions could your work be

127
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,620
interesting for someone else might be

128
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,350
perceived as dangerous so someone don't

129
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,930
want you to start investigating on

130
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,180
something everything you do is

131
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,669
impeccable or may get you back in the

132
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:50,050
future think about this and also we are

133
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,260
working with law enforcement agencies

134
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,300
and maybe we are the weakest link we

135
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,620
have been talking for years about the

136
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,870
weakest link in security but in terms of

137
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,550
upset if we are working with law

138
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,620
enforcement this guys are trained they

139
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,620
know how to do OPSEC we don't I may wear

140
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,390
the weakest link we are just spreading

141
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,160
information that is important for some

142
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,660
investigations that we are doing right

143
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,510
now with them so under my point of view

144
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,490
the insecurity researchers is putting us

145
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,370
in this situation we are under scrutiny

146
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,400
we are in a group of usual suspects so

147
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,730
many people is interested in as the key

148
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,400
point is that even if we are in this

149
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,040
group don't become the individual of

150
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,850
interest if you reach this point and you

151
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,340
have someone spying on you then it's

152
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,590
game over that's why I remember

153
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,390
you need to be a great guy there's

154
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,240
another guy in the security industry the

155
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,670
best researchers the best analysts are

156
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,600
in the shadows so who are the

157
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,660
adversary's well broadly speaking I have

158
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,290
this I have created this category's this

159
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,840
might change of course that is just an

160
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,210
approximation we have counseled

161
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,900
criminals non-common cyber criminals we

162
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,360
have agencies and we have massive

163
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,420
surveillance or the future because in

164
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,850
this last point remember everything you

165
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,320
do today could hit you back in the

166
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,440
future even if today is not like

167
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,360
investigated maybe it will be in the

168
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,310
future so it could be something against

169
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:29,110
you very important in terms of upset you

170
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,820
should always set up the level of object

171
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,520
that you can really do don't try to be

172
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,040
today or tomorrow like that I'm the

173
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,660
master of object and doing everything

174
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,060
that's in the manuals because you will

175
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,210
fail and if you fail if even worse that

176
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,090
if you don't try any object I will tell

177
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,740
you more about this in one minute so

178
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,470
let's see who are the adversary's that I

179
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,090
was talking about let's see a little bit

180
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,580
what are the motivations and what can we

181
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,340
do about that first of all the common

182
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,890
cyber criminals well these are under my

183
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,380
definition the guys that will are doing

184
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,270
common fraud the script kiddies the

185
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,160
small groups running a small botnets

186
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,260
trying to steal some money not so

187
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,510
sophisticated not so organized not so

188
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,580
many resources but they still could be

189
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,890
dangerous in this case i'll probably

190
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,720
don't see it very well this is an email

191
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,250
that one security to the search should

192
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,590
receive from San guys developing an

193
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,750
exploit kit and they were saying things

194
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,810
like okay you are not the church so you

195
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,420
why do you think you are better than me

196
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,580
black hat people are normal people we

197
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,320
have our interest we have our hobbies

198
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,929
let's just live together why are you

199
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,940
researching on us and things like that

200
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,309
so this race and how is threatening him

201
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:44,650
and it's asking politely to leave them

202
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,220
alone so if they were concerned that

203
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,110
they were being investigated and put in

204
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,660
public here this is another example in

205
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,730
this case instant Portuguese this is

206
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,390
like

207
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,150
more direct actually they are

208
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,520
threatening the the guy receiving this

209
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,850
and that we are going to kill you or

210
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,100
something like this which is not very

211
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,150
nice so the reality is that these groups

212
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,940
probably don't have many resources they

213
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,580
cannot treat you that match they cannot

214
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,270
go to your place and and scare you but

215
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,820
it depends on your situation it depends

216
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,560
where you are based it depends on how

217
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,170
active these groups are so we should be

218
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,240
careful we don't want to deal with these

219
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,680
kind of things are not nice right what

220
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,350
about non-common cybercriminals well in

221
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,170
this case in this group where I

222
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,210
understand these people that is not

223
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,610
their main purpose is not cyber crime

224
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,330
but we still might Istanbul open them

225
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,540
during our investigations for some

226
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,260
reason but these guys are dangerous they

227
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,630
have resources and maybe they didn't

228
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,440
like us like sneaking into their staff

229
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,140
they are organized so we don't want to

230
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,460
deal with these people very much what if

231
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,800
the op SEC is not good what if you are

232
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,110
being discovered like the guy behind one

233
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,240
investigation this is not nice i can

234
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,670
tell you one example in this example i

235
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,730
can told you to one of them is one guy

236
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,120
was investigating some activists he go

237
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,000
discover he was dogs publicly his

238
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,170
employee was really upset he was almost

239
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,820
pirate he wasn't at the end he could

240
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,420
when asleep for three months he was

241
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,460
shamed in public so this is nothing that

242
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,220
you want to happen in another case one

243
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,740
group of guys were investigating another

244
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,320
group of cyber criminals they were

245
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,110
organized ones and thanks to them they

246
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,390
were arrested however the company

247
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,190
publicly announced what happened and the

248
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,020
group who was behind that and these guys

249
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,500
were death threatened and the company

250
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,680
need to pay bodyguards for these guys so

251
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,970
again

252
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:12,339
not a nice at all agencies okay they

253
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,850
have all the resources in the world

254
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,310
again if they are under you you are in

255
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,050
trouble there is not much that you can

256
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,389
do to avoid this situation try not to be

257
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:25,689
the int the guy of interest if you are

258
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:27,550
in the group of interest is ok but try

259
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,920
not to be like the droplets are that

260
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,819
everybody is looking what he is doing

261
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:36,490
still we tend to forget that there are

262
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,519
non technical approach for OPSEC and for

263
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,639
spying on people one of the most useful

264
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,519
ones is the crude Minh if your company

265
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,220
is big enough do you have a lot of

266
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,189
chances that some people in your teams

267
00:11:51,189 --> 00:11:54,790
have been recruited by some agencies so

268
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,680
they have ice inside and they know what

269
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,199
is going on if you are being approached

270
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:01,899
by someone a nice girl or someone in a

271
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:04,389
hotel in a conference like this one hey

272
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,459
I love your world your super interesting

273
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,339
let's talk I want to offer you some job

274
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:12,189
opportunity what do you think I have a

275
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,250
lot of money money is not a problem

276
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,040
don't worry this is how it starts they

277
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,990
can offer you money they can offer you

278
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,959
women they can offer you drugs whatever

279
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,319
you want and once that your recruit you

280
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:28,300
are inside the game is very difficult to

281
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:33,970
go out so just remember that maybe you

282
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,220
have the ant catalog in your mind but

283
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,160
there is also this non technical

284
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,899
approach and this is what we have no

285
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:42,939
idea how to get out of this we are not

286
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:45,779
the spice so if we get to this situation

287
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,720
we're in trouble finally massive

288
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,709
surveillance as I said tons of metadata

289
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:56,319
tons of theta these days is impossible

290
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:59,709
to get rid of all of them happily if you

291
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:01,750
are not an anomaly this is a good thing

292
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,449
so this is the key point here do not

293
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:07,569
being an anomaly do not do anything that

294
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:10,240
can fire the alerts and put the red flag

295
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,040
on you because then there is this

296
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,620
escalation and they will go to another

297
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,220
level to spy to see what you are to him

298
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,830
so it's not only the chances in this

299
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,470
case is also big companies they have a

300
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,020
lot of data just thinkin oh I don't know

301
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,430
Google and also the other companies like

302
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,650
data aggregators that they have leaks

303
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,990
and these leaks get public so i really

304
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,720
have access to this data for instance in

305
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,420
this case this was a data aggregator

306
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,480
room but league website in Russia where

307
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,550
you can look for any people any person

308
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,160
and get personal details from him

309
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,770
probably you know about this Abu Omar

310
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,230
case this is one typical example of

311
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,530
anomalies CIA agents in Italy just

312
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,790
calling at the beginning of the month

313
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,610
then the phone being disconnected they

314
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,100
kidnapped this guy who was suspected of

315
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,720
terrorists Italian police was

316
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,030
investigating they saw that these phone

317
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,530
numbers were only activated at the

318
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,120
beginning of the month then deactivated

319
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,060
the show that they were coming from the

320
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,860
same hotel they went to the hotel

321
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,650
discovered CIA agents undercover agents

322
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,840
and well the full story it was an

323
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,550
anomaly in the telephone so how do we

324
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,280
implement this upset what can we do to

325
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,090
do to improve in here well the most

326
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,950
important thing is not about the tools

327
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,500
it's not about procedure it's about you

328
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,500
you really need to put this inside you

329
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,090
and really saying that I want to do

330
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,980
object and you need to be very very

331
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,270
meticulous it's very very easy to do to

332
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:54,190
 it up so where is the approach this

333
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,830
is just a recommendation but the first

334
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,050
thing that you need to do is situational

335
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,080
awareness you need to think okay what do

336
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,720
I know why do I know who is interested

337
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,280
into that what is the people I talked to

338
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,450
who could be interested in reaching

339
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,030
these people so you need to be conscious

340
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,450
of your situation this is what is called

341
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,150
situational awareness there are followed

342
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,750
following steps for doing that and there

343
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,780
are many types of object approaches for

344
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,450
instance there is the adversary centric

345
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,730
the acid centric or so for centric but

346
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,660
probably the best solution

347
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,519
in my opinion in this operation centric

348
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,910
why because in one operation do you know

349
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:43,060
how many people is there so you can have

350
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,819
like you can try to apply OPSEC in this

351
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,009
environment it's very difficult if you

352
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:49,779
go tomorrow to your big company with

353
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:52,899
10,000 employees and say okay we want to

354
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:55,480
apply upset what can we do is almost

355
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,250
impossible to that but in a small

356
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,319
operation in a small group this is the

357
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:01,180
way to start in my opinion this is the

358
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,509
best approach so what to do in a group

359
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:06,910
all of you probably are working in

360
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,889
groups it's more difficult to play

361
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:10,980
groups upsetting in groups that

362
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,689
personally that is necessary because we

363
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:15,459
are working in groups and also we don't

364
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:17,620
depend on ourselves we also depend on

365
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,569
other people who is talking to us and

366
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:23,579
who is helping in the investigations so

367
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:26,040
things that you need to think about is

368
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,050
externally who to trust how to

369
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,420
communicate to these people where is the

370
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,870
current chain in this case I recommend

371
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,550
to have something like an obstacle

372
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,370
officer in the company in the group and

373
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,769
what are the protocols in case that

374
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:43,779
something happened this is like the

375
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:47,740
basics internally the best thing is to

376
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,860
compare common information so you only

377
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,269
give the information that is necessary

378
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:55,029
to different parts of the group and try

379
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:57,759
it for this information not to cross

380
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,050
into this group's training and shaming

381
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,020
shaming is important for instance in

382
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,609
some big companies they are doing this

383
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:10,089
actively so they tell to the people okay

384
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,980
try to shame the others with the public

385
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,720
information that they are living and

386
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,169
this is a way for proactively make

387
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,390
people think about that and shaming

388
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,130
inside of the group is not dangerous but

389
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,689
they will realize of how many

390
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:24,429
information they are making public that

391
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:27,939
decision so it's a good way it's very

392
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:30,340
important to set the send sensitive

393
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,640
business sensitiveness of information if

394
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,010
you don't know how sensitive is one

395
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,100
information how can you apply up sick on

396
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,980
it maybe something is like vital please

397
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,399
do not share with anyone but you don't

398
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,830
know about that so you should always

399
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,580
take them for

400
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,070
mission in say how sensitive it is I

401
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,960
have different procedures depending on

402
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,740
how sensitive the information is this is

403
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,200
a tip here be careful with your language

404
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,250
remember the first rule of upset shut up

405
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,510
okay silence so also this applies

406
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,149
internally if you send an email to your

407
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:13,870
boss a I totally hacked this side haha

408
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,960
these guys are so lame this can beat you

409
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,289
back in the future just say I did the

410
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:24,429
job something like that be smart no need

411
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:28,169
to brag remember what I told you before

412
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:31,419
recruitment keep in mind that maybe some

413
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:33,970
of the guys in your in your group are

414
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,190
already recruit and they are working for

415
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,740
some agencies what to do in this case

416
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,100
well from this movie with different

417
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,039
information and see which one is leaking

418
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,830
information but to be honest I have no

419
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:51,419
idea what to do with that situation

420
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,669
about using different identities this is

421
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:58,059
like one of the first recommendations

422
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:01,149
for OPSEC yeah use different identities

423
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:03,610
when you are on IRC when you are in this

424
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,730
underground forum of course I mean you

425
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,409
are not saying a I'm the security

426
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:09,789
researcher and I'm inside this

427
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:11,260
underground forum trying to find out

428
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,950
what you are guys doing but this is

429
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,279
extremely difficult you have different

430
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:20,590
identities and you want to keep them

431
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,380
let's say four months four years and you

432
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,230
want them to be solid this is extremely

433
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,809
difficult and at some point the chances

434
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:31,779
are that you are going to it up so

435
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:34,480
try to avoid this situation if possible

436
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,210
if it is not possible the golden rule is

437
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,340
to avoid cross contamination between

438
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,480
identities and if you remember before I

439
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,580
told you that if you apply that object

440
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,620
is worse than not applying it at all

441
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,320
just imagine that you have one super

442
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,750
secret email account that you share only

443
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,789
with a bunch of people where you are

444
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:56,980
communicating to share like super sticky

445
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,980
stuff and at some point there is

446
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,440
cross-contamination

447
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,690
so someone knows that you have this

448
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,669
email address the guys who is

449
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:07,710
investigating you can forget about the

450
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,929
other millions of emails that you have

451
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:12,929
and focus only on this one because it's

452
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:15,120
where you have the good stuff so in this

453
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,820
case applying bad OPSEC is worse than

454
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,450
not applying it at all so this is a very

455
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,789
quick review of the tools that are

456
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:28,320
necessary these days for a pion OPSEC so

457
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,210
what do you need what do you need for

458
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,720
upset during the encryption some form of

459
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,809
you need email instant messaging phone

460
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:40,620
you need internet and some mini-moon

461
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,159
subset of real-world skills so let's see

462
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,009
first encryption the bad thing about

463
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:49,279
encryption is that there aren't some

464
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,620
inherent flaws for instance if you get

465
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,169
compromised at some point your secret

466
00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:58,019
key or your password all the data that

467
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:00,509
was encrypted in the past is not

468
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,419
revealed the more time that you are

469
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,309
using this key the more time that you

470
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:08,639
are using the same encryption method the

471
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:10,590
better the bigger the chances that this

472
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,330
will happen so this is like something

473
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,580
that could happen with encryption but

474
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,210
you know about this obviously encrypt

475
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,820
everything still is necessary having an

476
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,549
anti-corrosion partition incredible yeah

477
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:28,379
this is nice something that you can

478
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:31,500
apply so let's take a look too true

479
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,669
creep to clip is the the tool of choice

480
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:40,529
by everyone for encryption you know that

481
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:42,629
there is this project auditing truecrypt

482
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:46,440
the first thing that they say is that

483
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,649
they have not found evidence of any back

484
00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:52,080
door or intentional flows which is a

485
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,019
good thing so we are all of us like okay

486
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:58,049
to creep this looking solid and then

487
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:01,799
this happened you remember i think it

488
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:05,309
was in june sure now yeah well the guys

489
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:07,529
have true caves say you know stop using

490
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:11,159
to creep is not secure instead of that

491
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:14,520
use BitLocker what really what

492
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,350
here nobody knows but at this point on

493
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,570
everybody said okay to pleat should we

494
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:27,210
use it or not there is still the second

495
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,060
or third phase of the audit sorry the

496
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,720
second phase of the audit the for market

497
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,530
analysis according to the analysis so

498
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,690
far of troop clip according to the audit

499
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,390
it's okay to use it now there is like

500
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,880
this repository with trusted code of

501
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,190
true clip from the guys who are doing

502
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,580
the script analysis so I think that we

503
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,900
can use it but you know this scene is

504
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,760
really strange we don't know what

505
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,010
happened I would say let's keep using to

506
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:03,090
creep what about the mail email is in

507
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,680
terms of object is truly bad there are a

508
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,980
lot of traces a lot of metadata even if

509
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,830
what you have is encrypted well metadata

510
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:17,310
is there and there is not a good

511
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:21,180
solution I got against the id10t problem

512
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,450
or idiot problem this problem is that

513
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,520
you send an email to someone included

514
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,060
with PGP and he danced replies like

515
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,280
thank you without encrypting the

516
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,380
information and copying all the

517
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,150
information from the previous message in

518
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,010
the email so it's not clear and you are

519
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,500
like what and this has happened to me

520
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,520
and not internally in the company web

521
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,100
with law enforcement and with certs and

522
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,590
with people who should be super train in

523
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,950
terms of security so once that you short

524
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,060
information you lose the control of it

525
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,460
if you are using external servers for

526
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,510
email is even worse now gmail is

527
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,090
implementing PGP but just think about

528
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,940
what happened with lava mail think about

529
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,540
proton mail how it got cut the paypal

530
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,780
account so it's not easy to get a good

531
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,540
provider these days in my opinion is

532
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,670
much better to use instant messaging

533
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:25,140
than email with OTP at least it will be

534
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,980
deleted

535
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,429
when you finish the conversation about

536
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:32,610
instant messaging add in a pigeon the

537
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,370
crypto is okay there are some mineral

538
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,309
issues but just remember like the log

539
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:40,590
files and all these things is not that

540
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,870
about the tool how secure is the tool is

541
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,270
also how we use it and we will see one

542
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:51,230
big example now this guy was part of

543
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:56,160
anonymous was arrested because of Savile

544
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,700
who got arrested previously he was an

545
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,730
informant from for the FBI once he got

546
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,760
arrested and he just tricked this guy

547
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,010
into IRC sorry into encrypted

548
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,750
communication just to say all the alias

549
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,549
that he was using all the nicknames and

550
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:17,640
he got arrested so again speaking to

551
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,790
match he was full but this is how

552
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,160
agencies work remember this is not about

553
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,260
the tool is not how good is the crypto

554
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,480
is about these small things and this is

555
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,820
the most difficult thing to be aware of

556
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,640
all these small problems so what about

557
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,840
tour you remember what happened to this

558
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,630
gentleman here is the harbour bond have

559
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,360
you heard this story this guy was in

560
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,549
Harvard he didn't want to go to an exam

561
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:47,520
so he said hey there is a bomb in the

562
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,160
University and he was using tor but it

563
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,110
was very easy to correlate who was a guy

564
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,500
using tor in the internal network at the

565
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,460
very same time that they got the bomb

566
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,250
threat so thanks to correlation they got

567
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,500
the guy he admitted he just sent it

568
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,630
because he wanted he didn't want to go

569
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,450
to the exam and yeah well he's in

570
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:13,830
trouble now what happens to tor tor is

571
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:17,130
okay against common cybercriminals this

572
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,350
again it's okay against some non common

573
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,270
cybercriminals is totally up

574
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,970
against agencies even against some

575
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,820
investigations my recommendation is do

576
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,130
not use store if you are doing something

577
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,220
highly sensitive but you store the rest

578
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,500
of the time let me explain if you are

579
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,990
using tor for something super sensitive

580
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,750
then all the output nodes are

581
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,430
log in everything that you are doing and

582
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,110
there are many people have been eyes

583
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:46,200
over these output nodes so it's not a

584
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,580
good idea they are providing extra

585
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,370
information of what you are doing but

586
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,780
against commerce have a criminal's

587
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,440
estatura use it by default so just be

588
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,410
aware who will be checking what you are

589
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,840
doing in tour but correlation is very

590
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,960
easy very easy way to get who is behind

591
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,740
one tour connection also problems with

592
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,210
tour this was published in the July

593
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,450
third 13th of July the store security

594
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,060
advisory probably you have heard about

595
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,780
this but for six months tor users were

596
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,470
not secure and hidden services inside

597
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,600
the Tor network has been compromised

598
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,940
that nobody knows what's the extent of

599
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,630
this they are still investigating so tor

600
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:36,060
tor is in trouble but it's still use it

601
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,240
for things that you use what we do but

602
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,820
not for super secretive stuff phone have

603
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,670
phone is a nightmare do not use phones

604
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,130
is the recommendation that everybody

605
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,130
will use it so just ignore it the thing

606
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,990
is that who is having control over the

607
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,430
metal eight of the phones law

608
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,880
enforcement some agencies that's it so

609
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,860
it's not that bad depending on what you

610
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,650
want to hide but in terms of op SEC is a

611
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,850
real nightmare so the only

612
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,190
recommendation is to have like burner

613
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:12,470
phones and just chain phone often and

614
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:15,360
don't up things like I have some

615
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,640
information in my phone that is saying

616
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,320
the opposite that the information they

617
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,180
have in my laptop just imagine that you

618
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,280
are being stopped in some airport and

619
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,650
you are claiming to be someone else and

620
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,270
then in your phone you have all the

621
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,850
contacts and things like that these are

622
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,980
the small details that we need to

623
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,620
consider this is this guide of how to

624
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:40,050
use the phone by the G GCHQ and the

625
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:43,320
jihadist and it's mostly the same you

626
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,150
will see this later when we share the

627
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,610
presentation I don't think I have time

628
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,790
to go over this now what about the real

629
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,789
world well the key point is

630
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:56,639
to impress people silence remember and

631
00:28:56,639 --> 00:29:01,049
don't be impressed it's a simple rule

632
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:04,440
that is against our human nature what if

633
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,109
you are required by a law enforcement

634
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:12,389
well in this case remember shut up code

635
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:15,210
your lawyer and that's it but do not

636
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,330
emit things for free be collaborative be

637
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,690
nice but called your lawyer and solve

638
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,519
the situation just don't incriminate

639
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:29,580
yourself when you traveling the

640
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,190
recommendation is always have your stuff

641
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:35,309
with you and if possible have a laptop

642
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:39,149
for traveling have phone for traveling

643
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:41,309
don't have like all your sensitive stuff

644
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:43,799
with you when you are going abroad just

645
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:45,299
keep it in your office or whatever it's

646
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,639
safe and have another thing for going

647
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:51,929
around and pennies pennies I heard it's

648
00:29:51,929 --> 00:29:54,210
a very good thing for knowing if someone

649
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,299
is in your bedroom when you are out of

650
00:29:56,299 --> 00:29:59,220
out of the hotel you just put a lot of

651
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,710
pennies everywhere and when you get back

652
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,129
you check if they are in the same place

653
00:30:04,129 --> 00:30:07,019
initially never try it but I heard this

654
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:10,200
is a good thing so in summary object is

655
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,690
very hard the good news is that you

656
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,279
don't really need to be a spy you don't

657
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,080
really need to do this perfect object

658
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,029
but what I wanted with this presentation

659
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:20,789
is for you to be aware the world that we

660
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:22,859
are living is dangerous in many sense

661
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:25,349
for us for our families is dangerous for

662
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:28,200
our career is dangerous for an employer

663
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,749
so just be aware of this it's not so

664
00:30:30,749 --> 00:30:33,149
hard to employ a little bit of object

665
00:30:33,149 --> 00:30:35,940
and this could be a star like for a

666
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,909
brighter future so far this is something

667
00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:40,919
that will benefit the whole community if

668
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:43,769
we all give up sick we will not be an

669
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:45,720
exception if some one of you are doing

670
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,700
this right now maybe he has a red flag

671
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,159
over him like a this guy is suspicious

672
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,529
lately his everything he's sending is

673
00:30:52,529 --> 00:30:54,989
encrypted this is very strange but if we

674
00:30:54,989 --> 00:30:58,080
all of us are doing the same this is not

675
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,879
an anomaly remember where I told you

676
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:02,070
about anomalies so let's say sorry to

677
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,980
gain by ourselves and remember is more

678
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,990
important to be meticulous than the

679
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,960
tools that we use and remember that you

680
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,020
should only use the object that you can

681
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,929
really apply not try to be tomorrow

682
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:18,179
super perfect spy this will not happen

683
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:21,600
and will be a bad thing so thank you

684
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,929
very much that's all from my side time

685
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:26,450
yeah okay thank you very much

686
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,320

687
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,909
