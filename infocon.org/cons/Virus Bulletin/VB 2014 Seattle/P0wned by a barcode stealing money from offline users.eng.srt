115
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:13,070
your smartphone this is a user scanning

116
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:19,550
a barcode and being disbelieved but the

117
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,039
most interesting part of a bolito is the

118
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:25,820
day I give you the 44 digit ID field in

119
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,169
the bar called the

120
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:29,930
barcode represents exactly what what is

121
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,289
in the ID field and this ID field it has

122
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:36,800
a lot of information it for example has

123
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,279
the unique number that points there's a

124
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,830
clickbank account that we receive the

125
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,620
amount when the bullet was paid we

126
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,610
receive the money it has for example

127
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,340
data of the bank that issued the bullet

128
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,159
oh they know so no middle it's the our

129
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,740
number it's a number to identify the

130
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,569
bank account that we receive the money

131
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:03,439
it has some checks and data and also the

132
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,589
value and the due date when the user

133
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:07,879
need to pay it

134
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,479
well what Brazilian bad guys are doing

135
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:14,349
they are invalidating the bar code

136
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:17,930
adding some blank spaces here so the bar

137
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,889
code can't be read and changing de ID

138
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:22,610
field

139
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,759
this is what Brazilian our are doing

140
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,219

141
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:31,310

143
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:37,639
another bank account controlled by the

144
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,159
bad guy and this account will receive

145
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,520
the money when the user paid and of

146
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,310
course changing the Rio bar code for

147
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,029
another one injected by the mower that's

148
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:52,490
what they are doing I'm sure you are you

149
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,300
saw it in the media in June when RSA

150
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,360

151
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,169
about Brazilian boletus I'll talk about

152
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:05,449
details about your RSA publication in a

153
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:06,979
few minutes

154
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:13,339
well this is the more simple the more

155
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:16,009

156
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:18,710

157
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,289
injections in the correct way that's it

158
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:24,589
this is the mower in injecting oops

159
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:29,330
sorry ejecting data in the web browser

160
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,690
sessions and the browser communicates

161
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,039
with a CNC and there tomorrow received

162
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,630
some data to in

163
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,149
in the bullet when it's generated in the

164
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:44,360
browser because most of the bullets are

165
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,750
generated online today or using some

166
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,310
software they use a browser to render in

167
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:55,790
HTML and generate this bullet oh so it's

168
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,420
it's like spy I it's web section and

169
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,420
this is the CNC the mother sent a

170
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,569
request to a server and received this

171
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:08,209
response this is very interesting the

172
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:10,730
first sample of bullet tomorrow we found

173
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,750
in the wild

174
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,259
in April 2013 one year more than one

175
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:18,920
year so a colleague from Moscow wrote me

176
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,410
a message asking me hey Fabio we have

177
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,319
here a Brazilian mower we know it's

178
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:27,139
mower but it's strange because it

179
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:30,380
communicates with a CNC in all the mower

180
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,079
receives it's a big line full of numbers

181
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:37,130
and nobody knows what is it what is it

182
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,800
and when I saw them our analyzing the

183
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,459
flower there the file I realize it it's

184
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:46,610
a mower that change boletos because this

185
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,100
this format of number it's typical

186
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,790
typical from from Brazilian mower that

187
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,310
change boletos and this is this is the

188
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,689
images of some CNC some of them answer

189
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:03,259
or send to the mower not only the new

190
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:06,920
number but also the new barcode or some

191
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,709
simple just a big line of the new number

192
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:15,439
that will be injected in the bollito and

193
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:17,630
of course this is the control panel of

194
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,110
the mower use it by the bad guy it has

195
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,639
the date the hour they all the ID field

196
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:28,009
use it by the balletto and the new one

197
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:31,970
that was injected by the mower it has

198
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,540
the valley and the origin where this

199
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,939
bullet was generated the bad guy want to

200
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:44,350
know it to do some quality control where

201
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,019
the users are or in which website they

202
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:51,529
are to generate this bullet this is what

203
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:52,320
you've heard

204
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,570
the heiress a story but there is more

205
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,840
much much much more this is what era say

206
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,720
publishes in their paper in June what's

207
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,450
more we are living in interesting days

208
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,390
in Brazil interesting times because we

209
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,230
are living a big migration of the

210
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,570
Brazilian cybercrime most of the

211
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,700
Brazilian bad guys that work with trajan

212
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,520
bankers you probably know it I talked

213
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,010
several times about it when publishes a

214
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,500
lot of articles they are moving all

215
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,440
their infrastructure they are moving all

216
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,770
their efforts to attack boletos why

217
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,170
because it's more profitable of course

218
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,930
they are stealing a lot of money and we

219
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,420
can find crime of our kids that

220
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,880
attacking bollito they are available

221
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,970
over Facebook you can buy it really

222
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:47,340
cheap costing only $250 it's very cheap

223
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,340
here is the image of a bad guy selling

224
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,780
this crimeware kit that changes boletus

225
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,600
over facebook and they are really

226
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,200
quickly adopting new techniques to

227
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,930
spread them our and in fact more users

228
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,680
so forget about that old and biggie

229
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,190
Delfy Trojans everybody here knows the

230
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,170
Brazilian bad guys create really big

231
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,860
trojan bankers generally in Delft you're

232
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,040
Delphi and they evolve it they are not

233
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,970
using anymore they evolve it and why

234
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,000
they evolve it this is really something

235
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,880
interesting in the Brazilian scene and

236
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,660
here we have a mesh of a control panel

237
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:38,790
used for a babka it was from 2012 they

238
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,480
use it this kind of panel to control the

239
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,340
machines infected with Trajan bankers

240
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,570
but right now this infrastructure was

241
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,720
adapted to attack boletos so they are

242
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,000
using the same tricks the same attacks

243
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,730
to target pollitos and why they are

244
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,900
evolving because they are in constant

245
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,160
cooperation or in constant contact with

246
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,030
bad guys from

247
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,270
Eastern Europe mainly bad guys from

248
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,270
Russia Ukraine and other

249
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:15,060
russian-speaking countries this for

250
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,190
example is a Brazilian bad guy posting a

251
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,790
message in the Russian underground forum

252
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,550
asking for data and they are posting in

253
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,470
Russian of course using all on

254
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,640
translator but they are in constant

255
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,980
contact with this bad guys from Europe

256
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,350
and here another Brazilian bad guy

257
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,640
selling an ATM our or here another

258
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,820
Brazilian bad guy open to business and

259
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,780
this contact with European bad guys may

260
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,330
the Brazilian bad guys evolve a lot they

261
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,130
are creating more attacks more

262
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,130
sophisticated malware and of course this

263
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,830
is natural in the in the cyber crime

264
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,280
scene and this is what they are doing

265
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,320
but they are not only cooperating

266
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,970
Brazilian bad guys are using the

267
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,430
infrastructure from the European bad

268
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,510
guys we have for example here some CNC

269
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:16,700
of the bullet or our hosted in Russia

270
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,520
hosted in hosting service bulletproofing

271
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,060
hosting services or here if this is a

272
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,330
fake bullet web site created to

273
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,020
recalculate the bullet hole and all

274
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,540
hosted in Russia in bulletproofing

275
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,630
service or this bad guy this Brazilian

276
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,500
bad guys don't listen to Cristal he

277
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,750
registered 14 domains and hosted

278
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:47,430
everything in Russia everything in

279
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,590
Russia so they are using the

280
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,210
infrastructure of the bad guys from

281
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,430
Europe or this one this is a fake

282
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,520
website also that promises to

283
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,060
recalculate a bolito but it's hosted in

284
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,770
Russia as well so this cooperation with

285
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,370
European bad guys their impact the

286
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,190
result in the Brazilian our is they are

287
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,320
evolving they are adopting new

288
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,320
techniques in their Mauer of course this

289
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,590
is natural and we have some other clear

290
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:22,050
of this cooperation Brazilian bad guys

291
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,029
they are adopting the same techniques

292
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:28,950
used by Zeus we saw in the TV the TV

293
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,680
video in the beginning the police are

294
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,920
wrongly calling it as Zeus it's not

295
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,260
exactly this use as we know it in Europe

296
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,920
that target Europe in the US but this

297
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,160
contact with European bad guys

298
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,380
the result is they are adopting these

299
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,600
new techniques for example they are

300
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,480
using encrypted payloads share it with a

301
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,600
32-bit key and compress it by the leap

302
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,320
and using some extensions of no magic

303
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,240
table files such as JMP bck ENC and the

304
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,910
payload downloaded by by the dropper

305
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:10,080
it's totally encrypted such this one

306
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,250
this is a g jnp file totally encrypted

307
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,920
why they are doing it to bypass filters

308
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,860
and so on it's the same technique zero

309
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,010
sorry are using in Europe in US and

310
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:27,450
after they the files are downloaded its

311
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,200
decrypted and so you can see here the

312
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,650
normal is active of file this is a

313
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,920
technique they're copying from Zeus

314
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,330
another interesting technique they are

315
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,640
using they are doing may in the middle

316
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:47,990
using fiddler fiddler it's well known to

317
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,920
probably use it by a lot of guys here

318
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,930
they are installing the fiddler fiddler

319
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,020
core in the infected machine and they

320
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,470
are using me in the middle because they

321
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,920
want to change boletus generated in ssl

322
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:10,109
pages in HTTP HTTPS pages so this is the

323
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:14,970
mower the mower is ready to change

324
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,189
boletus and this is the fiddler core

325
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:20,220
they are installing some ssl

326
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,290
certificates in the system because they

327
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,150
want to do this man in the middle attack

328
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,939
and they want to change boletus

329
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,550
generated in HTTP PS

330
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,250
they are evolving they are copying these

331
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,410
techniques from Europe in quickly

332
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,630
adopting number zero but another

333
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,620
interesting fact about these attacks is

334
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,690
the attacks against network devices I

335
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,670
presented here 2012

336
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,490
a series of a series of attacks against

337
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:52,720
DSL modems they did in 2011 and 2012

338
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,320
where more than 4 million DSL modems

339
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,650
were attacked in Brazil they are doing a

340
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,890
remote attack change changing the DNS

341
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,800
configuration of these DSL modems this

342
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,520
is - a big problem in Brazil there are

343
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,510
some DSL modems still vulnerable and

344
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,060
they are still doing it they do a remote

345
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,650
attack against the network devices

346
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,340
change the DNS settings and there they

347
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,460
are using this DNS a connection to

348
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,270
distribute bully to Mauer so here we

349
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:32,620
have the URLs of popular services such

350
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,860
goggle Facebook and other Brazilian

351
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,590
websites in in all of the inter porting

352
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,650
to I park are pointing to acceptable

353
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,110
files that of course do not exist but

354
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,900
exist in the machines and the network

355
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,840
devices that was infected that was

356
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,480
changed by the power and a new DNS was

357
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,840
configured on it when they are not

358
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,450
attacking the network devices they are

359
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:04,000
doing DNS poisoning against the SPS we

360
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,210
have a big big ESPN Brasil called net

361
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,870
viewer probably all the weekends they

362
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,290
are victims of DNS poisoning attacks

363
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,430
they have 12 million customers and a lot

364
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,650
of customers are reporting they got

365
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:25,260
redirected to phishing pages or

366
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,580
fraudulent pages that promised to

367
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,000
generate new boletos of course these

368
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,810
belittles generated by this site this

369
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:39,540
website it's fake totally fake or

370
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,770
sometimes the user are redirected to a

371
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,650
pages and this fraudulent Polito is

372
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,800
generated and if the user believes on it

373
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,360
print and pay the user will be sending

374
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,210
the money to a bad guys account well but

375
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,150
that's more there's more much more

376
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,940
they're targeting networked devices and

377
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,610
doing massive web-based attacks against

378
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,670
home routers using multi zhing

379
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,190
techniques changing DNS settings and

380
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,920
redirecting to fake boletus for example

381
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,470
we have here our really popular media

382
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,250
outlet website from Brazil stop down and

383
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,890
they injected in the website some

384
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,860
scripts they script try to guess the

385
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,160
password of your home router of course

386
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,670
trying the default password but if the

387
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,040
script can't guess the password it will

388
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,460
prompt a box asking you to inform the

389
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,010
password of your home router it's an

390
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:50,470
attack we know as I forget the name

391
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,770
drive-by farming it's a really well

392
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,540
known attack called drive-by farming

393
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,150
they are using it in Brazil when they

394
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,880
are not compromising popular websites

395
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,440
they are using multi zhing such this

396
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,140
advertisement they injected in on it

397
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,110
script that tried to guess the password

398
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,820
of your home router and if it if it

399
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:20,030
succeed the script will change the DNS

400
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,520
and of course if the bad guy controls

401
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,730
the DNS it can redirect you to a

402
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,550
phishing page or a fake page this is the

403
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,730
script this is the script that try

404
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,390
default passwords so could imagine a lot

405
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,690
of ham users that don't have a password

406
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,270
configure and a hammer router or are

407
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,210
using the default password if the user

408
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:48,380
visit a simple web page the DNS is

409
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,790
changed in the network device and the

410
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,770
user got redirected to phishing

411
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:58,429
or to fake pages mainly pages of bullet

412
00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:01,730
so it's not only Mauer they are using a

413
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,570
more online approach aiming to reach

414
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,940
more people and infected more people and

415
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:14,179
still more money well most of them our

416
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:16,580
the bullet um our effects internet

417
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,809
explorer installing a Pho and BHO you do

418
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:23,300
everything will do the injection but we

419
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,400
know Chrome and Firefox are very popular

420
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,850
in in the world it it happens the same

421
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:32,090
in Brazil so they are targeting Google

422
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,880
Chrome as well what's the best way to do

423
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,280
it what's the best way to attack Google

424
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,300
Chrome using a malicious extensions with

425
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,720
the blessings of Google why not put

426
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,220
these malicious extensions in the

427
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,530
official chrome store well this is

428
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:51,170
exactly what they are doing they are

429
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,679
putting some malicious extensions in the

430
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:56,690
official chrome store for example this

431
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:00,050
one promises bundles to your Skype

432
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:04,309
account or this one call it Chrome

433
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:08,320
extensions monitor or this one to read

434
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,410
documents online it's all fake but it's

435
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,420
all hosted in the official store and

436
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,390
it's incredible how easy they are

437
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,809
hosting these malicious extensions there

438
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:24,080
I found each week I found one or two

439
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,260
it's really easy for bad guys to do it

440
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,600
what their malicious extension do

441
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,590
exactly change boletos and it's so easy

442
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:37,940
to do it but we found also some malware

443
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,559
that are planning to change the way

444
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,820
chrome do with extensions we have for

445
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,010
example this malware trojan banker clear

446
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,820
wind not a it's prepared to active the

447
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,360
developer mode in Google Chrome and

448
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,390
doing that the mower can stand it can

449
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,710
install any

450
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,539
extension in the Google Chrome doing the

451
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:08,090
activating the developer mode in the in

452
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,720
the users computer and Firefox is target

453
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,380
was well they are also creating

454
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:21,169
malicious extensions from Firefox okay

455
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:24,260
another interesting approach are fake

456
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,399
websites sponsored links and they are

457
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:31,159
using it so to promote some fraudulent

458
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:34,520
websites that promise to recalculate a

459
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,450
bolito or to issue a copy of the bully

460
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,029
to you you have it they are buying

461
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:45,110
sponsored links on Google generally the

462
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,779
words they are buying the word bully too

463
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:50,270
so you can do assertion Google the first

464
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,539
result is a fraudulent website and it's

465
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:55,460
interesting because it also appear and

466
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,029
being in other search engines if the

467
00:24:59,029 --> 00:25:01,580
user believes the user will enter in a

468
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,760
really beautiful website made with a

469
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,850
very professional design and the website

470
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,580
promises you to recalculate a bolito

471
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,340
because a bolito has a due date if you

472
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,590
don't pay it you need to recalculate -

473
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,710
hey issue and you belittle this is what

474
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,049
the website are promising but of course

475
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:23,870
it's entirely fake and the new bully -

476
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:28,640
generated by the website it's fake it

477
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,590
will redirect the payment to another

478
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:35,240
account well really a common question I

479
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,909
receive it from a lot of people how much

480
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:42,740
money was stolen how many victims you've

481
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,529
heard from the RSA paper this amount of

482
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:50,120
money almost 4 billion dollars it's a

483
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,559
big number in in reais Brazilian reais

484
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:00,590
it's bigger it's almost 9 billions whoa

485
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,320
it's a big number in this big number was

486
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,659
published in New York Times Brian Krebs

487
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:09,710
and a lot of media outlets but I'm sorry

488
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,630
to tell you it's wrong it's bad man

489
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,809
it's bad man from RSA I will show you

490
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:21,400
why the biggest Brazilian bank is Banco

491
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,039
do Brasil is there the biggest their

492
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:28,809
profits in 2013 was six point six point

493
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:32,190
six billion dollars so could you imagine

494
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,679
bad guys installing them half of the

495
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,309
money of entire bank could you imagine

496
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:42,809
of course this number is really big

497
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:47,470
exaggerated and I'm sorry RSA it was a

498
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:51,429
Bigfoot a big Bigfoot and I'll show you

499
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:54,309
more why this is bad man this is a

500
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:58,150
control panel use it by the bad guy to

501
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,750
know how many bullet us was how many

502
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,750
bullets were changing and its really

503
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,510
come on in the in the in this control

504
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,990
panel find duplicate duplicated in price

505
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:15,520
such this one or testing in tries such

506
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,530
this one one two three four one two

507
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,150
three four one two three one two three

508
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,049
one two three

509
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:23,860
I don't know maybe these decent Rhys who

510
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,860
were made by our small researcher or by

511
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,190
even by the bad guy testing the mower if

512
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:34,000
the connection with the CCR okay so what

513
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,330
are se deep they calculated all these

514
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,240
values of the control panel they they

515
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,600
get access and the result was that big

516
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,659
number almost four billion dollars it's

517
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:53,380
incorrect I'm sorry are say this is not

518
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,890
the this is not the way but how much

519
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,809
money they are strolling in fact we

520
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:00,549
don't know we don't have an official

521
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:02,530
number and of course the banks are not

522
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,460
talking or not revealing how much money

523
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,280
they are losing with these frauds they

524
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,710
they don't talk we still don't have an

525
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:15,070
official number so we don't know we know

526
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,890
there are some cases were they are

527
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,530
stealing a lot of money for example from

528
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,570
that businesswoman we saw in the video

529
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,540
in the beginning but most of the attacks

530
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,650
are

531
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,590
small valerie's small Valerie's do not

532
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,950
be so we still don't know how much money

533
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:36,970
they are they are they are stealing from

534
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,210
the users well and to finish my

535
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,020
presentation

536
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,240
how about protection we are suggesting

537
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,600
to companies to generate boletus in PDF

538
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,610
files because until right now

539
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,700
destruction can't change boletus

540
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,910
generator in PDF mode so this is what we

541
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,700
are suggesting to companies to do right

542
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,710
now and for home users we are suggesting

543
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,080
a protection for example in our product

544
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,530
we have the safe money technology that

545
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:09,420
can generate boletos in a safe way and

546
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,100
even if the machine is infected the

547
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,800
mower can't inject code in the browser

548
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,420
session generating a bolito in a secure

549
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,380
way well that's it I'm publishing more

550
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,330
details about this attack soon at

551
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,270
Sakura's calm and I'm hoping for

552
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,890
questions right now thank you

553
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,810
Thank You Fabio actually we're out of

554
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,010
time we don't have time for questions

555
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,290
but join me in thanking in thank you

556
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,649
