1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:03,389
okay and welcome to the last session

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:05,700
before lunch and we're going to learn

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,129
about our favorite pastime on Twitter

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,690
excuse me I'm Jonathan Oliver and this

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,020
is papa Harris will be talking about

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:28,890
spam and abuse on Twitter today so this

7
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,159
talk is on behalf of trend micro and

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,340
also Deakin University and would like to

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,190
acknowledge a government grant from the

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,629
australian government supported this

11
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,890
work so first of all I'd like to start

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,620
talking about the motivation what we see

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,239
is that Twitter accounts are actually

14
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,550
worth more than credit card accounts

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,059
this was released earlier this year that

16
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,000
by the RAND Corporation doing research

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,440
discovering that on the underground

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,080
economy Twitter accounts are actually

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,640
quite valuable and this is true in

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,140
general of social network accounts so

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,780
that provides a major incentive for

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,150
spammers and cyber criminals to be

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,159
actively working on these social

24
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,670
networks because they're working in

25
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,689
valuable currency on the underground

26
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,310
economy so there's a range of abuse that

27
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,060
we investigated we were focusing on

28
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,400
voluminous abuse that was a significant

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,070
volume we're not looking at isolated

30
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,880
incident and there was traditional spam

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,119
where people are just selling junk very

32
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,100
similar to email spam so we all know

33
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:51,090
this there was a range of more far more

34
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,579
malicious tweets that were offering free

35
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,280
movies cracked software in this case

36
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,040
antivirus no keys that's not

37
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,450
particularly am desirable in anyone's

38
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,330
well and these were part of volume of

39
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,459
spam attacks that would I will let's

40
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:17,400
move on in addition we saw Twitter

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,510
fishing this exploited particular facet

42
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,650
of the Twitter social network it had a

43
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,390
higher click-through rate than you'll

44
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,060
see in traditional email phishing it was

45
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,900
able to exploit direct messaging to

46
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,580
achieve these higher click-through rates

47
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,340
what happened here was you got very

48
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,110
simple messages from your friends and if

49
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,519
you clicked on it you'd timed out and

50
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,140
people thought I clicked on a link and

51
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,099
Twitter I've timed out I'll low just log

52
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:00,209
in again at that point your fish we also

53
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,329
fought saw follower scams here the point

54
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:06,299
is that users would treat in providing

55
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,849
access to their Twitter accounts that

56
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,480
were very undesirable in particular that

57
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,889
be tricked into providing access to post

58
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:19,590
their tweets and to follow other people

59
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,139
what they thought they were buying was

60
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:25,290
followers but in actual fact that we're

61
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,440
giving extensive access to their

62
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,819
accounts so here we quickly just

63
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,910
described the depth of the study that we

64
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,290
performed we um got a very large data

65
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,760
set about half a billion tweets from

66
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,959
certain velocity there was a two-week

67
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:52,650
period where we got approximately half a

68
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,660
billion tweets we found 33 million of

69
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,720
them which we believe with very high

70
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,669
confidence and we'll explain why in the

71
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:05,130
talk that these were spam and other

72
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,970
forms of malicious activity and this

73
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,690
resulted in a five point eight percent

74
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,840
spam rank for tweets with URLs

75
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,238
will note that this was during a period

76
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,910
of very high spam activity on Twitter

77
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,240
and that subsequent to this the spam

78
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,729
rate has come down considerably here's a

79
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:32,310
tool that's particularly useful for

80
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,310
confirming that these large outbreaks

81
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,560
are in fact spam because don't forget

82
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,990
we've got half and being tweets we

83
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,490
cannot carefully go through half a

84
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,639
million tweets manually so the aspect

85
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,360
here is that it is traditional practice

86
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,090
for avoiding blacklists avoiding

87
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,880
detection for the spammers to be using

88
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,610
round robins so there they use a round

89
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,160
robin approach so in that they've got

90
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,560
various compromised senders or centers

91
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,660
that they've set up who are sending

92
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,120
tweets that contain links or domains to

93
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,229
various domains that they've set up and

94
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:18,840
registered and if they're using a round

95
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,139
robin they send a message to each with a

96
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:25,919
link to each one and the full set of

97
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,700
users will do very similar behavior so

98
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,490
we'll note that this graphical algorithm

99
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,729
of identifying what the structure is

100
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:39,139
which is called a bipartite click

101
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,229
identifies this round robin behavior

102
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:48,710
also often you cannot get the full set

103
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,360
in our case we actually did achieve the

104
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,729
full set but in practice it's very

105
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,440
difficult in that case you had to find

106
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,940
an approximate bipartite click still any

107
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,340
structure which matches this is clearly

108
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,700
spam and it clearly breaks Twitter's

109
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,050
terms of service so it's at this point

110
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,800
we're very very confident that this is a

111
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,470
large outbreak of spam and needs to be

112
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,590
identified and blocked will also note

113
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,320
here there's nothing in this algorithm

114
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,920
that stops

115
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,890
as detecting shortened url's shortened

116
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,200
URLs are considered a complete bugbear

117
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,390
in the web reputation industry and in

118
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,880
social networks for the security

119
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,500
industry and done it again this side

120
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,080
here can be shortened url's there's

121
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,440
nothing restricting that so very useful

122
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,990
tool for working with these and other

123
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,070
graphical tools are also very useful so

124
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,540
based upon that half a billion tweets

125
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,050
were able to identify our this five

126
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,080
point eight percent and we are to

127
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:10,460
identify 17 large groups of spam this

128
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,730
constituted 75% of the spam that we were

129
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,370
able to identify I'm sure we knew some

130
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,990
out of a half a billion but we

131
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,080
identified a lot and will also note that

132
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,700
Twitter very much agreed with us they

133
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,130
subsequently suspended 34,000 of the

134
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,270
sender sending this spam the definition

135
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,570
of what constituted significant size was

136
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,640
one percent of the malicious tweets were

137
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,000
able to identify a lot of at the

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,610
particular stage there was huge

139
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,530
outbreaks of Russian and Eastern

140
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,100
European spam so much of this you'll see

141
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:56,900
in a second with Russian spam so here's

142
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,010
the top 10 groups you'll see I mentioned

143
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,700
here Russian 138 spam that's a syntactic

144
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,370
property the spam that I'll mention

145
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,810
they've actually abandoned that now but

146
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,060
it was very prevalent at the time and

147
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,190
very useful indicator for a long period

148
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,730
for us we identified the percentage of

149
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,380
malicious tweets that this group

150
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,350
constituted here so one of the groups

151
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:27,470
was enormous surprisingly and the

152
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,180
Twitter suspension rate was only ten

153
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,659
percent

154
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:33,700
other groups such as this one here had

155
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,019
approximately a ninety-eight percent

156
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:37,839
suspension rate the Twitter was totally

157
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,458
on top of them you notice that in many

158
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,979
of these cases twitter has done a really

159
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:46,560
good job though in others not so good

160
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,350
this are the slides a bit squashed this

161
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,930
is the confirmed senders and this is the

162
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:58,120
domains oh let's cut off them the

163
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,180
confirmed senders are the ones that are

164
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,970
in a full bipartite click that means

165
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,019
that there probably was more senders and

166
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,600
more spam we had a very strict criteria

167
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,529
there but those senders and those

168
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:17,470
domains are definitively in the spam

169
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,779
list beyond a shadow of a doubt in my

170
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:24,220
opinion alright the Russian 138 spam

171
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,800
that I mentioned it had a particular

172
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,850
syntactic structure it typically had

173
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,560
URLs of the structure within the tweets

174
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,010
where which had an Eastern European

175
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,899
extension then they'd have a series of

176
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:44,170
words separated by dash followed by a

177
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,750
timestamp this was the number of seconds

178
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,000
since I denry first nineteen seventy end

179
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,760
typically these time stamps were

180
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,230
occurring shortly before the spam Ram

181
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,670
they've largely abandoned that practice

182
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:09,910
so um here I described the coordinated

183
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,279
behavior that was occurring with the

184
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:17,260
spam runs so group a was an enormous

185
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:23,730
spam room 797 senders sending up to

186
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,570
120,000 tweets per hour and it stopped

187
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,410
on the 4th of October within the same

188
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,899
hour a different group of senders

189
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:37,350
sending to a different set of domains

190
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,800
started and

191
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:45,100
stopped tweeting two days six hours

192
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,259
later and group ii started spamming at

193
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:52,899
that moment you can see very clear

194
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:54,759
combination so when to put it all

195
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:59,799
together you can see clear coordination

196
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,769
with their spam strategy and actually

197
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:05,589
this is very reminiscent from email spam

198
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:09,239
that's that's my background here so

199
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:12,429
again further confirmation that this is

200
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:14,290
clearly breaking Twitter's terms of

201
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:19,720
service and is malicious and spam the

202
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,309
click-through rates on the social

203
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:24,339
networks are extraordinarily high we

204
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:26,709
were able to obtain this information

205
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:28,809
because we're able to use the SPN

206
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:31,540
network part of trend micro it's an

207
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,699
opt-in service where users give feedback

208
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:38,139
and they feedback things we've

209
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:40,480
identified as malicious so we were able

210
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,610
to take this opt-in data mainly from

211
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,179
consumers but some businesses opt-in

212
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:51,639
we're able to take this and identify per

213
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:54,579
tweet how many of our user base is

214
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:56,699
clicked on it so you notice this is

215
00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:02,379
restricted to our opt-in user base even

216
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:04,899
so with that restriction so these

217
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:08,309
numbers are clearly underestimate the

218
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:11,350
click-through rate per tweet is far

219
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,410
higher than what the click-through rate

220
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:20,799
per email spam a magnitude higher after

221
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:25,509
you factor in the fact that a.m. this is

222
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:28,179
a restricted this is much lower than

223
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:31,419
you'd expect across the full Twitter

224
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:35,199
user base you'll see that the

225
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,819
effectiveness of getting a tweet is

226
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:41,919
potentially tens of thousands times more

227
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,249
effective than sending out an email spam

228
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:48,309
the for their computational effort the

229
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,319
Twitter spammers are really achieving a

230
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:53,220
far better effect

231
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,430
um the next issue at various points on

232
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,020
this research are being challenged well

233
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,540
you know ration spam well rations might

234
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,630
care but it's not of universal concern

235
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,540
actually these are part of the problem

236
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,730
is that this is copyright infringing

237
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,730
material which people are willing to

238
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,580
actively go and search out so fifty

239
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,160
percent of the users that go and find it

240
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,040
because very convenient a rations but

241
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,170
fifty percent are coming from the rest

242
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,600
of the world and I don't believe that

243
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,060
all of this activity is occurring by

244
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,830
rational speakers all around the world

245
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,530
it's people going and looking for free

246
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,770
movies cracked gains so they don't have

247
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,820
to pay for it all sorts of other dodgy

248
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,510
activity and obviously this is a concern

249
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,910
for protecting consumers protecting

250
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,530
companies if people are going and

251
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,430
looking for this stuff so this is some

252
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,900
research that was performed by our pull

253
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,980
waters and he looked at what is the

254
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,920
danger of going to copyright infringing

255
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,700
websites he was mainly focusing on

256
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,050
movies copy games things like this and

257
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,430
what he discovered was that there's a

258
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,600
lot of these that use a business model

259
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,600
that involves infecting their users so

260
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,070
sure you get a free movie but you've

261
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,320
been infected by malware advertising in

262
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,630
fact forty-six percent of the

263
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,320
advertising on this on these copyright

264
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,860
infringing websites was malware so these

265
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,700
sorts of activities of surfing this spam

266
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,840
on Twitter it's certainly not safe now

267
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,940
like to quickly discuss the Twitter

268
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:49,660
fishing here the scheme involves a very

269
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,860
simple messages to your friends and

270
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,250
quite compelling as simple as now I'm

271
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,530
laughing so hard right now at this and

272
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,000
you just get a message from the send

273
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,010
their laughing had it something they

274
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,570
click on it they've timed out

275
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,970
according to the fishing page that

276
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:13,190
they've just clicked on and and they

277
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,930
think all I just type in my username and

278
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:21,280
password their accounts lost we you know

279
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,740
they always use shortened URLs there is

280
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,930
huge outbreak to this occurring earlier

281
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:31,220
this year and I'll quickly describe why

282
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,960
they were of significant size if they

283
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,750
get a single victim who sends to their

284
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,980
friends then if there's a sufficient

285
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,600
click-through rate and typing in the

286
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,230
password the cyber criminals were taking

287
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,870
those accounts and using some of them to

288
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,570
send further messages and continue a

289
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:59,660
viral scheme and monetizing others we

290
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,210
did a three month study where this

291
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,730
particular phishing scheme was at its

292
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,430
height from the first of march to the

293
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,700
first of june this year we were a

294
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,040
because we able to reverse-engineer the

295
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,740
scheme using the approach i described we

296
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,100
were able to identify very accurately

297
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,150
which accounts have been lost at various

298
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,610
points were able to identify up to

299
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,820
30,000 accounts per day were lost so

300
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,800
that's a significant number of Twitter

301
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,980
accounts that have been available on the

302
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,740
black market you know per day will note

303
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,660
Twitter took this very seriously and

304
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,850
really got on top of it it is

305
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,600
significantly subsided since in the

306
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,640
ongoing months I've got to congratulate

307
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:55,460
Twitter on that the security community

308
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,120
as a whole had very significant problems

309
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,600
with this task let's consider there some

310
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,770
primary techniques sandboxes honey pots

311
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,670
and shorten urls were providing a

312
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,470
further obstacle to the security

313
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,449
community well the result was

314
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:19,529
that let me define what's happening here

315
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:22,480
these are the ultimate landing page of

316
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,638
the phishing scheme that was getting

317
00:17:24,638 --> 00:17:28,089
potentially thousands of users so on

318
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,799
some days Trend Micro was actually

319
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:35,049
blocking and getting feedback from more

320
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:37,059
than a thousand trend users so that

321
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,850
means many many other users were

322
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:45,850
visiting these phishing sites and let's

323
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,179
go through it the shortened URL would

324
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:50,799
often go through a series of shortened

325
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,080
URLs redirection chain arrive at the

326
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,049
landing page so ultimately this is the

327
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:58,809
page that needs to be blocked in web

328
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:03,940
reputation systems the detection rate

329
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,519
across web reputation systems was very

330
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:11,500
low and that's because of this was the

331
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,630
resistance of the scheme to honeypot

332
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,639
because going from legitimate user to

333
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:18,130
legitimate user Sam boxing has no impact

334
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,220
here shortened URLs was getting

335
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,110
seriously in the way of web reputation

336
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,750
um now I'll hand it over to Paul to

337
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:34,919

trend micro philippines and i'd like to

340
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,320
discuss on the fodder scam so the

341
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,049
question is this to your followers come

342
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:49,750
actually work well the answer is yes so

343
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,380
I will show you the infection chain so

344
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:58,389
here it is so so an anon compromised

345
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:00,909
user may encounter a malicious tweet on

346
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:04,299
his feet and then the malicious tweet

347
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:07,269
can contain mention from the adder

348
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:09,940
Twitter accounts and then the hashtag

349
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,100
which rides on the trending keywords and

350
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,090
then of course the malicious link once

351
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,950
the link is click it will be redirected

352
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,460
to the followers com site the fire risk

353
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,440
on site has different types later I will

354
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,649
show it to you so on the following scam

355
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:28,010
site there are two options

356
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,770
the free one and the premium on the

357
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,130
premium the cybercriminals provide their

358
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,010
PayPal accounts well unfree you can

359
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,400
check it and after clicking it you will

360
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,270
be redirected to the authorization page

361
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:48,020
is what so in here authorization of app

362
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,120
for twitter account use so cyber

363
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,490
criminals abuse the twitter app or the

364
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:56,180
twitter development or API so if the

365
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:00,170
user has granted access to it the count

366
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,170
will be added to the file wristcom side

367
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,690
please which in turn becomes a circle

368
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,240
and compromise twitter account and after

369
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,650
that he will gain followers from unknown

370
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,470
people and also it will auto follow

371
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:19,310
compromised users in the process here

372
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,010
we'll go through in this cycle so after

373
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,400
that the twitter is now compromised

374
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,280
which in turn can have a malicious tweet

375
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,680
or malicious direct messages from a

376
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,460
droid compromised Twitter users so what

377
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,290
can I user do to avoid this spam or

378
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,440
remove this simply review up the Twitter

379
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,160
account so first need to go to the

380
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,920
Twitter app setting and revoke access to

381
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,890
malicious apps or you can unfollow

382
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,680
unknown users or mid account or delete

383
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,900
malicious direct messages or report the

384
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,280
abuse to Twitter so next is the types of

385
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,100
fodder scam the first one is the in

386
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,370
English which is working so as you can

387
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,110
see this is the common web page template

388
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,560
oh sorry so there's the free and then

389
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,990
there is the premier and the free it

390
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,540
says that you can gain 60 new followers

391
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,990
per ride ride mins per click on this

392
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,410
button select no in the premium one it

393
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,950
costs five euros and it says that you

394
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,050
can gain new followers every minute and

395
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,770
it is through their PayPal account and

396
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,720
then the next type is the follower scam

397
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,510
which is in indonesian language so you

398
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,340
can see that the common web page

399
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,700
template with it should look like this

400
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,990
so there's two buttons like get

401
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,420
followers premium and get retweet get

402
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,790
retweet means that the tweets can be

403
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,980
retweeted by the other theater accounts

404
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,200
automatically so the mode of payment

405
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,110
here is through the banks like banks of

406
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,940
Central Asia which is located in

407
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,790
Indonesia so the next type is the

408
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,220
following scam promos which is written

409
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,970
in Turkish so you can see here that

410
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,730
there are users compromised users in the

411
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:11,000
list and then normally the Turkish

412
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,080
followers cam has various web page

413
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,450
design and then the fourth one is the

414
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,340
followers come selling which is in

415
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,190
English so the common web page template

416
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,640
here will look like this so it is not

417
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,880
only limited in Twitter but also in

418
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,470
Facebook Pinterest YouTube and other

419
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:34,580
social networking sites so in here there

420
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,950
is no free but you can access that you

421
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:41,600
can order or purchase so the next one is

422
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,630
the scale on Twitter so see you can see

423
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,790
here the two types which are currently

424
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,040
active on Twitter the first one is in

425
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,470
Indonesia so you can see the top five

426
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,440
domains and the common top-level domains

427
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,770
use where that GA having forty-six

428
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:01,580
percent and the free service of DK forty

429
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,370
percent so in a one month study average

430
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:08,720
their estimated of 1000 125 tweets per

431
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,530
day and there are 165 confirmed centers

432
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,470
per day well on the other hand there are

433
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:20,000
top five domains for the selling type so

434
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,809
as you may notice there are very huge

435
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:26,090
number of tweet counts the reason is

436
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:31,160
that this scam type not only offers for

437
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,900
Twitter follower but also in other like

438
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,870
YouTube Facebook and others so that the

439
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,600
Twitter responsible for this spam is

440
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,270
already suspended and in the one month

441
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,730
study an average of twenty two thousand

442
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,940
tweets per day and then a confirm of

443
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,320
four thousand eight five centers per day

444
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,840
going next to the customer impact so

445
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,100
this one is

446
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,289
what's included in my blog blast and

447
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:01,130
worry so as you can see this is in the

448
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:04,250
English type type of followers can so

449
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,110
these are the IP addresses that hosts

450
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,010
the domains and this grab came from the

451
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,929
trend micro SP and feedbacks from

452
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:16,580
customers so in the first it has a high

453
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,190
pick and then afterwards after blocking

454
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,660
those remains it gradually decreases and

455
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,480
then to summarize the twitter followers

456
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,809
scam sites use same webpage comp a

457
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:32,360
template the cybercriminals create

458
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,940
several domains or or they have the same

459
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,919
web page template are they just use an

460
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,740
iframe on it that will lead to the

461
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,289
actual scam site and then the payment of

462
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:47,090
subscription is the main purpose and

463
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,400
then the twitter account authorization

464
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,470
and users lack of awareness is the main

465
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,169
cause of spam and lastly the indonesian

466
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:56,090
type and selling type are currently

467
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,049
active in twitter followers can to give

468
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:02,539
you the conclusion part of this research

469
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:06,460
i will hand it over to John Oliver

470
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:14,059
thanks Paul so in conclusion I'd first

471
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:16,820
feel like to discuss the Twitter ongoing

472
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,370
response they've got a bot maker

473
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,159
initiative they've been doing this for

474
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,240
quite a few years the recently released

475
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,909
a very interesting blog on the twentieth

476
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:32,990
of August this was a 30 day window prior

477
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,870
to that where did at this point

478
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:40,039
introduced a spam detection into the

479
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,260
right path so that they were able to

480
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,929
detect spam as it has been posted which

481
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:49,640
resulted in approximately forty percent

482
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,650
reduction in spam very quickly overall

483
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:59,510
their response has been very aggressive

484
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:03,950
on top of spam over the last year so if

485
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,850
we compare today to a year ago

486
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,280
really significant reduction from that

487
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,230
five point eight percent some

488
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,500
conclusions this has been an in depth of

489
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,440
study of volume as tax on Twitter we

490
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,650
fully expect the similar volume is

491
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,250
attacks are going on on all the other

492
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,130
social networks and we definitely

493
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:34,780
directly measured and seen that why is

494
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,640
this occurring because social networks

495
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,590
are so attractive very high

496
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,600
click-through rate high value on the

497
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,400
underground economy in addition great

498
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,520
way to get in to organizations you send

499
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,880
per person a social network link with

500
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,370
some message they're highly likely to

501
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:57,370
click on it the security community is

502
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,050
struggling because them our primary

503
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,020
methods are ineffective within the

504
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,810
social network environment it's critical

505
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:09,060
for security researchers to add big data

506
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,760
specifically graphical methods and

507
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,240
machine learning to their arsenal and

508
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,260
once again I'd like to express my

509
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,780
admiration at what Twitter's done

510
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,800
getting on top of these for the Twitter

511
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,330
social network so our thanks for being

512
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:36,030
here and we'll open up to Q&A I think
