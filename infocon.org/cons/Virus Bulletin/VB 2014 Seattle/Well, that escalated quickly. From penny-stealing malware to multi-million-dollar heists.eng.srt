1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,009
okay well good evening everyone I know

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:07,470
everyone is a little tired we have a big

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,690
lunch today we have a lot of technical

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,660
presentations right now I'm going to

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,480
discuss about Bitcoin it's a topic I'm

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,510
very passionate about and not only about

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,240
Bitcoin but Bitcoin in Latin America and

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,109
how it relates to malware so it's a

9
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,750
correlation of everything I don't only

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,689
try to analyze samples or show you

11
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,700
technical details or show you why

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,870
bitcoin is good or not bow but how

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,780
everything fits in the picture together

14
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,180
so when I chose the title for my

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,550
presentation I thought about anchorman

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,700
will first movie about how everything is

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,980
about being so fast and escalating so

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,710
quickly so if you haven't seen this

19
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,000
movie see it it's very funny ok let's

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,829
start with the presentation well in the

21
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,129
beginning we had Bitcoin here in the in

22
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,100
this part of the graph we see the

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,439
different coins that we have at the

24
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,140
moment and as you can see bitcoin is the

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,450
top cryptocurrency right now we have

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,119
light going we have dark coin we have

27
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,420
dogecoin we have a letter a lot of

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,720
cryptocurrencies but Bitcoin being the

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,750
first in the market and I discuss these

30
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,820
about in the paper about some economic

31
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,520
principles behind this the first mover

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,979
advantage or the network effect it's

33
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,640
very popular nowadays and as I was being

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,799
briefed just before the presentation

35
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,810
Bible is now accepting bitcoins the

36
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,259
value is changing a lot these days as I

37
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,750
will talk later but there are some

38
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,850
pretty cool things about Bitcoin and not

39
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,600
only this Intel ization privacy or the

40
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,950
speed at we can do transactions this

41
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,890
also this we can buy the weirdest thing

42
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,270
with Bitcoin I mean I was just looking

43
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,220
at the site where you can buy alpaca

44
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,110
socks with Bitcoin you can buy sweaters

45
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,550
you can

46
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,370
a lot of things that nobody really cares

47
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,870
about but you can do it only with

48
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,570
Bitcoin so what with that but the

49
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,400
community is really strong and they feel

50
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,760
like it's something that creates bonding

51
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,340
so they do these kind of things or slag

52
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,500
to sell so we also can mind the currency

53
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,990
so we can exchange Shore processing

54
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,290
power for money and I consider this an

55
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,630
alchemist stream I mean translating

56
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,940
processing power for money you're

57
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,040
translating reality your electric bill

58
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,220
for money in the past this was effective

59
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,890
this was profitable right now mining the

60
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,680
currency is not very profitable at least

61
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,310
at an amateur level you can do it if you

62
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,630
have an aiesec equipment on a fpga or or

63
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,520
a mining firm then it can become

64
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,140
profitable but nowadays it's not so much

65
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,180
then this is what I want to highlight in

66
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,330
this presentation the Bitcoin it's an

67
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,510
alternative especially in Latin America

68
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,580
where we have strict financial controls

69
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,820
where we have the local currencies that

70
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:27,250
are being in effect or are affected by

71
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,860
division or evolutionary processes the

72
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,140
inflation that we have so bitcoin is

73
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,810
seen by citizens as an alternative they

74
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,610
are looking for a way to escape the peso

75
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,209
to escape whatever currency they have in

76
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:44,120
order to have the learnings saved

77
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,040
somewhere else they want to escape the

78
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,080
government and bitcoin is offering this

79
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,150
whether we like it or not what else well

80
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,000
when it comes to security I call this

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,900
byob being your own Bank which is not so

82
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,280
easy uses are adopting Bitcoin but at

83
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,780
the same time they are becoming the

84
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,060
wrong banks they have to secure the

85
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,150
bitcoins they need to be aware of the

86
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,519
risks they need to have a valid then it

87
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,190
encrypted and if they are using an

88
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,190
exchange house we know many of the

89
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,918
incidents that happen not only mon gods

90
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,010
but others so it's not so easy being

91
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,330
your own bank

92
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,879
I will talk about this in a future

93
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,439
flight but okay what's not so cool about

94
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,199
bacon well this is a dogecoin sweater

95
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,259
but I wouldn't consider it cool you can

96
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,639
buy this kind of things with the

97
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,840
cryptocurrency what else it's a

98
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,639
nightmare for text agencies and

99
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,889
governments why is that because they

100
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,990
can't control it and they are very

101
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,319
afraid of this because tax agencies

102
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,009
depend on the honesty of the users with

103
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:00,289
descriptive currencies and as we know

104
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:04,120
this is not something feasible

105
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,590
governments aren't so keen about it

106
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,810
either in Argentina we are having an

107
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,360
Team honoree money laundering units

108
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,360
being interested in Bitcoin because they

109
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,190
want to learn how the citizens are

110
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,259
buying this cryptocurrency in order to

111
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:20,690
escape the tax agencies and the

112
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,060
government because it is happening this

113
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,979
is not a prediction it's happening right

114
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:30,409
now illegal markets they have come and

115
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:33,080
gone we know about Silk Road ship market

116
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,650
and Bitcoin in conjunction with the tour

117
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,800
PGP and a lot of nice tools that we use

118
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,370
every day it's being adopted by

119
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,699
cybercriminals and illegal markets in

120
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:50,740
order to sell this kind of goods online

121
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,569
then we have fraudsters and scammers

122
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:56,029
that are changing their fishing

123
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:58,370
campaigns in order 12 just a word

124
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,800
Bitcoin inside it we have seen the

125
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,750
Nigerian scam just adding the word

126
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,089
Bitcoin and you can see what this is

127
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:08,710
still working I mean it's unbelievable

128
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,150
the body of a liability this is

129
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,860
something not cool at the beginning of

130
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,779
the year we were around eight hundred

131
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:17,930
dollars per bitcoin this week I'm today

132
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,669
we are at 422 the values extreme or

133
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:25,219
highly volatile but nevertheless in

134
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,949
Latin America volatility is not an issue

135
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:30,169
for example when i did this presentation

136
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:33,259
the Pacer wasn't us around eight days

137
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,719
for one dollar today I got a message

138
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:38,270
from a friend that told me that I was

139
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,950
going to be like in the terminal

140
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,750
with Tom Hanks when you come back that

141
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,630
isn't going to be an Argentine today the

142
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,170
peso was there were 16 pesos for one

143
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,290
dollar so bowl ability is something were

144
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:56,600
used to in Latin America and then as in

145
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,250
the previous slide storing your own

146
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,880
money is not easy users especially in

147
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,100
emerging markets are learning about

148
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,890
Bitcoin but also about security and this

149
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,710
goes hand in hand but they can deal with

150
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,170
everything at once and cyber criminals

151
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,720
know this and know that they are buying

152
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,340
bitcoins but they don't know how to

153
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,360
secure them ok we have the market

154
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,990
capitalization until we reach the 21

155
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,300
million units that are dean for bitcoin

156
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,540
in the year 2140 is still a while we

157
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,310
don't know what the volume will be at

158
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,460
that time but we know that the market

159
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,590
capitalization keeps on growing and

160
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,750
cyber criminals are following these

161
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,330
trends and not only with Bitcoin they

162
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,030
are following with our cryptocurrencies

163
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,060
for example dogecoin litecoin or dark

164
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,570
coin and why is this I will talk about

165
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,610
it in the next slide but the reality is

166
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,280
that not only Bitcoin means money for

167
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,380
the cybercriminals all the currencies

168
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,570
can be translated to dollars or to other

169
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,360
cryptocurrencies so they are very eager

170
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,210
to follow this kind of market

171
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,610
capitalization graphics and daily values

172
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,260
worthless money there is crime and they

173
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,630
know this and we have seen this we have

174
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,700
evidence about this about the samples

175
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,500
that we are seeing in our lives every

176
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,020
day that they are changing Bitcoin for

177
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,990
dogecoin one day they are mining in a

178
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,560
mobile device the earth day they are

179
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,990
mining in DVR and the other day they are

180
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,940
creating a wallet stealer so they are

181
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,729
changing their approach based on the

182
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:37,580
value this is not random and this is

183
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,549
what I mean that when I talk about that

184
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:43,610
everything is related the economy the

185
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,040
psychological part and the malware

186
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,380
everything is related so difficulty

187
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,820
every and number of bloods

188
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,140
bitcoin the difficulty increases so when

189
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,770
mining becomes unprofitable and cyber

190
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,930
criminals resort to other currencies I

191
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,420
mean we have seen as I spoke previously

192
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,010
about mining malware but while it's

193
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,140
stealing right now is becoming the trend

194
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,510
of the norm when it comes to cyber crime

195
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,540
related to VidCon so why is this because

196
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,490
the difficulty with bitcoin is so hard

197
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,690
right now that even with a high gaming

198
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,720
computer you will still wouldn't make a

199
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,060
dime you will have to pay more for your

200
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,650
electrical bill ok rickrolling the block

201
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,550
chain i added this life because i

202
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,060
thought it was interesting how on how

203
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,090
bitcoin changes our lives so please read

204
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,500
this tweet with me yeah rickrolling and

205
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,720
you can find inside the blockchain the

206
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,110
entire lyrics for the Rick Astley song

207
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,840
now we're going to give you up yeah the

208
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,570
entire song in the blog shine but not

209
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,000
only that you can find the stone papyrus

210
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,380
in the blockchain this was detected this

211
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,840
year and a lot of miners complain that

212
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,390
they couldn't use Bitcoin because this

213
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,330
was being detected so no blockchain no

214
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,320
mining we have Nelson Mandela pictures

215
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,940
and quotes we also have WikiLeaks cables

216
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,660
and spy files everything in there there

217
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,060
are even services like cryptography tea

218
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,170
or cryptos crypto secret which are used

219
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,270
between couples to sing like lovers

220
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,550
messages and things like that this is

221
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,920
now becoming automated adding garbage

222
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,980
inside the block chain but one question

223
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,100
I want to ask with you we have already

224
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,130
received reports about people including

225
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,950
child pornography inside the blockchain

226
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,060
what about when you don't load

227
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,030
everything into your computer what do we

228
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,820
stand on these legally

229
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,180
and this is something we need to keep

230
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,660
researching because I find extremely

231
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,220
interesting that everyone is downloading

232
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,290
the blockchain without knowing all the

233
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,530
garbage that they are getting too okay

234
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,090
yeah I know the only guy that could

235
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,000
would roll font from My gods his name

236
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,460
Chuck Norris the rest of them couldn't

237
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,730
withdraw a single cent yeah so we have

238
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,320
many attacks and vulnerabilities that

239
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,470
can be done with Bitcoin Mont God's

240
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,570
blame transaction malleability bug

241
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,850
because of bad implementation on their

242
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,450
software but we also have as I mentioned

243
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,310
previously illegal content in the

244
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,160
blockchain we have the 51-percent attack

245
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,390
when for example mining pools have

246
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,630
enough clients that they can overrun the

247
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,510
network they can choose if to accept or

248
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,360
not a transaction so this is a possible

249
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,430
attack add up though it needs a lot of

250
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,190
processing power then we have denial of

251
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,800
service so for probabilities and of

252
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,920
course malware yeah mont gods this is an

253
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,970
interesting case the first incident that

254
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,810
they reported was her work hong kong IP

255
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,110
accessing one of their sites account and

256
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,420
sterling the selling of a lot of

257
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,050
bitcoins causing a price drop that was

258
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,390
really devastating for the currency

259
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,910
because everyone lost the confidence in

260
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,760
Bitcoin at that time then we saw in

261
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,670
February this year that they blamed as I

262
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,290
mentioned previously transaction

263
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,170
malleability for their demise in reality

264
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,360
and if you read other papers and

265
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,240
research about the topics this is highly

266
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,570
unlikely the realities that we don't

267
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,420
know what happened with mongols but at

268
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,700
the time they were handling around seven

269
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,380
percent of all the bitcoins in existence

270
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:03,110
and their closure left a half a billion

271
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:08,070
use USD american dollars stolen so

272
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,400
that's a lot of money and there was only

273
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,050
one of the exchange

274
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,070
is that suffer this type of incidents we

275
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,510
have other exchange houses most of them

276
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,550
suffering these type of attacks I mean

277
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,080
attacks worthy we don't know what

278
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,600
happened or just suffering playing

279
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,670
social engineering attacks for example

280
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,180
there was canadian bitcoins where a guy

281
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,550
just called the data center and told

282
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,250
them hey I need I need you to restart

283
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,769
the server in safe mode and they did and

284
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:42,180
they stole the bitcoins because they

285
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,220
were able to bypass all security

286
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,579
measures so this is the kind of security

287
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:51,480
that exchanges had I mean and we go we

288
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,240
used to consider them as banks banks

289
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,250
have insurance Bank have security

290
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,190
policies exchange houses didn't right

291
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,920
now we are seeing a paradigm shift

292
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,440
hopefully for the better but there are

293
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,240
also other things in the Bitcoin

294
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,480
scenario for example we have Ponzi

295
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,720
schemes like a bit conceiving suntrust

296
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,529
which was being managed by a guy called

297
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:19,800
pirate at 40 before being called that

298
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,649
way he was called the pirate savings and

299
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:26,370
trust and it promised sever point seven

300
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,850
percent return weekly on your investment

301
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,149
of course this was a Ponzi scheme and if

302
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:35,310
you were the last to join I'm sorry you

303
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:40,589
lost your money then the malware I want

304
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:43,130
to talk about this because of the

305
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,839
relation between the pricing Bitcoin and

306
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,980
the type of malware that we see so if we

307
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,620
were to put the same graphic of the

308
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,410
Bitcoin value on top of these you would

309
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,260
see it correlates when the value of

310
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,770
Bitcoin decreases you would see that the

311
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,750
malware samples start focusing elsewhere

312
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,480
you would see them focusing on dogecoin

313
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,250
or casino coin on other currencies that

314
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,779
are becoming more adopted by the

315
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,540
audience in the same way that difficulty

316
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,430
increases they are also resorting to

317
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:22,339
cryptocurrencies this was a pretty

318
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:26,550
simple marwar that we'd seen as

319
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,600
mont goats closed this was just a leak

320
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,470
that was filter andhra online and it was

321
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,790
a client that was supposedly to access

322
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,279
the mongols details that were being

323
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,890
leaked and in reality it was a wallet

324
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,079
stealer and credential stealer and away

325
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,260
why do i say this is very simple because

326
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,230
it was sending the credentials just by

327
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,399
using base fifth 64 encoding and

328
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,410
nevertheless this still work and this is

329
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,680
something that amazes me nowadays we are

330
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,930
seeing these type of things still

331
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:11,490
working and wow again we've seen when

332
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,790
there is a data breach we see that

333
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,910
someone in based in both these posts

334
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,570
about okay give me your bitcoins i will

335
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,810
sell you the database dump in many cases

336
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,860
this is a scam we've seen also facing

337
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,490
phishing messages even after Mongols

338
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,610
closed they will keep on fishing on the

339
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,279
sides so they were telling the users

340
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,610
okay i know the side died but I need

341
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,920
your credentials to close it definitely

342
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,160
why is that because many users you reuse

343
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,200
their credentials so cyber criminals

344
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,350
nudists and they still like kick that

345
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,660
dog they will still keep on beating the

346
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,490
same thing then other types of simple

347
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,180
scams like okay USA is going to burn a

348
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,209
shot Bitcoin okay click here click here

349
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:11,040
and get infected for free yeah what

350
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,640
about some interesting stuff okay we

351
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,280
have seen Internet of Things devices

352
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,380
which is a trending world I don't like

353
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,510
it but we have seen for example DPR

354
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,939
equipments or network attached storage

355
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,270
and devices getting infected with with

356
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,880
minors I mean if you know the capacity

357
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,160
of the order processing power that these

358
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,760
devices have this makes no sense at all

359
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,790
I mean when we calculated the hashing

360
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,840
power of this

361
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,830
you would get like two cents every other

362
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,419
three months of something like that it

363
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,820
would pay more for your electric bill of

364
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,039
course if you are the cybercriminal you

365
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,950
don't care about this but still is it

366
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,000
worth to do a mining malware for a DVR I

367
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,600
know then you will have chrome

368
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,590
extensions that would steal your wallet

369
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,950
then yeah mobile applications that would

370
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,860
offer you wallpaper interesting

371
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,880
wallpaper run away and they would check

372
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,580
for your battery level they would check

373
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,950
if the phone was plugged in or not and

374
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,770
would still start mining the currency

375
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,070
Bitcoin in this case then we have other

376
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,500
examples targeting dogecoin and casino

377
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,950
going this was much sad the much said

378
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,390
malware that also was used as a mobile

379
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:41,640
minor I don't know still affecting the

380
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,700
users but in reality the profits that

381
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,770
you would get with this type of miners

382
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:51,570
are pretty slim okay and what happens

383
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,850
when the cyber criminals get your heart

384
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,159
and bitcoins okay they are gone and they

385
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:59,029
are gone forever we've seen in reddit

386
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:01,740
some people moonlighting as private

387
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,320
investigators they are trying to follow

388
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,820
the money you know you have the

389
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,250
blockchain is public you can follow the

390
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,720
blog China you can see where the money

391
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,390
has been moving and you can say oh look

392
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,909
this guy has my money and they started

393
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:16,470
daxing people they started releasing

394
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,620
personal information but reddit told

395
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,929
them okay you need to stop this this is

396
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:23,580
a witch hunt you're releasing personal

397
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,649
information on people that have nothing

398
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:27,960
to do with this incident your money is

399
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,450
gone accept it and that's it okay as I

400
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,820
mentioned previously when I studied this

401
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,450
presentation or this research we have 10

402
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,090
pesos firm for one dollar the dollar

403
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,049
messy we call it in Argentina 10 for one

404
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:49,799
right now we are 16 for one so what I

405
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:53,370
want to highlight is how in Argentina

406
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,940
teyla and other places in latin america

407
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,430
we are seeing a desperate need for other

408
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,130
currencies and people are learning about

409
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,460
Bitcoin because they are forced to they

410
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,440
want to escape the local currency and

411
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,200
I've seen like little papers on the

412
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,300
train station where it says shine the

413
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,240
revolution buy bitcoins you say in

414
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,809
Argentina yeah so we have a very large

415
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:24,090
market for illegal dollars you know

416
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,580
Argentina has a history with this but

417
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,410
people are resorting to VidCon and other

418
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,300
cryptocurrencies we have foundation

419
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,440
there that holds weekly meetings the

420
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,380
anti-money laundering unit is taking

421
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,620
part of this so this is something that

422
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,410
is happening and this is what I want you

423
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,530
to take out of this that Latin America

424
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:50,010
is specific or has some characteristics

425
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,260
difference from the rest of the world

426
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,570
all Latin America is different and we

427
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,280
have this type of things happening right

428
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,240
now and if people are resorting to

429
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,400
VidCon cyber criminals are resorting to

430
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,200
beat going to they are following the

431
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,230
money so we know that argentineans and

432
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,350
Latin Americans are using bit going

433
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,390
another cryptocurrencies we need to

434
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:16,350
follow it closely some people learn

435
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,020
falsely as I mentioned previously mostly

436
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,140
because of around somewhere infection we

437
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,720
have seen cryptolocker then bit crypt

438
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,260
for example included a waltz dealer then

439
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,690
we have the rabbit on run some more

440
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:39,110
family that included mobile a minor so

441
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,420
cyber criminals are keen or are kind

442
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,150
with us because we don't have dollars so

443
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,950
some of the time they offer discount

444
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,050
rates because they know we can't buy the

445
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,890
dollars so this is interesting but still

446
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,840
I've seen a lot of friends that ask me

447
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,480
what is a Bitcoin and where do i buy one

448
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,210
I have my files encrypted and I don't

449
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,000
know what to do and this is our reality

450
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,010
and people who are learning because of

451
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,740
these

452
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:12,180
okay so what do I hope for the future or

453
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,090
where are we standing right now we are

454
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,470
seeing that my name botnets are

455
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,290
something that it's not so hot right now

456
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,290
we are shifting to wallet stealing

457
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,320
because people don't trust these change

458
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,200
houses and with a good reason I mean

459
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,890
some of them likes apple in Argentina

460
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,410
that is launching right now offers kind

461
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,050
of uninsurance like a bank but others

462
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,620
are still like a she's behind so people

463
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,680
are served saving their bitcoins in the

464
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,810
wrong home maybe in a USB behind the

465
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,660
mattress or a sofa so this means that

466
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,900
cybercriminals habit really easy and

467
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,260
it's a responsibility for all of us to

468
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,420
provide protection to this type of

469
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,760
malware scams fishing to provide

470
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,520
education and to let them know what the

471
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,630
threats are of using cryptocurrencies as

472
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,390
I mentioned in the first slide of course

473
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,030
you have many cool things about Bitcoin

474
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:18,390
but there are also risks and we are not

475
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,450
in Kansas anymore this is going

476
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,400
escalating pretty quickly so we need to

477
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,780
be aware and we need to educate thank
