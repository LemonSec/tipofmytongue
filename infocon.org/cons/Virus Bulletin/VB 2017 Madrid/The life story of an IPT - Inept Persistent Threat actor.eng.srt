journalist a blogger from Poland I used

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,590
to work for a large telecom company but

21
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,539
I quit my job a month ago to write

22
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,960
articles about security and I'm also a

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,489
storyteller and I wanted to tell you a

24
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,220
story about a guy about the guy who's

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,260
who I've been following for the last

26
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,250
five years and and I've almost fallen in

27
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,740
love with him and with his with his life

28
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,490
but first let's go back to November 26

29
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,970
2011 when Atlas 5 rocket is taking off

30
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,369
from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station

31
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,950
and it goes to Mars and it carries the

32
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,369
Curiosity rover with it on the very same

33
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,020
day somebody on the internet says

34
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,220
there's a shop selling fake phones

35
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,689
actually not selling just offering at

36
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,960
very discounted prices and somebody else

37
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,090
as well don't buy there the company does

38
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:45,930
not exist

39
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,740
the prices are way too low just don't go

40
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,049
it's a fake shop then somebody jumps in

41
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,909
into this discussion apparently the

42
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,950
owner of the shop says we are serious

43
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,020
company we were registered in the UK and

44
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,820
we have a license for international

45
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,130
sales so there's no risk you can go on

46
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,700
and buy your buy your phones with us

47
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,020
unfortunately a few days later somebody

48
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,060
says well I just lost about a thousand

49
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,580
euros at this shop but the administrator

50
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,500
named I was able to identify his

51
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,390
mr. Amash taka please remember the name

52
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,510
it will be important a little bit later

53
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,720
so fast-forward to May 24 2012 Mars

54
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,600
Science Laboratory goes to Mars and our

55
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,520
hero starts to looking for help with

56
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,800
setting up botnets this is a screenshot

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,500
from a closed dark net program in Polish

58
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,120
where the user Hunter 248 asks the

59
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,310
following administrator can you help me

60
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,200
with setting up about a botnet I pay how

61
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,360
much

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,770
unfortunately 10 hours later the same

63
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,310
user but with another Elias says sorry I

64
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,980
already lost access to my account under

65
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,340
the hunter nickname and it looks like it

66
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,500
took him 10 hours to forget his password

67
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,630
it will be a pattern that we will follow

68
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,340
today well fast forward August 1st 2012

69
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,709
curiosity is now 5 days away from Mars

70
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:07,800
and our hero opens an account on hack

71
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,660
forums I guess everybody in the room

72
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,480
knows it it's a it's a really good place

73
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,540
to start your hacking career he assumes

74
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,160
the nickname of AI Magadan who'll change

75
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,489
it later to the egg sacs use it he gets

76
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:22,350
a specific business model because he

77
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,799
wants everything with no cost at maximum

78
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:28,560
profit well he's looking for some free

79
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,250
krypter 3 VPNs free VPS free binders

80
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,230
everything's free he's interested in it

81
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,380
well after he makes some calculations he

82
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,480
decides well free is not always the best

83
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,840
one so he goes full monty and wants to

84
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,450
buy something he wants to buy a botnet

85
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,880
set up a full package of a botnet well

86
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,340
perhaps some of you remember IRC botnets

87
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,540
he decides to golf on afina IRC BOTS and

88
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,880
of course he doesn't forget to mention a

89
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,500
Skype name that he can be contacted

90
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,900
under which is Phillip to occur remember

91
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,489
the first was too much tree a cadiz are

92
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,079
brothers if you wonder why the first

93
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,950
name changes well he he finally decides

94
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,410
with that but we've got a krypter he's

95
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,600
very satisfied with the service because

96
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,950
you know on hack forms the satyrs are

97
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,529
really friendly they even help you by

98
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,390
TeamViewer if you cannot set up your own

99
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,720
botnet so if you've got a bot it's

100
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,910
already cryptid what's now well you need

101
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,000
to spread it so spreading time first he

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,750
in person

103
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,090
it's Kaspersky Lab and says there's an

104
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,680
issue if every single browser in the

105
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,130
world

106
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,930
just download the patch and you will be

107
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,060
safe of course their website is safe

108
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,310
world optical looks very safe to me

109
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,500
best regards Kaspersky Lab this is his

110
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,600
signature at the very very early days

111
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,570
then another day another campaign this

112
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,520
time he impersonates Allegro this is a

113
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,530
Polish eBay site very popular in Poland

114
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,680
and says well your passwords was taken

115
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,880
over just go to recover Allegro TK and

116
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,190
and download the program that we secured

117
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,050
your account which is of course a botnet

118
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,390
client download new password generator

119
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,910
and people do download the new password

120
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,960
generator if you wonder then a day later

121
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,470
September 26 curiosity is fighting heavy

122
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,720
winds on Mars collecting some probes and

123
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,970
our hero decides to talk to random

124
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,040
Internet users on our internet forum

125
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,410
where they were discussing his campaign

126
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,810
and he joins the discussion and says yes

127
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,669
Kaspersky integra was my job I just

128
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:28,560
downloaded two pictures from Google it

129
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,330
took me five minutes and it was really

130
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,100
effective people do believe in my

131
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,669
messages well if you don't believe in

132
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,950
his messages he also decides to publish

133
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,500
a screenshot of his botnet to prove his

134
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,479
success to everyone on the internet

135
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,510
because he likes Fame and he publishes

136
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,510
the screenshot with 5,000 hits on his

137
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,940
landing page of course not forgetting to

138
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,370
mention his skype name because why not

139
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,710
and then he publishes a screenshot from

140
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,229
an M I see clients perhaps some of you

141
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:01,380
remember we used to go on each channels

142
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,750
with that and there's there's obviously

143
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,360
like 70 to 90 BOTS there and they are

144
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,350
wheel and the Skype why not and he brags

145
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,169
about 900 infractions and says he'll

146
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:15,450
mind it going with the botnet so we go

147
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,580
quickly to the hack forums and look for

148
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,100
new posts by our hero and of course he's

149
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,950
interested in a Bitcoin miner mind the

150
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,590
price it's one dollar only so a really

151
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,860
good business model and and there's a

152
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,260
frustration also growing because he's

153
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,479
got a lot of technical issues he he

154
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,400
knows nothing about computers and he

155
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,289
cannot connect to his routes over his

156
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:39,090
polls are open well I don't know how he

157
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,430
solves it but finally he solves it

158
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,400
small fighters accumulate and this time

159
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,010
he cannot clipped his botnet because

160
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,780
there's trouble with the end of five

161
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,760
marker he does not understand how to set

162
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,280
it up and the vendor is angry at him and

163
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,290
as well I won't serve this customer it's

164
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,430
his so stupid

165
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,780
well remembers caparelli landing this is

166
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,610
this was a probe that tried to land on

167
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,680
Mars but hit really hard and well

168
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,600
nothing state of it except for the

169
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,540
impact crater on the picture our hero

170
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,660
has similar adventures because his VPS

171
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,540
provider is changing the server and the

172
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,520
dialogue goes like well where's my

173
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,620
server while we moving to a new one will

174
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,540
I get a new IP address of course you

175
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,729
will so I will lose all my botnet

176
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:26,930
clients okay you didn't use dynamic DNS

177
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,570
well he didn't use dynamic DNS he loses

178
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,820
his botnet because of the server move so

179
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,419
sometimes you learn the hard way so if

180
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,039
you lose your botnet what do you do you

181
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,650
spread a new one of course a new a new

182
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,169
campaign this time impersonating again

183
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:45,000
Allegro which is really popular in

184
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,979
Poland and just download some software

185
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,620
and best regards Allegro group and

186
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,840
people do download then he goes

187
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,400
international because there are some

188
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,740
brands that are more popular outside of

189
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,419
Poland and other go so he goes for

190
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,180
PayPal the website even has SSL in this

191
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,430
name so it's really secure and of course

192
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,229
best regards PayPal groove just download

193
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:06,570
my botnet and please install it and then

194
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,580
one day he decides to go for Facebook

195
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,349
which is a popular brand everywhere and

196
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:13,620
he changes his signature to Andrew John

197
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,539
stewardship monitoring section security

198
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,060
and server administration department if

199
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,530
it does look a little bit too

200
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,470
sophisticated for him yeah it does so

201
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,139
why why the new signature where does it

202
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:25,800
come from

203
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,110
well I investigated a bit and found out

204
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,120
that on the same forum he was discussing

205
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,400
before there was a guy saying why do

206
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,320
those all scammers don't do the job

207
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,510
properly why do they use phrases like

208
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,208
regards PayPal group it's so stupid they

209
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,010
should use something more complex like

210
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,570
Andrew Smith stewardship monitoring

211
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,799
section security and server the

212
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,870
administration department so he reads

213
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,150
the comments by the other Internet users

214
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,390
and uses them to improve his tradecraft

215
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,550
and this will be his signature from the

216
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,450
time

217
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,990
for the next few years well if you've

218
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,480
got the botnet and then you start making

219
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,480
money with it so February 2013 first

220
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,430
commercial offer he's selling steam

221
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,320
accounts I'm not a gamer I don't know if

222
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,600
he prices are good or not but well there

223
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,430
he had some customers buying those

224
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,610
accounts from him and he's looking for

225
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,320
multiple monetization vectors he

226
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,000
promises to install software on his

227
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,130
botnet and some on January 31st 2013 he

228
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,110
goes into his first romance with

229
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,970
electronic banking because he starts

230
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,950
attacking customers of the largest bank

231
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,800
in Poland the website looks very real

232
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,870
and of course it's stewardship

233
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,880
monitoring section that's that sense

234
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,640
it's kinda guards to customers the

235
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,800
phishing landing page is quite simple

236
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,380
it's just a copy of the bank website not

237
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,850
once you provide the login and password

238
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,850
you get asked for 10 codes from a

239
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,970
scratch card the squat card has 50 and

240
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,250
he asks only for 10 so there's a 20%

241
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,740
chance that he'll hit the right one and

242
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,230
if you wonder if people will scratch 10

243
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,060
codes and put them on the website yes

244
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,370
they will and a guy from this bank told

245
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,870
me that once they had an attack where

246
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,850
the customers were asked to put all 50

247
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,399
codes and some customers did so people

248
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,350
do things like that and he benefits from

249
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:15,540
it and in June 2014 he starts delivering

250
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,699
his own services like I'm a-gettin

251
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:20,220
sponsored it's because why not he

252
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,100
charges about $4 per 10,000 messages I

253
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,870
don't know if it's a good price or not I

254
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,990
never bought spam from a botnet but

255
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,579
anyway the business is apparently good

256
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:34,110
any astronomers in the room who can tell

257
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,279
me what's in the picture its Andromeda

258
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,680
galaxy and Andromeda bye-bye a chance is

259
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,440
also a botnet and he changes from his

260
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,990
Athena because because it was really

261
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,120
simple to something more complex and as

262
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,880
he made a lot of money he spends six

263
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,890
dollars on Andromeda it's a large

264
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:56,040
investment for him and he installs the

265
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,490
Andromeda and he's very satisfied with

266
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,440
with the support he gets on hard forums

267
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,570
for it and in dry

268
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,410
- how 2050 13 he's already has a

269
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,590
thousand BOTS on on this botnet and then

270
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,970
he starts publishing some screenshots

271
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,610
and is August 15 it's almost three

272
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,830
thousand votes already which is not that

273
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,310
bad

274
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,950
two days later is more than 3000 boards

275
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,910
and mean why the curiosity takes very

276
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,400
nice doom pictures on Mars and our hero

277
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,920
decides to start selling his botnet I

278
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,320
don't know why but he offers 3200 BOTS

279
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,720
$440 I think it's a bargain

280
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,610
if only I saw the ad at the time I would

281
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,370
buy it but unfortunately I missed the

282
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,860
opportunity I have no idea how this time

283
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,600
he infected his customers I looked

284
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,460
through all the campaigns and all the

285
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,950
possible infection vectors and couldn't

286
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,930
find anything but I found some parts of

287
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,610
him but saying that he uses we're

288
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,520
spreading and he stuck getting gamers so

289
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,370
probably some hacks for csgo or

290
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,010
something like that we're spread on on

291
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,250
some forums I'm not frequenting then

292
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,980
suddenly he gets scammed on a scammer

293
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,070
forum which is quite probable because he

294
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,560
wants to sell a you cash voucher some of

295
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,870
you probably remember this internet kind

296
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,000
of payments before Bitcoin became

297
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,220
popular and he sends the you cash

298
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,510
voucher to the buyer but the buyer

299
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,190
doesn't believe the money that doesn't

300
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,140
deliver the money and our hero decides

301
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,790
to publish the full screenshot of a

302
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,520
conversation with the buyer and forgets

303
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,500
to obfuscate the you cash voucher number

304
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,840
so if you want to investigate him then

305
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,320
then you have it then he decides to DDoS

306
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,750
because he's got a botnet he probably

307
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,960
didn't sell it and he has he has to make

308
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,200
some money and he threatens a small ISP

309
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,210
this is a message I was able to identify

310
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,660
and he wants to charge only 600 euro for

311
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,120
non ddosing him but then he decides to

312
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,150
do some other companies and here's he's

313
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,160
a very very good recommendation if you

314
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,800
host your botnet at a hosting company

315
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,900
please don't abuse it because suddenly

316
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,670
they become very interested in locating

317
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,830
your C&C and if they find it on their

318
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,680
own network they will take it down so he

319
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,700
loses his botnet again sorry and swell

320
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,530
he needs more money because he's got

321
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,130
nobody

322
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,829
so he decides to invest in a malware

323
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:24,279
that will mimic an existing malware and

324
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,319
in Poland there was a guy who invented a

325
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:28,839
new malware that actually was looking at

326
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:31,089
the clipboard of your computer for a

327
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:33,430
pattern of a bank account number and if

328
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,290
you made a copy paste of a bank account

329
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,790
it was looking for it in the clipboard

330
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,410
and switched it for its own account

331
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,540
number so you could paste the the

332
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,160
malicious account number into your

333
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,790
transfer and our hero looks for somebody

334
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,339
to write a similar code for him and to

335
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:50,800
show how it works he links to a site

336
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,620
Poland movie showing the competitor at

337
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,350
work but suddenly on a scammers volume

338
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,350
he gets scammed again which happens from

339
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,120
time to time somebody takes his six

340
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,699
dollars and doesn't deliver the code so

341
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:06,279
he decides to publish the conversation

342
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:09,459
again using very professional efficient

343
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:12,610
methods like the paint bucket and if you

344
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,350
go on the website where the screenshot

345
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,690
was published is some image hosting

346
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,970
website and it's like the puff goes like

347
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,860
screenshots something-something zero for

348
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,139
if you go for zero free you get free the

349
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:26,319
obfuscation but there's nothing

350
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:28,329
interesting in there just just a funny

351
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:31,149
screen and you can just check he's

352
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:33,550
listening to the Polish rap which is not

353
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,240
of very high quality and then he decides

354
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,279
it's time for exploit kids because they

355
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,870
are fancy and he wants to be a big

356
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,389
hacker and he buys an exploit kid and he

357
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:46,630
bites traffic geo-located for Poland so

358
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,209
I've got a screenshot of the results of

359
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:51,430
the landing page of his exploit kid

360
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,230
how many infections do you think he got

361
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,490
with it while taking into account the

362
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,589
story so far

363
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:02,319
well it's zero sorry it didn't work he

364
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:05,380
was just unlucky but he tries he always

365
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,170
tries he never gives up he gets he gets

366
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,959
another post for for writing the same

367
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,050
code to switch the clipboard account

368
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,509
number this time he goes big he wants to

369
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:17,980
pay he wants to pay eight dollars

370
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,730
instead of six to get up on the

371
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,269
on the market and he apparently gets the

372
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:27,730
job done finally because South Poland a

373
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,399
few weeks later I'd say come it's an

374
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,319
information that they've got a new actor

375
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:34,329
with malware changing the account number

376
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:37,059
in the clipboard and it's distributed by

377
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:38,379
Andromeda botnet

378
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:42,850
so it must be our hero then in May 2014

379
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,639
he gets really innovative because he's

380
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,199
one of the first actors on the Polish

381
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,839
market to use Word documents with macros

382
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,809
and he puts a post on my facebook

383
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:55,569
profile saying there was a big hack of

384
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:57,790
Bitcoin exchange in Poland which is big

385
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,850
news well you can call him a prophet

386
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,529
because the hack took place few years

387
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,869
later but if you want to check the

388
00:16:04,869 --> 00:16:06,579
details of the hack of course you have

389
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:08,679
to enable macros in a world document I

390
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,179
don't enable macros so I don't get

391
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:13,629
infected then he goes back to spamming

392
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:17,230
the other group the allegro brand and

393
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,259
this time he really goes here he goes

394
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:22,959
into detail because he puts real-life

395
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,389
auction title here for sellers from this

396
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:28,720
website and he of course keeps the

397
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,559
signature as you already know it and the

398
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,079
document says that your account was

399
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:38,169
blocked please unlock these reasonable

400
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:41,499
macros to to read the contents if you

401
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:44,889
check the metadata above the world file

402
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:47,949
you find his first name and in the PDB

403
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:50,230
path in the binary you also find his

404
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,989
first name because he's Thomas anyway

405
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:57,879
and in July 15 he decides to invest in

406
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:01,959
some Android Trojans and it takes him a

407
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:04,839
week to get to know how it works and

408
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,909
another campaign impersonating Kaspersky

409
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:09,309
this time Kaspersky is offering Android

410
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:13,179
app to sniff your SMS messages with two

411
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:15,939
FA codes and send to to the to the

412
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:18,609
malware alpha but apparently it doesn't

413
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:20,589
work very well it's the only Android

414
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,740
campaign I was able to identify then he

415
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,480
achieves perfection because his botnet

416
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,699
has been deleted and removed and lost so

417
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:29,440
many times that he is so proficient in

418
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,419
setting it up that he starts selling his

419
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:33,850
own botnet setup services

420
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,100
and the price is really good I think $10

421
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,010
for a new botnet with full service with

422
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,770
high quality setup and he even offers

423
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,650
24/7 support anti-ddos services and

424
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,200
whatever you ask he eats there it's 10

425
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,039
bucks only so really a bargain and

426
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,330
curiosity is still exploring Mars and

427
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,059
taking those beautiful pictures and in

428
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:57,970
and our hero decides to go for a true

429
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,370
apt attack and I really mean an apt

430
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,260
attack that involved Secret Service in

431
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,440
Poland because this is a building of of

432
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,900
a district court in Poland very close to

433
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,210
the place our hero is born and the court

434
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,419
is deciding on a case where a family

435
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:16,030
member of our hero is involved and he

436
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,549
identifies the people behind the case on

437
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:20,799
the court and he sends them messages

438
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,049
with malware he fax their computers and

439
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:26,080
he steals the case files it's the only

440
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,450
documented attack on a judicial system

441
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:32,100
in Poland that actually succeeded and

442
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,370
some some really serious security

443
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,679
security services are involved in

444
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:41,380
investigating the case but once they

445
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,390
discover who did they just transfer the

446
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,980
case to the regular police and don't

447
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,030
care about it anymore our hero gets back

448
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,130
to spamming this time he impersonates

449
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,409
some lawyers and the impersonation is

450
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:58,450
quite efficient because his his malware

451
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,870
has usually very very complex structure

452
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,720
this time is what it was a PDF dot gif

453
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,020
file that downloaded

454
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,820
another dropper that downloaded an auto

455
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,980
it dropper that downloaded finally and

456
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,110
Ramadan and one of the stages it makes

457
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,510
requests to a bitly link so you can

458
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,340
follow the statistics because we didn't

459
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,700
make that account private so you can see

460
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,440
the clicks I imagine some of your

461
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,510
companies are in their statistics as

462
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,690
well because while you analyze it but I

463
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,260
think a lot of lawyers actually do click

464
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,419
the the malware in run it this is the

465
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:35,980
screenshot from another campaign a week

466
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,289
later so he gets people infected he's

467
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:41,980
really effective and it works then in

468
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,169
October 2015 he gives an impromptu

469
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:47,290
interview one of my friends working

470
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,290
reverse engineer for a large polish bank

471
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:53,620
sits on a life binary of of this actor

472
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,810
and suddenly windows pops up and the

473
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,310
guys start talking to their Weber's

474
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,340
engineer and there's a huge compliment

475
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,770
in the text where he says since Adam

476
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,200
started writing about my campaigns the

477
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,750
infection rate fell from 10 percent to 2

478
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,020
so it means I do my job well describing

479
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,520
what he does and I'm really satisfied

480
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,420
with it and unfortunately he refused to

481
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,790
give me until views despite many

482
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,740
attempts to contact him he doesn't want

483
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,480
to talk to me this was the only one I

484
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,050
was able to get and in December 2015

485
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,500
he suddenly pops up his game and he

486
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,120
starts offering Microsoft Office

487
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,720
exploits and the the exploits of of

488
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,700
course animal were compatible because

489
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,970
there are really high-quality and except

490
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,040
for a macro exploit he's also offering a

491
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,350
silent exploit which means he's got

492
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,510
probably a zero day for Microsoft Office

493
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,120
which could be really nice finishing

494
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,460
touch to his career but if you look at

495
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,110
the movie he published I will save you

496
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,310
from watching the whole movie it's

497
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,850
terrible

498
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,950
but just a few screenshot he runs the

499
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,520
the world document and then he silently

500
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,370
switches of the micro switches on the

501
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,460
the the macro function and this is how

502
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,190
the silent exploit actually works and at

503
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,500
the end of the of the movie you get a

504
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,870
glimpse at his desktop where you could

505
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,870
actually identify all of his campaigns I

506
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,690
was talking about all of his malware of

507
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,540
all of his VPN providers all of his

508
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,760
databases he's using for spamming but

509
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,060
like actually everything's there and he

510
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,560
had a really solid profile on hack

511
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,040
forums until recently where he got

512
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,960
banned which is really sad for me

513
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,400
because I cannot follow him there

514
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,800
anymore and he probably got banned for

515
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,480
dealing with credit cards which which is

516
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,160
a big no-no on hack problems if you

517
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,380
don't want a big red cross from FBI on

518
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,060
your back you don't deal with credit

519
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,790
cards on the internet so he lost his

520
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,950
account on the same day his account was

521
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,140
closed curiosity drove 20 meters on a

522
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,730
new clue foot plateau in Mars taking

523
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,710
those beautiful pictures and I'm totally

524
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,350
not saying our guys our guy lives there

525
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,930
and

526
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,160
totally not saying these are his

527
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,240
pictures from Facebook profile and

528
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,280
there's an issue with with getting him

529
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,400
he's still active I'm not at liberty to

530
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,200
tell you everything I know about his

531
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,750
current campaigns because of what's

532
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,790
happening in the background but if you

533
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:20,330
see Vijay worm he was it's a dress rat

534
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,690
he was the second ever user to use it if

535
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,520
you see vortex of lateral ransomware

536
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,610
he's the only offer and user of it you

537
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,230
can be sure you're following my friend

538
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:33,440
and if you see something like a PDF that

539
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,660
tries to download the JavaScript the

540
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,210
tunnels and HD Fi the downloads and exit

541
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,190
which is an auto it which drops the drop

542
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,720
rate and drops a drop and that drops a

543
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,130
drop and then drops something you don't

544
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,530
recognize I'm sure it's him because he

545
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,530
doesn't understand it either he just use

546
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,630
it everything he can because because

547
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,180
apparently the mall shoppers and script

548
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,190
eyes you used the better anti detection

549
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:01,430
in in antivirus product is and he's

550
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,670
history at Raj it's really complex issue

551
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:09,010
and his history world and what he does

552
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:14,650
does not qualify him for European

553
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:19,430
warrant yet and polish Polish

554
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,470
prosecutors are working on the case so I

555
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,370
hope next year

556
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,500
I'll be able to show you some more

557
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,390

558
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,820

559
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,670
his Raj I need to thank all the people

560
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:34,580
that allowed me to make this show

561
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,250
possible security guys from hosting

562
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,650
companies from banks from side teams and

563
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,330
from especially from South Poland

564
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,910
because they were great and I think

565
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,110

566
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,500
