1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,939
good afternoon everyone welcome back in

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:05,160
the Red Room virus militant we will

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,420
continue the program here with a

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,970
presentation but before we continue I

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,460
know that like me you use cell phones

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,530
and you make calls when there's a break

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,420
so please put them back to silent so we

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,510
don't interrupt the speakers thank you

9
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,130
we have freeze presentations so this is

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,380
one and a half hours in total and the

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,750
first one is about the server malware a

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,430
server ransomware

13
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,630
9 circus or server by or Bechet and Jana

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,020
bomas from checkpoint software

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,850
technologies gentlemen thank you

16
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,989
hi everyone thanks for attending our

17
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,050
talk our talk is title is as you can see

18
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,570
nine circuits of server or the rise and

19
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,320
fall of a decryption service so first of

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,360
all introduce ourselves my name is Ian

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,610
Eve bulma's and I lead security research

22
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,280
for checkpoint software technologies

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,129
with me here on stages or a shed which

24
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,640
is a lead cyber threat analyst trade

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,040
intelligence analyst also walking for

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,890
checkpoint and a short disclaimer is

27
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,650
that this research was submitted to VB

28
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,530
and should have also been presented by

29
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,320
Stannis's Tanis loves karada which which

30
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,060
unfortunately couldn't be here so I'm

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,950
just a mere humble replacing a

32
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,930
replacement for him all the credit on

33
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,520
this work is all deserved to him now in

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,320
case you don't know or not familiar with

35
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,509
a checkpoint somewhere during less here

36
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:36,479
have published the decryption service

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,049
for server it was online was there for

38
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,140
what sometime we'll tell you more about

39
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,630
it soon but the thing is that we

40
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,340
actually never published the technical

41
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,500
details behind it and never said how did

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,790
we do it there were a lot of

43
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,979
speculations in the internet and in the

44
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,710
community like something saying that we

45
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,490
stole the global private key of server

46
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,799
or maybe we broke the encryption some of

47
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,930
them are more true than others but none

48
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,479
are actually correct and we figured that

49
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,179
VB would be the perfect stage for us to

50
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,430
reveal the technical details for the

51
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,380
first time it's no login irrelevant

52
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,270
but still the story behind it I guess is

53
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,790
pretty interesting so that's our talk

54
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,440
and let's begin thank you very much

55
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,880
and good day everyone thanks for

56
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,360
attending let's start with server the

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,820
malware ransomware no motivation to

58
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,760
address the problems it created so

59
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,010
server emerged last year and around the

60
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,040
late February with numerous infections

61
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,910
it's active since then and until today

62
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,800
it's one of the most prominent

63
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,290
ransomware out there in the wild they

64
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,870
both in infection wise and with its

65
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,720
capabilities it's very unique in the

66
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,630
term that it is the first fully success

67
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,540
success event successful a ransomware is

68
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,780
a service in the wild since its

69
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,220
appearance it had seven different

70
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,380
versions the last one emerged just a few

71
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,750
weeks ago always developing the latest

72
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,350
version has a crypto wallets thievery

73
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,380
and info stealing capabilities and so on

74
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:13,830
and so on

75
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,950
we'll focus today on the first version

76
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,320
in which we addressed and provided the

77
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,340
solution for so server is unique mostly

78
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,530
because of its business model being an

79
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,090
affiliate program a ransomware is a

80
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,760
service these two commercials are in

81
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,620
Russian in English addressing threat

82
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,740
actors to join the party the ransomware

83
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,990
party a new solution to monetize your

84
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,200
downloads it urges a threat actors to

85
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,810
join and to be a part of this ransomware

86
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,680
activity the advertisement continues

87
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,490
with the encryption scheme using server

88
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:52,740
the author is describing how the malware

89
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,790
works the specific encryption a process

90
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,880
and decryption providing a a full

91
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,490
technical overview showing that this is

92
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,620
a robust model that's supposed to be

93
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,020
very profitable with an automated

94
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,670
payment and a management system so he

95
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,250
advertised this model in order to

96
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,290
attract affiliates by the way today it's

97
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,940
the opposite II no longer attract them

98
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,980
it's a seller's market now it's fully

99
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,839
booked but back then he wanted to have

100
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,940
as many affiliates as much because you

101
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,650
are it ranked big you want it to be very

102
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,090
widespread

103
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,490
so the Phoenix program goes like this

104
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,890
each affiliate distribute the payload

105
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,870
and keep sixty percent of the profits

106
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,060
the profits are generated by the victims

107
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,480
who pay and it goes 40 percents to him

108
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,770
60 percent to them to the Philly 8a also

109
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,710
another 5% refer rate for recruiting new

110
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,650
participant in this term a server is

111
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,380
like the McDonald's of underworld

112
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,170
affiliates are getting a mature product

113
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,330
in which they just have to run heat and

114
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,990
play and enjoy the profits and it

115
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,180
creates a very unique situation for both

116
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,330
sides the author is on the right he has

117
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,040
no distribution efforts which is also

118
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,650
very good in object terms and it helps

119
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,720
him focus on designing code the stuff

120
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,820
that he does very well because he made a

121
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,860
very successful ransomware now we can

122
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,600
focus on how it's built and how it's

123
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,120
being developed even having less

124
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,870
partners in the core of the system also

125
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,150
he runs the revenue sharing he says what

126
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,430
happens he decides how the money split

127
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,380
between everyone on the Left we have the

128
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,870
affiliates they they distribute the

129
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,730
malware and once it's distributed all

130
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,350
they have to do is to wait to see who

131
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,140
pays and get their money zero management

132
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,510
this means that they don't have to have

133
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,790
technical skills of course some of them

134
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,790
are probably skilled and protectors as

135
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,919
well but this allows people with the bad

136
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,140
motivations to join the ransomware party

137
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,560
back then it was very high to join the

138
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,990
this activity without having to know how

139
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,210
to create a malware top tier malware and

140
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,030
this works very very well for both sides

141
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,040
and I think that this is a very

142
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,490
successful operation in another time

143
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,169
it's not just as a service like a

144
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,610
malware as a service tomorrow as a

145
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,590
service is like being a notorious

146
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,640
software developer

147
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,550
this guy is an entrepreneur he created a

148
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,050
new business model at least one of the

149
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,570
major reasons we were focused on

150
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,710
providing an answer for that so in his

151
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,020
advertisement he showed that between

152
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,770
half percent to 3 percent of victims pay

153
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,630
which is a bit higher than its it

154
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,300
release with an average payment of $500

155
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,910
back then it was one Bitcoin

156
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,560
approximately so if he didn't cash out

157
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,100
or date

158
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,140
cashout they would be extremely reached

159
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,120
by now of course he didn't lose any

160
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,440
motivation because of that is still

161
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,810
active and creating a lot of money and

162
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,000
they also said that the top countries to

163
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,070
pay our Australia Canada Great Britain

164
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,640
and the United States which is also

165
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,470
giving the smell of a successful

166
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,880
business running in the Western world

167
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,750
where there is money showing a lot of a

168
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,620
understanding how to attract affiliates

169
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,330
in as in his advertisement even gives

170
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,610
examples of successful campaigns because

171
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,020
he want to attract the affiliates as

172
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,760
much as possible so we have examples of

173
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,220
two campaigns lasting for about a month

174
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,030
each harvesting 30 something 250

175
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,040
something a thousand dollars each so

176
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,410
take the point of view of the affiliate

177
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,750
for a second he pays one thousand two

178
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,370
thousand dollars a month to have a

179
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,290
license for an exploit kit creating

180
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,720
landing pages each suite distribute the

181
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,090
money Adam always sorry and he gets the

182
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,970
money after that in 20 times higher sums

183
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,130
so this is a very good business for

184
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,890
everyone giving us a higher motivation

185
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,840
to find address this and provide a

186
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,640
solution so we started digging deeper

187
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,130
thanks or so at this stage at least from

188
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,730
research perspective we are engaged in a

189
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,190
fully fledged research project into

190
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,070
server looking into many many points in

191
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,600
it and trying to figure out a lot of

192
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,870
things but I guess the most important

193
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,660
one and actually my personal favor I

194
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,940
mean the most important one in in my

195
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,490
eyes is to try and figure out some kind

196
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,700
of a solution to help users decrypt the

197
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,730
server encrypted files so obviously in

198
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,250
order to do that we need to first dig in

199
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,260
and understand the exact server

200
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,200
encryption scheme and how does it

201
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,970
actually work so that's why we prepared

202
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,890
this server encryption for dummies it's

203
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,409
not complete but it shows you the

204
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:36,390
picture and all the important the parts

205
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,340
in it so what happens when you get

206
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,409
infected with server well first of all

207
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:43,169
you get the the sample the the server

208
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,120
executable and on to your system it

209
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,070
contains of course all the logic and

210
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,840
everything but most importantly for the

211
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,820
encryption scheme is that it contains

212
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,420
the RSA master public key in it in bed

213
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,670
inside the configuration block inside of

214
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,250
server and this is of course just one

215
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,370
half of the RSA keeper the other half of

216
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,310
it is the so-called golden key the RSA

217
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,139
master private key and it's the sole

218
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:10,230
property of the server author it must be

219
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,880
because otherwise this encryption scheme

220
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,699
doesn't he's not really good

221
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:18,600
so when server starts is activated when

222
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,220
you computed on your computer on the

223
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,510
victim's computer when it starts running

224
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,639
then obviously the first thing it does

225
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,680
it starts to extract files from the

226
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,449
system and he extracts them from

227
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:29,279
everywhere from local drives from

228
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,170
network drives from removable drives

229
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,149
basically wherever you can find files

230
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:35,579
from it takes them and it takes them

231
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:37,199
extracts them one by one

232
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:39,360
so let's take a look at this file file X

233
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,269
as an example it takes it and now he

234
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:44,310
wants to encrypt this file so in order

235
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,440
to do that he uses a PRNG

236
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,810
embedded again inside the sir inside the

237
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:49,769
sample itself

238
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:51,690
PRN Jeeps weather or random number

239
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,820
generator doesn't really matter what it

240
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,889
is they think the to note here is that

241
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:58,050
this thing is used to generate some

242
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,820
extra keys needed for the encryption

243
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,100
scheme and the first set of keys that is

244
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,720
generated is another set of RSA keys

245
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,370
public and private key but this time

246
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,130
it's a local set okay so there's one of

247
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,740
these keepers is generated per victim

248
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,410
per host actually so each host has its

249
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,440
own set of RSA keys right and then the

250
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,180
second thing that's being generated and

251
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,310
did that's actually being generated per

252
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,550
file is another key a symmetric key this

253
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,610
time it's an rc4 key and it corresponds

254
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,640
to each file so file X has its own rc4 X

255
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,740
key and file why will it will have our

256
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,560
c4 Y key and so on and so on and that's

257
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,610
it that's all the keys in this in this

258
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,829
game and what happens now is that server

259
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:46,500
splits the file into sections it does

260
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,050
this based on file size and stuff like

261
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,819
that but it's not really important the

262
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:52,290
important thing to understand it

263
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,930
it's various sections per file and then

264
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,000
each of these sections is being

265
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,029
encrypted using the rc4 key right so we

266
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:02,250
have like three sections each of them

267
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,800
encrypted with our c4 and that's it now

268
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,019
the file is encrypted right we can see

269
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:07,710
it's

270
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,350
but we only meet the rc4 key to open it

271
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,840
so obviously the rc4 key is taken and

272
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,930
then encrypted using the local RSA

273
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,840
public key / and the product of this

274
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,220
encryption is just appended to the end

275
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,350
of the file right at this point we only

276
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,510
need the RSA key pair in order to

277
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,840
reverse the process so again obviously

278
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,060
the RSA master public key is taken and

279
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,600
it encrypts our local RSA key / and

280
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,670
again the product of this encryption is

281
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,280
appended to the end of the file so now

282
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,080
everything is deleted from disk from

283
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,240
memory we have no more of this original

284
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,400
keys generated and we are left with an

285
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,010
encrypted file with two encrypted keys

286
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,020
at the end of it right we have nothing

287
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,540
to do we can't open it and that's the

288
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,280
encryption scheme now if you understood

289
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,020
this then decryption should be trivial

290
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,330
because it's just the same only in

291
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,330
Reverse but just to make it clear server

292
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,640
has his server out there in the internet

293
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,410
somewhere hidden behind the Tor network

294
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,600
so we don't know anything about it we

295
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,950
can't figure out where it is

296
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,460
but we do know that this like server

297
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,070
cloud where the thing contains the RSA

298
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,020
master private key the so-called golden

299
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,570
key used to decrypt everything and the

300
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,120
process needed to decrypt this is just

301
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,390
to send this encrypted RSA key / the

302
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,570
local one to be decrypted by the master

303
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,300
private key in the in the cloud and then

304
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,180
the RSA local private key again just one

305
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,490
of these per each victim is being sent

306
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,410
back to the victim and now it's being

307
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,350
used to decrypt each of the rc4 keys and

308
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,960
now that we have the rc4 key it's not a

309
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,540
problem we can just decrypt the files

310
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,640
same same thing just backwards and we

311
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,770
have our original file everything is

312
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,520
good finally the file is restored and

313
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,690
that's actually perfect

314
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,360
so during the past I guess few years

315
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,970
I've had the opportunity to take a look

316
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,160
at quite a few encryption algorithms of

317
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,810
brands were not ransomware

318
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,580
and stuff like that and I can say

319
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,830
personally that first of all the crypto

320
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,380
logic inside this thing is perfect there

321
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,360
is no flaw there everything is good

322
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,670
there is no way to break it and actually

323
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,260
I think this is one of my favorite

324
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,620
encryption schemes because it has quite

325
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,690
a few nice properties like

326
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,870
for example the survey autos offer like

327
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,660
yeah we'll open one file for you just to

328
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,940
showcase that we can open it and all he

329
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,200
needs to do in order to do that is just

330
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,520
to get one encrypted file

331
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,470
he already has all the keys in there so

332
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,760
it's not a problem you can just do it

333
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,130
and said you BEC your decrypted the file

334
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,140
say yeah look I can do it now give me

335
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,370
the money so it's very nice and

336
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:48,000
completely unbreakable in my mind so

337
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,700
basically what the NIV says is a stop

338
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,620
you wasted my time this is very solid

339
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,030
very robust no point in to digging

340
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,220
further inside so should we give up

341
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,420
should we leave this a untouched so we

342
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,180
didn't want to leave it we wanted to dig

343
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,920
further we remember that a survey is not

344
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,720
only an encryption decryption process

345
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,130
it's also a new kind of a dark operation

346
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,860
a new kind of business model and maybe

347
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,710
we'll find if we zoom out we'll find the

348
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,280
answer

349
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,550
located somewhere else so we already

350
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,400
know how life looks like for the

351
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,200
affiliates and their author let's try

352
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,700
and follow the experience of a victim so

353
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,010
we have this guy you can see he said by

354
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,590
said face why is he sad because it was

355
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,210
infected with server all his files are

356
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,660
not encrypted and he's devastated and he

357
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,730
wants to see what's required in order to

358
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,680
retrieve them he enters the link inside

359
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,290
the ransom note he enters this this

360
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,410
portal this is the real portal of server

361
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,240
urging him to pay in order to get the

362
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,160
key in order to restore all his files

363
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,580
and to answer his own problem this

364
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,410
portal now splits it there is a

365
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,420
crossroad it leads into two different

366
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,300
locations logically first of all is a

367
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,490
Bitcoin wallet generated specifically

368
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,860
for this victim in order to pay because

369
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,990
the payment is necessary if he pays and

370
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,120
doesn't get the files back then he has

371
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,430
no motivation if he doesn't pay and get

372
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,290
the files then the author has no

373
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,420
motivation so this is very much required

374
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,140
another thing is a the download of the

375
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,720
Decrypter of server which isn't a

376
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,410
general or generic executable it doesn't

377
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,010
necessarily

378
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,770
to download it from this portal it's the

379
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,590
same decrypter for all victims and now

380
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,050
after this crossroad when one side is

381
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,820
responsible for the money and the other

382
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,410
one is responsible for the decryption

383
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,870
there must be some kind of connection

384
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,450
between the two but what is the

385
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,040
connection and maybe there will find

386
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,090
something interesting yeah so the

387
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,040
question that always is actually I guess

388
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,450
the biggest question is the missing link

389
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,670
here because there must be some kind of

390
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,220
connection between the payment and the

391
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,570
actual decryption scheme because

392
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,700
otherwise how does this thing work there

393
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,700
must be something so I guess at this

394
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,560
point of time this was our main mission

395
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,210
trying to find out this missing link

396
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,340
what it is now how is it actually being

397
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,600
done by server and in order to do that

398
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,040
naturally the first thing to look at is

399
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,800
this like portal that or mentioned

400
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,630
before this is the port of the you you

401
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,160
get the link to once you get infected

402
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,770
and there's actually two interesting

403
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,960
pieces of information in here they are

404
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:39,270
here in here in very small text but if

405
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,940
we'll take a closer look at them then

406
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,290
you see that at least one of them is

407
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,300
very obvious and that's the bottom one

408
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,370
because that's just a Bitcoin wallet

409
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,400
it's a unique Bitcoin wallet so a unique

410
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,290
Bitcoin wallet is generated on a per

411
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,570
victim basis right that makes sense and

412
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,160
we see that in a lot of a lot of

413
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,900
ransomware not all of them but a lot of

414
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,170
them that's easy but what is the top one

415
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,450
so we see that if we run this on on

416
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,760
different hosts we get a different ID

417
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,760
there so call ID so we kind of guessed

418
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,230
this is like something like a unique

419
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,390
victim ID it must be a unique victim ID

420
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,040
but how is this unique victim ID

421
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,410
connected to the Bitcoin wallet we still

422
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,020
don't know and we try to look look this

423
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,569
up in the by reversing the Decrypter

424
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:23,640
application and we find out that the

425
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,930
answer is pretty simple

426
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,630
this unique victim ID is the product of

427
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,230
the same RSA local keys that we saw

428
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,420
before right some kind of product some

429
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,460
kind of processing of this and and and

430
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,130
actually that's pretty much what we were

431
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,770
looking for because you see this thing

432
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,750
is now directly connected to the Bitcoin

433
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,360
wallet on one hand and on the other hand

434
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,380
each and every encrypted file has

435
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,080
this keeper encrypted no but it is there

436
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,410
at the end of the file so we can

437
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,480
directly draw a line between each file

438
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,540
and the unique Bitcoin wallet so that's

439
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,120
what enables the server author to

440
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,310
actually validate that you or the victim

441
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,470
paid the money he takes the keys it

442
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,940
takes a look at the Bitcoin wallet

443
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,260
corresponding to them if there's money

444
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,040
there then everything is okay right so

445
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,900
that's that's that the thing and now if

446
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,780
we take again a step back and take a

447
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,640
look at the entire process it makes

448
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,010
makes much more sense right now you see

449
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,440
that the crypto application is all set

450
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,270
it's just a stupid application contains

451
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,370
no special logic in it what all it does

452
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,590
it just picks up a random encrypted file

453
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,170
from the system takes it takes out the

454
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,360
keys from it and sends it to the cloud

455
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,760
right and if everything checks out then

456
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,670
you'll get him back your your private

457
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,800
key and you can do all this decryption

458
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,650
process that I told you and this thing

459
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:49,040
is actually done simply over HTTP this

460
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,720
is the request being sent by the

461
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,360
Decrypter application right an

462
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,980
interesting thing to note here that

463
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,440
you're not the Decrypter is not limited

464
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,890
to one request per the host it actually

465
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,530
can send as many requests as you want

466
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,200
that's how it was designed and the

467
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,090
request is split into three major

468
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,970
sections so there is a capture which I

469
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,470
don't have anything to say about it just

470
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,010
the capture and then there is a unique

471
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,050
ID the same unique ID that we sold on

472
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,240
the top of the portal and then the final

473
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,730
parameter is just encrypted keys right

474
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,740
so that's all that's being sent to the

475
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,140
server side and what happens on the

476
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,690
server side obviously we can tell

477
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,640
because it's on the server side but now

478
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,110
that we know all this process we can

479
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,580
pretty much speculate what's the

480
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,500
algorithm required in order to do this

481
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,570
so first thing that needs to be done the

482
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,820
capture needs to be validated of course

483
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,430
that's okay and then the unique ID has

484
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,350
to be verified and to see that the

485
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,060
corresponding wallet actually has the

486
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,220
money that supposed to be there and the

487
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,900
third thing that should be done is to

488
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,190
check that the encrypted key actually

489
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,370
belongs to the same victim whose unique

490
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,010
ID this is right that's pretty much it

491
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,380
if I would develop it that's the checks

492
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,370
that I will do

493
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,460
and okay it looks trivial to us but

494
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,680
still you know we're kind of playing

495
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,970
around with the idea and saying okay

496
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,880
let's try to check them one by one so

497
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,930
validating the CAPTCHA is easy we just

498
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,030
cigarette send the rock capture and get

499
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,220
nothing back and checking the unique ID

500
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,050
again is easy we just fabricate some

501
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,360
kind of unique ID and again get nothing

502
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,120
back but an encrypted key so how can we

503
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,910
check the encrypted key so we were just

504
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,040
you know laughing between ourselves and

505
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,559
thinking okay so what will happen if I

506
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,020
will send a request with a valid unique

507
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,850
ID of somebody who actually paid the

508
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,190
money but I will send the keys from a

509
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,770
totally different victim just someone

510
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,240
else who didn't pay even one single

511
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,370
dollar to this guy what will happen and

512
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,600
we were saying yeah no chance of course

513
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,490
I mean it will be checked and we will

514
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,550
get nothing bet back but guess what no

515
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,160
yes we got valid keys back so this guy

516
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,650
forgot a simple validation check on they

517
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,020
on the third thing so this means this

518
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,900
actually means that by taking a you a

519
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,320
valid unique ID once we can decrypt

520
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,370
everybody's file so it's a decryption

521
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,990
party that we can now do and that's very

522
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,230
cool that's a very I would say stupid

523
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,750
bug or a very minor bug but still it's a

524
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,720
very fatal bargain this completely ruins

525
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,700
the entire business process of the

526
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,100
server guy and that's a great win for us

527
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,040
I guess we can now make this decryption

528
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,280
application and just start opening

529
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,530
everybody's files due to this simple

530
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,010
mistake thank you

531
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,080
so actually the author created an option

532
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,700
for a family subscription to the

533
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,790
decryption service unknowingly and as it

534
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,179
said it's a very minor bug but it's a

535
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,520
very important bug I got these in the

536
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,870
details and this is enough for us to

537
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,179
provide solution for everyone everyone

538
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:51,830
who was infected like that version of a

539
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,160
server so we wanted to provide the

540
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,260
solution somehow to victims and where

541
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,809
the dilemma because this is a very minor

542
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:00,830
flaw

543
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,870
once the author finds out about it he

544
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,240
will fix it's very like in its it will

545
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,309
be terms of minutes maybe hours until

546
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:09,380
it's done and then we were in real

547
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,390
problem in the guy he will find it

548
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,550
because this is his malware he coded it

549
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,279
and

550
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:15,899
is there not better programming at all

551
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:17,519
so once the understood that something is

552
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,909
wrong it'll deal with it so we had two

553
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:23,309
major options on how to deal with it

554
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,229
the first of all was creating an

555
00:22:25,229 --> 00:22:27,330
application a standalone decryption tool

556
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,969
downloadable from the internet for every

557
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:34,909
victim in which the appendix of the

558
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:38,009
prepaid Bitcoin wallet of another victim

559
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:41,700
will be attached to this say a victim ID

560
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,149
and that's how the victim will decrypt

561
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:47,039
these files but in this case the author

562
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,190
will download the tool himself and play

563
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,229
with it reverse it and eventually you

564
00:22:52,229 --> 00:22:56,759
will find out the flow very quickly the

565
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,440
other one was to create a web decrypt or

566
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,929
web-based application you remember in

567
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:02,909
the part is cussing that encryption

568
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:05,190
decryption the communication is weeding

569
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,289
in fact that files would encrypted files

570
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:09,989
because they all have the keys in them

571
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:13,200
appended in the end so every victim can

572
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,369
send an encrypted file and get back the

573
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:18,989
decryption key from the portal this is

574
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:21,450
what we decided to do and even in this

575
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,789
case it was obvious that eventually the

576
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:25,979
threat actor will find out what we did

577
00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:28,169
and how we did it and the door will be

578
00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:30,299
shut and you wanted to get as much time

579
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:31,859
as possible in order to help as many

580
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:34,289
victims as possible so this is why we

581
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:38,759
chose this a vector of activity and we

582
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:40,649
think that we did a very good job

583
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:43,679
we created this a web portal web-based

584
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,599
application for decryption it was

585
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,999
running for 48 hours successfully and we

586
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:50,969
allowed thousands of a victims to

587
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:53,070
restore their files and this is very

588
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,499
successful eventually the author found

589
00:23:55,499 --> 00:24:00,330
out about what we did this is a yeah

590
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,879
this is the Decrypter of the Bitcoin

591
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:04,739
wallet had already paid in the past and

592
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:07,529
that we took a ride with and eventually

593
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,929
he found it in his site in the server

594
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:13,109
side after I guess digging and for those

595
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:16,320
a 48 hours without any sleep and he sent

596
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,999
us these things fixed a notification and

597
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:23,309
even with a smiley and so by that time

598
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:26,870
it was done still we were able to create

599
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,509
very large impact we got very positive

600
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:34,039
feedbacks from victims saying that it

601
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,990
was very successful and they restored

602
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,029
their files and it's all it's very

603
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:39,769
important to remember for us we're from

604
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,779
the industry we know what ransomware is

605
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:44,389
it's very unpleasant for people that

606
00:24:44,389 --> 00:24:46,730
don't know much about cybersecurity and

607
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,799
they get into that position in the first

608
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,080
place because they don't understand the

609
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,990
risk once it happens it's very very poor

610
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:57,230
and having their files restored this is

611
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,389
something very very impressive very

612
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:01,190
enormous thing that are overwhelmed by

613
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:05,470
the success so we believe that we had a

614
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,840
very much successful operation so the

615
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,279
summary the ending point of this

616
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,289
conversation first of all we realized

617
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:14,059
that the solid encryption is not a game

618
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:16,369
over in the process and there is always

619
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:18,830
something else to look for in every

620
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,529
threat operation there is also always a

621
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:23,659
weak link in the chain that we can look

622
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:26,899
for and it's always there second of all

623
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:28,850
it's about creativity in the work

624
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,220
process it's sometimes easier to break

625
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,869
the Decrypter but rather than the

626
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:34,940
decryption itself and that was the case

627
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,149
in this incident last but not the least

628
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:40,669
we were very proud of it at the end of

629
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:42,889
the day we managed to save thousands of

630
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:45,110
users and millions of files and the

631
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,830
zillion of bits of encrypted the

632
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:51,440
information and also to have a severe

633
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,470
effect over the reputation of this model

634
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,590
and threat actor and we believe that we

635
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,799
did very good job we're very proud of so

636
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,570
thank you very much for listening and

637
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,700
now we're open to questions
