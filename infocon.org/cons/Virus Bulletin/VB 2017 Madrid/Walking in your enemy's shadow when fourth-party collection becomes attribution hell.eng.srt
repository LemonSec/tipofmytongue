1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,170
all right thanks everyone for your

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,449
patience and we can go ahead with the

3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:08,000
second presentation good all right

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,650
everybody settle in good morning good

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,570
morning well good good afternoon

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,269
actually good afternoon everybody

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,480
so I'm a little sadder this is my

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,630
partner in crime mr. Costa dry oh it is

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,039
not the first time we've gotten to share

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,230
the stage at bebe which I think it's

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,490
kind of exciting for us to do this

12
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,449
together again but in any case I'm a big

13
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,488
fan of EB we're both very big fans of

14
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:34,079
ours bullets and specifically because we

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,690
kind of get to take a little more time

16
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,059
to address some complex subjects in our

17
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,620
industry it's really easy to get caught

18
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,559
up in in writing a four-page blogpost

19
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,050
and seizing the story and saying hey we

20
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,610
were the first ones to find this and

21
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,140
then you just kind of walk away and

22
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,719
leave it there and there are things that

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,370
are a little more complex that are

24
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,559
really relevant to our nascent industry

25
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,600
and that need a little more time to

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,199
treat that now that's my way of kind of

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,619
couching this specifically for the Q&A

28
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,750
section because we've written a really

29
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,479
long extensive paper on this subject

30
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,780
it's a really complicated subject and I

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,010
hope that for those of you that are

32
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,150
interested that you'll take the time to

33
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,290
read it and maybe we can shoot some

34
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,880
emails back and forth or continue the

35
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,400
conversation but in any case rather than

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,979
trying to compress a really really large

37
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,710
subject into 20 minutes we were hoping

38
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,720
to actually have more of a discussion

39
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,909
bring out some stories bring out some

40
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:31,560
examples that are not in the paper some

41
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,820
things that I think could be really

42
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,100
really interesting to talk about and

43
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,040
sort of make this more of an enriching

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,150
appendix to this maybe were in a certain

45
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,060
way for those of you that were with us

46
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,060
last year a Brian Bartholomew and I did

47
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,710
paper on on false flags that some of you

48
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,630
actually gave us very kind comments on

49
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,790
and that alone was kind of our way of

50
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,890
saying listen attribution is really

51
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,750
complicated not only is it complicated

52
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,700
but the reason that we're having such a

53
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,439
hard time with it is it's testing the

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,880
limits of what we can know and threat

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,759
intelligence and what we can assert with

56
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,479
confidence this is essentially a next

57
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,010
step project of saying

58
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,349
well let's see just exactly where the

59
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:16,300
boundary is of what we can and cannot

60
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,239
know and to rely on a very esoteric and

61
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,190
complex practice and intelligence that

62
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:25,720
is relevant to that to summarize it in

63
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,090
like a very short way every year we're

64
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,420
getting into more and more trouble this

65
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,760
year obviously we want to continue in

66
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,980
this direction but like just a few words

67
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,890
about our sponsor or the team that we're

68
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,800
part of we're from the global research

69
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,800
and analysis team at Kaspersky Lab we

70
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,100
have about 40 people in 17 countries

71
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,880
specializing in game really

72
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,030
sophisticated threats so we're looking

73
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,500
into apts we're doing threat

74
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,150
intelligence we're doing all sorts of

75
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,220
stuff and I'm sure you guys probably

76
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,350
remember some of the research that we

77
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,970
have published here in the last year's

78
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,580
maybe I don't things such as a projects

79
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,489
our own strong PD through the arm or

80
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:10,390
scar craft dark hotel this is about 10%

81
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,140
of maybe what we have published I guess

82
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,500
so

83
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,700
when let's say did all this start there

84
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,850
was like a long time ago in this galaxy

85
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,980
somewhere in the Middle East where all

86
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,160
the fun stuff happens nowadays there was

87
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,980
a research institute and these guys from

88
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,480
the research institute they had like a

89
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,600
really old pc and that really old pc

90
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,030
this is just an example it's not this

91
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,400
one exactly an IBM has nothing to do it

92
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,609
just it was a very very old PC was in

93
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:45,160
fact it pretty much by all high end

94
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,170
stuff that we have seen during all this

95
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,900
year they had to Orla it had a Reagan it

96
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,790
had flame it had animal farm it had

97
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,579
correcto and he had maybe something else

98
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,829
and one of my colleagues actually found

99
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:59,560
this something else he sent me a sample

100
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,329
and he said dude I think this is a tour

101
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:03,880
la driver can you confirm I looked at

102
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,840
the driver over the name was perf and W

103
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,850
and it didn't look like Turla to me you

104
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,620
guys know what it was anybody has an

105
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,859
idea what was it what was it

106
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:18,370
yeah what was it what was it can you

107
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:24,510
yell what was it yell Paul yeah was it

108
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,610
I see someone with a mic alright it was

109
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,830
something else and that's something else

110
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,830
you know it was the first driver of

111
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,240
equation from the equation group that we

112
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,940
found and we made a signature for that

113
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,890
and found more we made signatures on

114
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,810
those and we found more and further

115
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,340
signatures and more and we found like

116
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,310
hundreds of samples but that got us kind

117
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,250
of thinking and we realized that why are

118
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,040
there so many apt is overlapping on one

119
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,040
machine perhaps everybody is interested

120
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,850
in to whatever these scientists research

121
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,790
on that machine considering like the

122
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,310
country profile the geopolitical context

123
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,320
what's happening in the world kind of

124
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,680
maybe make sense but also we know that

125
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,260
apt groups watch for each other's

126
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,870
implants on the same machine so they are

127
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,510
aware that other apt groups can be on

128
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,690
the same machine and actually some of

129
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,660
the best have actually developed

130
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,700
antivirus products an apt level

131
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,470
antivirus products that run on their

132
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,960
victims machines to kick the other

133
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,110
groups out of those machines which is

134
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,930
pretty cool or maybe we're thinking that

135
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,800
perhaps this group is just watching what

136
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,110
the others are doing and they saw that

137
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,060
you know all the cool kids in town are

138
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,550
infecting this guy in the Institute and

139
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,320
how come that we're not the cool kids we

140
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,330
need to infect this guy as well like

141
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,130
just you know this process in which

142
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,370
everybody ends up infecting this poor

143
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,870
Research Institute maybe they're not

144
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,030
doing anything but it's just you know

145
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,210
like a peer pressure apt peer pressure

146
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:07,260
alright so the question of course they

147
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,060
were wondering but are these groups

148
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,610
truly aware of what they're doing there

149
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,960
and they are they aware of each other

150
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,900
and do they actually if one of them is

151
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,090
taking something from the machine are

152
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,370
the others taking it as well so that's

153
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,870
how it all started right so we talked

154
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,340
about you know we're sort of trying to

155
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,140
focus on what fourth party collection is

156
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,630
gonna do for our understanding of cyber

157
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,340
operations and what our research can and

158
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,050
cannot do but in order to get to

159
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,310
understand what fourth party collection

160
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,060
is we basically have to go

161
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,880
and get a sense of the different

162
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,520
categories of what signals intelligence

163
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,550
collection might be and essentially

164
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,800
these are categorized by the

165
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,810
relationship between the collector and

166
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,510
the generator of the data so the first

167
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,760
party collection obviously if we we

168
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,860
created this mythical entity we're gonna

169
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,020
call agency a and we're also going to

170
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,400
talk about agency B which is sort of

171
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,740
like the the lesser actor that gets

172
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,290
picked on all the time so agency a

173
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,910
whenever agency a goes and collects

174
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,980
something on their own first hand that's

175
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,980
first party collection agency a has

176
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,440
friends other very cool agencies that

177
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,300
share information with agency a that's

178
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,310
second party collection you know our

179
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,980
friends have provided us with this thing

180
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,600
third party collection means hey agency

181
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,470
a either has partnerships or has access

182
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,460
to from whatever reason to hosting

183
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,560
providers ISPs companies that generally

184
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,970
already possess a lot of information on

185
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,940
users so this is the sort of third party

186
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,400
collection you say okay I'm part of this

187
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,460
hosting this hosting provider there's a

188
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,680
CNC on that hosting provider or there's

189
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,060
already data about a user on that

190
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,310
hosting provider obviously agency a can

191
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,140
leverage that so what is fourth party

192
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,540
collection fourth party collection is a

193
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,880
far more complicated thing in a certain

194
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,610
sense it is essentially when one group

195
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,740
intercepts the communications or finds

196
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,650
access in a certain way of another group

197
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,220
that happens to be collecting on a set

198
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,180
of victims so by virtue of doing that

199
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,990
agency a is also collecting on agency

200
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,180
bees victims it's a little complicated I

201
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,510
know it's still early we're gonna work

202
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,740
through this we're gonna walk through

203
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,800
this we're gonna be fine take me back

204
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,630
just for a second it's okay but just to

205
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,980
keep in mind there are two types of

206
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,900
fourth party collection there's passive

207
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,340
fourth party collection which is to say

208
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,870
I have access

209
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,640
ANCA is a god on the wires they have

210
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,590
access to all the you know Internet

211
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,659
infrastructure in a given region so of

212
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,920
course they're seeing things that are

213
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,360
traveling across the wire they don't

214
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,590
need to put their hand in it they're

215
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,420
just collecting and that's enough for

216
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,000
them to see operations that

217
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,550
travel across those wires active fourth

218
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,070
party collection is to say you know I'm

219
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,930
running a cyber espionage operation

220
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,060
Koston wants to see the things that I'm

221
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,640
collecting Koston pops my command and

222
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,910
control server and he gets access to my

223
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,710
victims things like that this is an

224
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,900
oversimplification like I said a long

225
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,210
long paper you can go check it out but

226
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,950
essentially that's fourth party there's

227
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,330
fifth party but you have to buy us

228
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,970
drinks after the talk is that's that's

229
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,790
getting a little too far into the weeds

230
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,220
so like I said we're gonna focus on

231
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,660
examples and I think it's actually a

232
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,400
little more valuable because there's a

233
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,600
lot of technical ease and a lot of

234
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,490
different possibilities that we could

235
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,020
get sucked into and I don't think that's

236
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,240
quite gonna prove as interesting so in

237
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,430
order to really get us through the

238
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,750
subject we figured we would do some

239
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,360
public examples of what I'd like to

240
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,070
refer to as intelligence piggybacking

241
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,840
more specifically rather than just

242
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,670
fourth party collection then we're gonna

243
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,320
talk about things that were entirely

244
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,840
unpublished until now the moment we get

245
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,150
off stage you know the paper is in your

246
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,280
hands it's gonna go out there and you

247
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,750
can see examples of things that we had

248
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,310
never published before but that now we

249
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,980
want to be able to discuss and you know

250
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,450
if we have time and everybody's cool

251
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,130
then maybe we'll go through some bonuses

252
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,810
you know some cool stuff that we're not

253
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,810
kind of published at all so like I said

254
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,460
public examples of intelligence

255
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,470
piggybacking let's let's say that we're

256
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,540
trying to understand what intelligence

257
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,070
agencies do between each other this is

258
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,480
the same dynamics that we're gonna see

259
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,660
end up playing out on the cyber you know

260
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,270
on the fifth domain so this is one that

261
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,380
I thought was really interesting there

262
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,200
was an article quite recently about how

263
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,910
certain intelligence agencies have

264
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,240
mounted a great you know signal

265
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,920
intelligence post and what they're doing

266
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,040
is rather than trying to track targets

267
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,520
on the ground they're actually tracking

268
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,710
Israeli drones that are tracking those

269
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,420
targets on the ground and collecting the

270
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,890
feeds and collecting the video and

271
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,440
thereby collecting not only intelligence

272
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,620
on what this other Intelligence Agency

273
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,760
is doing but also having an

274
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,170
understanding of how weapons are being

275
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,870
deployed where the actors might be which

276
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,620
makes you think you know if there are

277
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,170
intelligence agencies that have a

278
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,459
purview over a given region and

279
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:03,720
obviously they're gonna have regional

280
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,350
knowledge

281
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,870
that you know others might not if you're

282
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,100
in Israel if you're in the Middle East

283
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,020
if you're in Latin America you're much

284
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,550
more you speak the language you're much

285
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,480
more likely to have a greater

286
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,430
understanding of things on the ground of

287
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,990
networks on the ground of cultural

288
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,880
dynamics so if you're a global

289
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,590
intelligence agency that needs to

290
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,790
basically have a hand at an AI

291
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,460
everywhere it makes a lot more sense to

292
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,740
essentially recruit a translator recruit

293
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,330
somebody that's culturally embedded

294
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,330
whether they like it or not so that's

295
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,680
the way that I like to see it you know

296
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,750
your drones or our drones or everybody's

297
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:38,640
drones other examples this one gets us a

298
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,050
little closer to the cyber and actually

299
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,210
something a lot closer to my heart in

300
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,770
our heart because of a work that we've

301
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,410
done recently how many of you are

302
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,680
familiar with makers mark the I see a

303
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,080
couple hands I think the two in the

304
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,610
front are probably more familiar with a

305
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,370
different type of maker's mark I think

306
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,510
this is actually pretty cool because

307
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,850
there's a so this is from one of the

308
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,440
Snowden you know southern docks and

309
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,210
actually I think my favorite yeah so

310
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,820
they're describing not just makers mark

311
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,490
but essentially their understanding of

312
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,310
the maker's mark operators and and a lot

313
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,270
of the operations how they were

314
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,650
conducted how they were designed and how

315
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,970
they were Mis employed and this is us

316
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,740
reading a lot into these powerpoints

317
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,760
because it's just a bunch of little

318
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,980
bullets but what I really like is it's a

319
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,360
confirmation of fourth party collection

320
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,210
actually happening and it's it tells a

321
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,890
really interesting story about how this

322
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,830
happened so this would be an example of

323
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,230
passive fourth party collection the idea

324
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,400
is there's an implant shop there's a set

325
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,560
of developers that are creating the

326
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,030
malware for maker's mark they happen to

327
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:50,820
be infected by the The Gambler botnet

328
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,960
for those of you older than I you might

329
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:01,350
remember these guys from 2007 and then

330
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,720
this gum blur malware happens to be

331
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,150
exfiltrating some stuff and our friends

332
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,830
were lucky enough to say hey you know

333
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,210
the information is already on the wire

334
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,490
let's collect on them so like I said for

335
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,930
those of you that might you know the

336
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,550
front is familiar with a certain type of

337
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,610
maker's mark for everybody else makers

338
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,720
mark as actually something that you

339
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,860
might find a whole lot more familiar

340
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,920
especially Paul in the back is actually

341
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:35,850
Turla or venom bear or snake snake and

342
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,930
some of you might have seen our work

343
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,060
recently on moonlight maze that's

344
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,190
actually where the mmm the name actually

345
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,990
starts out and if you can see this is

346
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,610
from the same Snowden document from

347
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,610
replicant farm which is a certain actors

348
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,760
a V that gets deployed along with their

349
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,710
apt so that they can create generate

350
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,170
intelligence from victim boxes so you

351
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,660
can see actually the MM moniker

352
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,600
alongside things like carbon and some of

353
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,460
those AFD Isis file names that you might

354
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,040
recognize from asian BTC inter law it's

355
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,750
essentially you know for people that

356
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,490
have been around for that long 20 years

357
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,580
of the same code names so like I

358
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,930
mentioned you know gum blurs already

359
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,820
infected these guys gum blur is already

360
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,990
exfiltrating information on them and our

361
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,910
friends have decided to not waste their

362
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,020
time and instead collect that

363
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,280
information and it's actually quite

364
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,170
interesting because without ever

365
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,600
touching the box without ever putting

366
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,310
their own malware in it without ever

367
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,590
showing their hand they were able to

368
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,210
collect information on the developers

369
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,470
they mentioned that they you know there

370
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,910
were things like live journal accounts

371
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,400
so you actually have you basically Docs

372
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,720
the developers without ever touching

373
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,550
their machines so it's a very

374
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,110
interesting dynamic of what's going on

375
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:48,570
here all right very interesting case

376
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,980
that we saw recently in the vol 7 dumps

377
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,740
there is the case of Express line so

378
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,510
what is Express line is a very

379
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,570
interesting implant which is installed

380
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,000
during a normal upgrade so what happens

381
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,120
here intelligence agency has friends all

382
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,100
around the world so they let's say give

383
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,380
them either for free or they sell them

384
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,810
some software which allows them to track

385
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:16,740
bad people so different agencies around

386
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,480
the world let's say here in Spain are

387
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,640
using this software to track bad people

388
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,470
so what do they do they collect your

389
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,450
fingerprints when you come here so for

390
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,490
instance if you have an electronic

391
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,770
passport and you came here in Spain you

392
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:29,449
could use

393
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:30,529
passport than they ask for your

394
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,809
fingerprint all that stuff goes into a

395
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:34,639
system and there is processed by a

396
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,319
software and the software of course

397
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:38,869
makes a copy of your photo passport and

398
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:41,059
the fingerprints so what happens is the

399
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:43,819
guys behind the experts line every now

400
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,709
and then they come with an upgrade to

401
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:47,989
their friend hey we have an upgrade what

402
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,209
do you know the upgrade actually is a

403
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:53,119
tool that has a hidden partition on the

404
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,730
USB stick and it just grabs all your

405
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,279
fingerprints put them on the stick for

406
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:00,769
them to take back home so it's like a

407
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:03,259
really beautiful way of collecting all

408
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:06,829
that data from the guys you know in the

409
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:09,139
field or in all these different passport

410
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:16,540
control installations so like I said

411
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,889
this is all a practice you know part of

412
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:19,819
the practice of intelligence

413
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:22,819
piggybacking but how has it become

414
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:25,609
relevant to the idea of you know cyber

415
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:29,660
operations cyber espionage we want to

416
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,269
actually delve into cases now where our

417
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:34,730
research has essentially been showing

418
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,609
the hand of somebody else who that

419
00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:39,859
somebody else is we don't know we don't

420
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:41,539
pretend to know we have our suspicions

421
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,639
sometimes it might be you know another

422
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,529
apt actor sometimes it might be some

423
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:46,999
mercenary group it might be other

424
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:49,339
researchers who knows but we can at

425
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:51,289
least say hey back in the day we didn't

426
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:53,209
know how to interpret this now within

427
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:54,889
this sort of general framework maybe

428
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,389
it'll start to kind of put things into a

429
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:59,779
little bit of perspective all right so

430
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:02,629
this is one case that we have seen in I

431
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:05,689
think was 2014 we were looking internet

432
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:07,429
traveller how many people familiar in

433
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:12,380
that traveler very kind of still around

434
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,199
the net traveler guys so we were lucky

435
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,539
to get our hands on a copy of one of

436
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:20,240
their mother ships from a partner in the

437
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,199
mothership which was a Windows machine

438
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,299
running Windows I think it was 2003

439
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:28,549
server or something oh it was older I

440
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:32,269
older than 2003 server it had all sorts

441
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:34,039
of stuff on it of course it had a lot of

442
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:37,370
let's say victim logs connections from

443
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,420
the operators VPN configure

444
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,060
and so on what was like surprising and

445
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,800
we didn't expect to find us well as a

446
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,950
svchost.exe with that hash at that size

447
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,400
which was actually a back door and it

448
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,140
wasn't let's say a regular back door

449
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,080
this was basically a copy of SVC host I

450
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,360
was patched by the attackers with a

451
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,240
piece of shellcode dropped somewhere in

452
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,210
the middle that would bind a pretty much

453
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,750
a shell on port 3 1 3 3 7 the most elite

454
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,720
because it's a Lydia and we haven't seen

455
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,460
to be honest we haven't seen this

456
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,220
after this incident so it's like a super

457
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,830
rare backdoor we haven't seen it after

458
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,710
after this incident and of course you

459
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,540
can wonder who might be back during the

460
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,520
command and control servers of net

461
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,280
traveler with something like this it can

462
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,170
be all sorts of people for all sorts of

463
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,870
reasons I think that my personal belief

464
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,360
here is that the main goal was to get

465
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,880
victim information and persistence on

466
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,260
their mothership to understand what

467
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,150
these guys are doing and whom they're

468
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,170
spying on and I think they've done it

469
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:47,400
you know pretty much effectively and if

470
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,440
you are familiar let's say with similar

471
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,900
cases with very much love to hear from

472
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,180
you have seen something like this in

473
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,690
your research here's another case how

474
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,610
many people remember the crouching yet

475
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,280
the energetic beer dragonfly thingy

476
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,840
which came back quite recently so these

477
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,060
guys were using a command and control

478
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,610
backend written in PHP that was dropped

479
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,740
on hacked servers all around the world

480
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,490
but especially in Russia Ukraine

481
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,310
Kazakhstan what was interesting they had

482
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,340
the let's say 3 main scripts on the

483
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,130
hacked servers there was a lock PHP was

484
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,130
a web shell I was a test log basically

485
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,160
was not a tool of any kind was a log of

486
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,770
all the victim interactions and there

487
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,630
was a source PHP which was a through

488
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,540
command and control script now what was

489
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,520
it like as we were looking into this

490
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,760
hack servers and CNCs and we are looking

491
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,520
let's say at the scripts one day we

492
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,360
noticed that one of the log P HP's have

493
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,010
less

494
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,980
magically changed and includes a very

495
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,540
small img src to a remote one pixel chip

496
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,960
file hosted on a Chinese server it's

497
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,150
like makes absolutely no sense for the

498
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,640
attackers to put a Jif file hosted on a

499
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,840
Chinese server in their

500
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,340
command-and-control scripts basically so

501
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,470
who who that was we don't know well we

502
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,920
have some the same suspicions but I

503
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,720
think the idea obviously we like the

504
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,340
fact that they put it to a Chinese IP

505
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,050
address because that was around the time

506
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,270
when everybody was blowing in China for

507
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,480
the Eclipse you know the end of the

508
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,330
world and everything so this was another

509
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,750
very interesting case when we saw that

510
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,670
there are people out there hacking into

511
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:41,090
apt groups cncs and putting all sorts of

512
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,310
things for attribution or just to get

513
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:46,640
all the victim information now getting

514
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,410
it to let's say a bit of a different

515
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,070
case scar craft and dark hotel or this

516
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,430
fooled us this is one of the best cases

517
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,650
because it shows that even let's say

518
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,110
researchers with experience and you know

519
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,820
I say that without modesty that we have

520
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,740
a lot of experience I'm not saying it's

521
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,450
a good experience just that I we have a

522
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,050
lot and these guys that start the scar

523
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,210
craft guys and the dark hotel guys they

524
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,220
were both running operations at the same

525
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,950
time and they were doing it through a

526
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,860
hacked website called scar craft net so

527
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,530
both of them had command control scripts

528
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,180
on this website so we thought it's the

529
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,420
same apt in reality it wasn't what

530
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,000
happened here in the first phase did our

531
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,340
hotel guys came there they put their

532
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,080
scripts they ran an operation and they

533
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,540
got out then the other guys asked our

534
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,090
craft guys who are usually a target for

535
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,610
the dark hotel guys they hack the server

536
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,230
server and they put their

537
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,730
command-and-control scripts in a

538
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,650
different folder and started targeting

539
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,700
users in South Korea so that was like

540
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,620
kind of a payback you know through the

541
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,770
same pipe so to say

542
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,770
so this fooled us but when to be honest

543
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,260
when we looked at the victims for the

544
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,750
both things we immediately notice for

545
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,530
the scar craft stuff most of

546
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,020
victims were located in Korea and for

547
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,300
the their hotel staff most of the

548
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,760
victims were located in China and both

549
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,500
of them had some victims in the u.s.

550
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,690
because US is always interesting let's

551
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:20,000
say especially these days right so

552
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,430
another example from something that we

553
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,450
published relatively recently and

554
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,040
actually one of my favorite operations

555
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,890
that we run into how many of you are

556
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,840
familiar with projects or on REM sex

557
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,340
Strider oh very few okay this is one of

558
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,720
the most interesting operations I think

559
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,580
we've ever run into I actually think

560
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,340
that to borrow a term from the vault

561
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,370
seven leak this is an example of

562
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:48,900
next-gen tradecraft peek peek marketing

563
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,420
on that one but what's interesting about

564
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,240
projects Iran is they they essentially

565
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,090
use an entirely bespoke toolkit they

566
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,220
change all of their IOC s for every

567
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,800
single victim so actually indicators to

568
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,450
compromise are essentially useless when

569
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,530
you're trying to share between one and

570
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,210
the other the RO rules are still quite

571
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,710
good if you you know if you craft them

572
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,840
properly but this is I think one of the

573
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,330
hardest attackers to defend against and

574
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,590
one of the most sophisticated and what

575
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,120
they do and I can actually I actually do

576
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,460
mean that sophisticated in the way that

577
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,540
they manage their operations

578
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,030
now beyond all of the nitty-gritty of

579
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,950
what projects or undoes there was a

580
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:26,970
really interesting sort of bit of

581
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,130
minutiae in that in in the in the

582
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,600
investigation of projects or and we

583
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,340
couldn't properly frame it at the time

584
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,160
so essentially one of their backup

585
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,530
exfiltration methods was to send mail

586
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,420
out so you know you've probably had an

587
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,370
SMTP server as part of you know whatever

588
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,990
network they were a part of if they

589
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,430
couldn't go through their normal

590
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,950
exfiltration methods they would use this

591
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,690
as a backup of just starting to mail out

592
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,160
some of the information that they needed

593
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,100
and they would mail it to a server and

594
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,850
Cheil it so these this company which is

595
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,470
a fairly big company was actually very

596
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,970
kind and you know allowed us to have

597
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,040
access to this command you know what we

598
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,650
presume to be either some kind of CNC or

599
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,990
some kind of you know basically just a

600
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:10,380
staging server for for exfiltration but

601
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,230
when we analyzed that there was nothing

602
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:17,940
in it like no back door no misconfigure

603
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,279
nothing to essentially manager reroute

604
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,899
any of the stuff that was being sent

605
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:24,000
there we acknowledge the possibility

606
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,879
that maybe we got there too late maybe

607
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:28,830
these guys are just amazing and they

608
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,600
just were able to wipe out all forensic

609
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,529
artifacts or whatever it was but I think

610
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:36,600
that we also need to acknowledge that

611
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,690
for an actor of that caliber

612
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,580
there is the suspicion that they may

613
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,529
have been able to lift out this traffic

614
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:45,809
on the wire and it wouldn't be the first

615
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:48,120
time that we've seen some similar

616
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,279
indication is in the case of traffic

617
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:52,019
that goes out with certain magic bytes

618
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:55,320
for packets and certain sequences it's

619
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,629
out there if I could tell you anything

620
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,429
about passive collection happening with

621
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:00,899
a hundred percent certainty this would

622
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,970
be a very different experience but for

623
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,259
now we're just gonna have to interpret

624
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:08,610
spoke signals now what are the troubling

625
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,870
implications this is kind of me

626
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,549
switching gears to one of the more

627
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:13,200
problematic parts of the paper and one

628
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,460
of the more problematic parts of what

629
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,019
our industry is currently involved in

630
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:17,970
but one of the problematic implications

631
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,549
is the idea of code reuse we've been

632
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:23,610
seeing a lot of semi attribution or at

633
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,730
least clustering of thread actors taking

634
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:31,259
place on the basis of code reuse or some

635
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:32,639
people are skeptical about it we've

636
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:33,840
definitely been putting a lot of work

637
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,159
into it and feel that some of those

638
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,500
leads are actually quite solid but it is

639
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,210
one of the ways that you essentially get

640
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,940
yourself into trouble to say well if we

641
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,009
normally identify this actor or cluster

642
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,870
cluster this actor on the basis of share

643
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,309
tools or the basis of some kind of

644
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:49,679
closed source toolkit then to start

645
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,539
seeing it leveraged either in fragments

646
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,309
or leveraged entirely in other places

647
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:54,809
with new infrastructure makes it very

648
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:57,870
hard to cluster so an example that isn't

649
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:00,210
quite so sophisticated and isn't quite

650
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,980
so problematic but really stumped us in

651
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,700
the beginning was that of dancing Salome

652
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,100
this was a thread actor primarily

653
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,250
focused in in Russia and you know doing

654
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,929
some interesting operations outside

655
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:17,220
towards Western Europe the idea here is

656
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,009
that they actually leverage the hacking

657
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:22,679
team toolkit and at first we said oh you

658
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,090
know maybe they're a customer of hacking

659
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,769
teams but as we started to look into

660
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:27,659
some of the malware what was interesting

661
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:29,510
is that it actually used

662
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,500
it had the default configuration for

663
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,560
their demo version so what the field

664
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,510
application engineers would come and you

665
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,820
know sort of demonstrate for people this

666
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,530
was the exact same config that was being

667
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,030
used in all of the samples of dancing

668
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,250
Salamis so from the looks of it they

669
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,470
were barely able to scrape by

670
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,570
recompiling the stuff that got dropped

671
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,580
with the Phineas Fisher hacking team

672
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,280
dump and then proceeded to sort of real

673
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,620
leverage this toolkit in a way that was

674
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,780
at first fairly confusing and then sort

675
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,340
of kind of clustered itself into a whole

676
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,320
new group so this is just my way of kind

677
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,240
of starting to breach the subject of

678
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,710
code reuse it this is a far more

679
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,510
complicated topic and a paper all in

680
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,490
itself but it is one that has

681
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,810
interesting implications when you're

682
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,580
discussing fourth party and the

683
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,080
possibility of stealing other people's

684
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,480
source code do we have time for

685
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,480
unwritten goodies I don't know bonus we

686
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,000
have five minutes bonus or no bonus okay

687
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,680
all right well things that we're not

688
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,130
gonna put on paper now for sure stories

689
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,420
that you're just gonna have to you know

690
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:43,670
swallow whole from us and then first

691
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:47,930
story there is a rumor how many of you

692
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:51,980
remember wild Newton well Newton Morpho

693
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,120
butterfly morph oh that was a very

694
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,330
strange hacking group nobody pretty much

695
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,880
knows who they are because let's say

696
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,120
they're very good at it but back in 2014

697
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,240
they leveraged a zero-day to hack into

698
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,610
pretty much every big IT company in the

699
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:13,190
u.s. Microsoft was the victim Apple was

700
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,110
a victim Facebook was a victim Twitter

701
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,090
as a victim as well as 35 other

702
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:21,080
companies and basically let's say that a

703
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,050
very powerful agency got interesting to

704
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,270
these guys so they said okay these guys

705
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,970
are good let's find who they are so they

706
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:31,100
found one of the scene seeds of wild

707
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,470
Newton and they saw that there were

708
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,930
connections the operators were

709
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,430
connecting to this command and control

710
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:40,370
server of wild Newton from China which

711
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,860
normally what what what you say when you

712
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,210
see that

713
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,370
obviously has to be a Chinese apt right

714
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,320
so what they did they leveraged their

715
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,809
magic and they hacked those guys in

716
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:52,419
China behind that IP address to see

717
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:54,100
exactly who they are and what do you

718
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,950
know they were apt developers they were

719
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:00,399
Chinese apt developers who were also

720
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,980
infected with while Neutron and used as

721
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,740
a proxy by the true wild Newton

722
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,480
attackers to manage the command and

723
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,570
control server so this is one of the say

724
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:13,090
the most funny examples of how deep

725
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,700
these kind of false flag games can go

726
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,200
maybe the other one what about the other

727
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,390
one alright so let's talk about cases of

728
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,059
apts for good and let's say we did

729
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:30,190
mention the idea of apts leveraging a vs

730
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,570
and doing sort of interesting work on

731
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,580
victim boxes mostly for selfish purposes

732
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,929
but sometimes they can be a little

733
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:37,090
altruistic right so you might have a

734
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,039
prominent religious figure the kind of

735
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,440
figure that you know comes along once in

736
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,760
several lifetimes and there's you know

737
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,010
an object of much contention and this

738
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,020
this religious figure might be of high

739
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,309
interest to people that don't

740
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:53,470
necessarily mean this person a whole lot

741
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,679
of good and who are very proficient with

742
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:00,549
the cybers and all of a sudden a much

743
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,529
more powerful much more interesting

744
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:04,799
threat actor appears on these machines

745
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,130
sits there doesn't collect anything and

746
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,020
instead continues to see this attackers

747
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,580
malware come in and wipes it out so

748
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,289
where some of us may not have been doing

749
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:19,600
the AV job there it seems that other

750
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,510
powerful actors will step in and collect

751
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:25,919
and do interesting things for great good

752
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,820
alright so what does it all mean in the

753
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,200
end I think we kind of gonna rush

754
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,490
through a bit of a conclusions because

755
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,350
we're practically out of time and maybe

756
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,570
we can sneak a question in there but I

757
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,039
really do hope that you'll get a chance

758
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:39,610
to look at the paper that's the one

759
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,080
conclusion that I hope everybody gets to

760
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,549
walk away with this

761
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,429
take me back sorry is is essentially

762
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:47,529
we're not at threat until solipsism and

763
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:49,360
this is important because I know I also

764
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,250
know specifically the person on Twitter

765
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,659
that's gonna start saying that this is

766
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:54,549
an evidence that we can't know anything

767
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:55,570
in thread and tell us to

768
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,340
and that tribution it can't happen in

769
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,200
blah blah blah this is exactly the

770
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,610
opposite the idea is we want to move

771
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,230
away from the notion that we're just

772
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:05,380
doing this artistic thing to start to

773
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,420
delineate the limits of what we know and

774
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,160
the certainty with which we can know

775
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,140
things so that we go from from a bit of

776
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,410
art to a bit of science so the idea is

777
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:19,090
to know things with certainty it's also

778
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,710
important to realize that this doesn't

779
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,240
mean that everybody is doing fourth

780
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,380
party collection and signals

781
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,760
intelligence is everywhere and being

782
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,010
misused and abused and so on that is not

783
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,240
the case at all

784
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,710
they're probably a whole bunch of

785
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,240
lawyers involved when half of these

786
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,430
decisions take place and we haven't been

787
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,190
seeing things that would suggest the

788
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,200
kind of attribution cyber acrobatics

789
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,570
that people would expect to see so know

790
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,970
a PT's backdooring other a PT's tools

791
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,510
yet no full-on splicing of closed source

792
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,070
source code which is I think something

793
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,690
interesting when people talk about code

794
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,360
repurposing we're not exactly seeing

795
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,820
that the notion of infrastructure

796
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,190
takeover whether it is you know for

797
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,810
exploitation whether it is to shut down

798
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,330
somebody else's operation or just to

799
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,890
Doc's the people that were running that

800
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,650
up for you know accurately or

801
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,200
inaccurately or whatever now there's

802
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,420
also the idea that maybe these examples

803
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,920
have been so good but they have eluded

804
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,940
us entirely possible but I don't think

805
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,260
that's necessarily the case I just think

806
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,850
that there still there's restraint

807
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,410
involved in this and a lot for us to

808
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:23,800
still understand and like I said the

809
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,220
topic is complex as always a huge thank

810
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,380
you to Helen and the folks at BB who

811
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,540
have the patience to edit my papers that

812
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,550
always come like a month late and like

813
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,280
are like way past the word limit but for

814
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,330
those of you that are interested we've

815
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,010
tried to cover as much as possible we

816
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,200
certainly didn't exhaust a topic and I

817
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,610
hope that this is a conversation about

818
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,410
some of the more complicated things that

819
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,610
happen in intelligence that have now

820
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,740
infected our own realm of malware

821
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,420
analysis and are making our lives a

822
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,790
little more interesting

823
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:54,820
on that note more parties and even more

824
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,710
collection folks and I don't know if we

825
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,120
have time for at least a question or

826
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,979
something or one
