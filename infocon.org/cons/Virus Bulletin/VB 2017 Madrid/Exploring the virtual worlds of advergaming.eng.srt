1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,920
1 billion hours a month playing mobile

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,230
games more than half of mobile gamers

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,690
are women so there's a huge demographic

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,370
there that you can target these ads and

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,440
games a 91 billion worldwide profit in

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,500
2016 and that comprises 41 billion for

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,080
mobile 26 billion for retail so you know

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,060
in the shop whatever and paradoxically

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,480
19 billion for free-to-play because

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,800
obviously they make a lot of money from

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,789
downloadable content add-ins pay2win

12
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:32,250
things like that and you know think that

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,050
the survey in 2016

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,300
there's no stance for gaming in 2017

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,300
years they asked 2,000 gamers and

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,969
developers how they felt about adverts

17
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,610
in their games and 78% of gamers said

18
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,340
they'd be quite happy with ads instead

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,840
of paying for titles so that's why a lot

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,520
of games on the place thorne elsewhere

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,610
are typically free 62 percent said they

22
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,110
were quite happy to interact with an

23
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,899
advert for a reward that's actually

24
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,760
taken to its limit and a lot of mobile

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,739
games now and actually some PC games

26
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,629
where you're playing the game you die

27
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,760
and a screen will come up and say you've

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,799
died do you want a view an ad to

29
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,630
continue playing and if you view the app

30
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,220
you put right back into the game and

31
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,930
whereas you can block some ads on

32
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,880
consoles and on PC you can't really

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,470
block of those adverts because if you do

34
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,000
you break the functionality of the game

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,909
and in terms of retention 62% of

36
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,950
developers found that the retention

37
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,049
rates increase or stayed level after

38
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,229
they introduced adverts into their games

39
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:29,700
there's no real significant drop in

40
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,759
player numbers now this horrible mess is

41
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,650
all of technology all of the junk that

42
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,939
you've got lying around in your house

43
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,390
and the idea with all of these things is

44
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,200
convergence that's the name of the game

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,880
where you you throw away all the bits

46
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,320
and pieces of tech that you don't want

47
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,270
and what you're left with is the thing

48
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,250
that you know gives you a limited access

49
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,299
to all the things that you could

50
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,119
possibly want sort of because what

51
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,740
actually happens is you remove all of

52
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,210
this stuff you jam it all into the one

53
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,369
piece of technology and you end up with

54
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:57,930
this piece of technology effectively

55
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,290
becoming a content gateway so whereas

56
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,549
the technology is trying to drag

57
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,280
everything inwards paradoxically you

58
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,689
have this thing called the transmedia

59
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:09,000
narrative where all of the games that

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,560
you play the films that you watch are

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,239
broken off across multiple pieces of

62
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:12,900
media

63
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,030
of course you you you know you go and

64
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,409
see a film it's not just the film

65
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:18,030
anymore you have to buy the game to see

66
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,010
how the story ends properly or you have

67
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,629
to buy the books or the comics or

68
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:23,190
there's a download the ball where the

69
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,810
episode you have to watch or you're

70
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,879
missing out on the full experience

71
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,650
unlike the other consumers that go buy

72
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,690
all of this stuff and make lots and lots

73
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,250
of money for the game developers or the

74
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,760
movie makers so you know console

75
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,739
developers always talk about the

76
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,510
connected user experience you know it's

77
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,000
all in one it's a closed loop nothing

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,010
gets in or out it's all very safe and

79
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,620
all the rest of it but the actual

80
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,450
experience is quite different you know

81
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,670
back then you'd load up your Nintendo or

82
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,290
your your Mega Drive you'd throw the

83
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,940
cartridge in and you'd start playing the

84
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,000
game now it's actually quite a bit

85
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,859
different you have these horrible splash

86
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:01,230
screens with awful whooshing noises and

87
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,209
there's a logo from the the console

88
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:05,040
manufacturer and you've got to work

89
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,299
he'll you know when this thing's gonna

90
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,640
stop making awful noises at you so you

91
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,519
can actually load up the game well there

92
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,810
they you know that isn't the whole thing

93
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,430
because then typically you have to do a

94
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,959
system update because all the consoles

95
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,669
are web connected now so maybe they have

96
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:20,639
to update the the system to allow you to

97
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,109
play the latest game was just released

98
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:24,060
or there's a security vulnerability and

99
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,040
most of these things never actually tell

100
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,139
you when the thing is going to finish

101
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:30,540
updating so you can play the game you

102
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,099
know even even you know if you've got

103
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,019
kids that play Xbox one games you know

104
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,910
they throw the disc in and they're

105
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,379
immediately horrified because they find

106
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,030
out that you have to transfer all of the

107
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,889
data from the disc onto the console

108
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:43,290
before you can even play the thing which

109
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,060
results in lots of very unhappy children

110
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,280
and then you get to the dashboard which

111
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,500
is which is effectively a sales market

112
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,489
you know it's supposed to be there for

113
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:53,160
ease of use and access to your games and

114
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,299
all the rest of it but really it's just

115
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,949
another way to sell you things so you've

116
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:58,680
got you know advertisements for sales

117
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,629
you've got DLC offers they might want

118
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:01,769
you to sign up to a social network

119
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,400
through their app store and then once

120
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,840
you've actually found the game and you

121
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,129
can start playing in the thing

122
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:09,540
brilliant yeah I'm gonna load the game

123
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,250
off except no because then because it's

124
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,959
all online now you've got to mess around

125
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,060
with these awful euler's on your TV

126
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,769
screen there's loads of text that's

127
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,660
normally very small it doesn't make any

128
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,160
sense to the person sitting in front of

129
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,620
it and there's always a really long ugly

130
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,660
terrible URL that you can't do anything

131
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,220
with because you're on a console at

132
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,750
least PC gamers when they skip through

133
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,030
all this stuff you know they have the

134
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,740
option to read this the console gamers

135
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,130
have no way to do anything with this

136
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,470
so you bypass the EULA and then you've

137
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,850
got you know splash screen while the

138
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,110
game's loading up telling you to buy

139
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,850
more stuff only gets at the title screen

140
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,830
them as the offer of the week and then

141
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,389
you play the game and they're offering

142
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:47,370
you more things to buy that's just a

143
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,729
nightmare so in actual fact you know

144
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:53,820
going back to this this this RPG game

145
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,199
map that's going to become horribly

146
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,940
sober that this time goes on now you've

147
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,620
got the console and you've got the

148
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,940
dashboard certain in the middle as a

149
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,740
source of content gateway on your

150
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,620
content gateway fantastic and typically

151
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,000
you're gonna have to sign up to an email

152
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,520
login to access the console and sign in

153
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,850
on your your username so there'll be a

154
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,620
billing history associated with it

155
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,030
there'll be your name and address and

156
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,570
typically the email may be maybe given

157
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,370
to you IV the company that manufactures

158
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,979
the console so now you've got keyword

159
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,720
scanning on your email which could lead

160
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,870
to targeted adverts fire the ad networks

161
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:31,200
and now you've got apps on the dashboard

162
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,000
so they want you to sign up to some apps

163
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,590
but of course they're gonna tie into the

164
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,450
email login so now the app has

165
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,570
potentially access to that information

166
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,770
and of course it's going to be a EULA

167
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,970
because it's all online there'll be a

168
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,950
Terms of Service and more than likely

169
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,300
with a lot of apps on your console

170
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,310
dashboard it's gonna fire over to some

171
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,930
more targeted adverts because of course

172
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,789
it is meanwhile you've got all those ads

173
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:53,460
and sales on your dashboard you know

174
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,199
urging you to buy things and that's

175
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,849
looping in for the target advanced the

176
00:05:56,849 --> 00:05:58,440
ad networks the potential keyword

177
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,360
scanning and everything else and then on

178
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,830
top of that if you play games for any

179
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,300
length of time you're going to have to

180
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,380
probably set up some third-party

181
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,539
accounts because if you if you buy a

182
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,789
game on Steam save from Ubisoft you're

183
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:10,320
probably going to have to then set off a

184
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,190
Uplay account which is another sort of

185
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,990
games platform the functions as a sort

186
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,199
of additional layer of DRM so you've got

187
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,389
a load of steam and then you play and

188
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:22,889
then you finally get the game but of

189
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:25,530
course the game that your sign off who

190
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,970
probably has its own dealer Terms of

191
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,310
Service or the game clients as well so

192
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,530
you're going to get more ads and then on

193
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,820
top of that a lot of these third-party

194
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,830
accounts you're going to have to settle

195
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,150
an additional name

196
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,390
s billing cycle so for example if you

197
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:43,050
buy le dangerous on Steam before you can

198
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,880
buy any of the additional DLC content

199
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,920
all the rest of it you have to sign up a

200
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,590
third-party account for no website so

201
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,450
ultimately you know you're ending up

202
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,980
with all is this information all of this

203
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,240
data being spread across multiple

204
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,920
websites people are probably going to

205
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,500
reuse some of their login details all to

206
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,980
play a game and in terms of the actual

207
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,740
adverts in the games they're basically

208
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,320
all about static and dynamic ads so this

209
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,450
wonderful horrible representation of an

210
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,370
old console game from back in the day is

211
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,320
typically what you would end up with and

212
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,390
when they ship these games you know

213
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,920
that's it you can't bring them back in

214
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,810
there's no web connection or anything

215
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,790
else to fix something that goes wrong so

216
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,890
they drop in a wonderfully untargeted

217
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,590
static ad which usually had no relevance

218
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,670
to the person playing the game

219
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,240
whatsoever then dynamic advertising came

220
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,650
in with the rise of net connected

221
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,150
consoles such as Dreamcast and

222
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,370
PlayStation and the generations after

223
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,620
that so instead of the you know the the

224
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,900
closed shop on a car game you know they

225
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,280
might they might advertise some sort of

226
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,650
classic car although if they could

227
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,120
update it and change it again for some

228
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,620
sort of sports car if that was what you

229
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,820
were into and then they started to

230
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,770
introduce geolocation aisle advertising

231
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,330
so maybe in your immediate vicinity

232
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,040
there was a car dealership that was

233
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,900
going to open so you know they throw one

234
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,310
of those in and so you know go along you

235
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,530
might get a discount for it and then on

236
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,760
top of that we come to the actual

237
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,780
targeted advertising proper so in 2008

238
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,060
Barack Obama became the first politician

239
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,090
to run a campaign where they would

240
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,700
insert targeted ads aimed at gamers to

241
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,840
get them to go and you know to go and

242
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,220
vote so if you were playing I think it

243
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,650
was burnout 3 you'd be driving along and

244
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,080
you'd look and you see there's really

245
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,790
cleverly placed billboard that you

246
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,550
couldn't miss with Barack Obama's vote

247
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,770
for change Flyers all over the place

248
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,140
encouraging you to go and vote so you

249
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,299
know now you've got a situation where

250
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,909
the adverts are jamming themselves into

251
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,500
your game but that's not enough because

252
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,240
the you know and unless the game

253
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,789
developers know you know where you're

254
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,110
coming from where you're going to what

255
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,000
kind of ad it is they're going to waste

256
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,590
money on these adverts so the way that

257
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,030
they track the gamers are through

258
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,080
achievements

259
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,050
keep mapping and adverb placement so I'm

260
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,640
sure a lot of you play games and you

261
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,170
know you collect your achievements mine

262
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,490
a little bit let's hop they're not very

263
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,830
good but never mind and achievements

264
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,210
that are inherent goals of the game and

265
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,830
goals outside the regular game

266
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,110
parameters so you know pick up 50

267
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,880
objects kill kill a boss with your eyes

268
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,450
closed or flight there but they're not

269
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,410
actually that much of an accomplishment

270
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,630
because game developers now try to make

271
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,280
the games as accessible as possible

272
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,930
the designs make you feel like you know

273
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,970
real badass and carry on playing the

274
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,310
game but actually there's kind of police

275
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,650
and leaders behind the scenes so the

276
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,510
most recent dune game the last sliver of

277
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,460
Health you've got before you die has

278
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,560
more hit points than the rest of the

279
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,960
health bar normally to give you a chance

280
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,900
I think Far Cry 4 has a thing where if

281
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,070
you're surrounded by lots of bad guys

282
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,950
their aim becomes very very poor so you

283
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,300
think you know you're - annoyed from the

284
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,590
bad guys and killing everybody but

285
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,200
you're really not stealth games will

286
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,940
program the bad guys to not turn around

287
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,590
if you're creeping up behind them to

288
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,710
give them the old neck snap and so on so

289
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,270
these these achievements are there as a

290
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,940
really good way for game developers it's

291
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,110
not the primary reason they have them

292
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,980
but they're really good for game

293
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,810
developers to work out at a glance how

294
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,940
far into the game the game is a getting

295
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,790
because Steam did a global stats project

296
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,590
in 2014 again they haven't done one

297
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,680
since only 77 percent of people that buy

298
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,550
games play them on Steam only 42 percent

299
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,160
reach roughly halfway through the game

300
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,420
which is incredible when you think about

301
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,200
it

302
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,630
and only 29 percent actually finished

303
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,860
the thing and these aren't like you know

304
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,330
throw away games that nobody knows these

305
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,580
are triple-a titles like you know Mass

306
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,620
Effect or The Walking Dead and if you

307
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,910
think this is the kind of completion

308
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,200
rate for those triple-a titles you can

309
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,330
imagine how low the figures are for

310
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,710
these you know these shovel worth

311
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,360
free-to-play games on mobile and

312
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,220
everything else so that's why if you

313
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,230
play a game it's really interesting and

314
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,910
exciting for the first hour or so and

315
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,470
then it just falls off a cliff because

316
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,760
they know nobody's going to actually

317
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,400
reach past the halfway point so they'll

318
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,260
use that to make sure that the ads are

319
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,850
all sorts of front-load that rather than

320
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,570
at the back of the game so you know and

321
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,610
then you know 22% on top of all of that

322
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,310
22% are actually backlogged so they

323
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,200
don't actually they buy these things and

324
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,279
they never actually play

325
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,980
it's madness and this is you know this

326
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,810
is a mock-up of a heat maps of the game

327
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,639
developers can know what you're doing in

328
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,259
a game when you're doing it where the

329
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:08,939
hot spots are where the cold spots are

330
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:10,529
so they will take a section like that in

331
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:11,699
the middle though loads of gamers are

332
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:13,110
running down there what can we do this

333
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,069
open wide space

334
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:16,319
well they'll narrow it out and follow

335
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:17,790
you down a corridor and stick a bunch of

336
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,709
ads on either side of the screen so make

337
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:22,259
sure that you see these adverts so let's

338
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:24,360
see if this video works Alan Alan Wake

339
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,220
this is an Alan Wake this was a mock-up

340
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,139
I put together have a thing years and

341
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:29,550
years ago where you know you have to run

342
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,740
across a a moonlit landscape or four

343
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,730
Hill and there was this billboard

344
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,589
holding up at the top that you you

345
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:36,990
basically couldn't escape from from

346
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,459
seeing so you know they'll make you room

347
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,259
towards billboards and adverts but then

348
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:42,059
they'll also position something behind

349
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:43,649
you so you have to turn back around to

350
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:45,089
pick up a really important item like

351
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:46,800
this gone and then of course you look up

352
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,180
and there's a billboard ads on the back

353
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,860
of the you know the billboard as well

354
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,059
and these are things that you've

355
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:52,649
probably run into on a daily basis when

356
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:54,089
playing games but you don't actually

357
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,850
notice a another game home front hether

358
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,350
section where you used to run through

359
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,629
really narrow corridors the only cover

360
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:02,430
you had to keep yourself safe from the

361
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,870
bad guys was vending machines whether

362
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,420
thing energy drink logos on them so this

363
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,620
was another mock-up of them you can see

364
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,670
a similar sort of thing

365
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,529
and at the end of the level was

366
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:11,879
something similar to this where you have

367
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,769
to basically crouch up and down behind a

368
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:14,910
vending machine it was the only piece of

369
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,680
cover in the room and if you didn't you

370
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,970
lost them have to start all over again

371
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,740
so if you think about it you're booking

372
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,660
down behind this advert on the side of

373
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,809
this vending machine 20 30 40 times and

374
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:26,279
depending on the difficulty level and

375
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,470
account for retries you're getting a

376
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,000
face full of energy drink or boob or

377
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,120
Cola or whatever you know possibly 60 70

378
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,610
80 times which is insane and I guarantee

379
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,800
you've probably done stuff like this in

380
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,079
games and not actually noticed how

381
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,959
pervasive these adverts are so now it's

382
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,309
not just the ad networks jamming

383
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:45,600
themselves into the games willy nilly

384
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,179
you've now got the games jamming these

385
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:49,589
adverts influence of your eyeballs

386
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:50,699
whether you want them to or laugh

387
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:52,679
through through remapping the way they

388
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,230
design the levels working out the best

389
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,790
place for games to go when they see

390
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,050
these adverts and so on and so forth and

391
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,499
in terms of euler's for mobile and time

392
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:06,660
gates these are very popular things so

393
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,899
EA for the Mass Effect Andromeda mobile

394
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,689
game if you play the game you get

395
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:13,350
resources for mine

396
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,090
rocks and things in space but the amount

397
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,710
of rocks you get a very low so if you

398
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,180
download their app which is literally

399
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,940
just a series of timers that tick down

400
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,120
you get more in-game resource and Tetris

401
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,490
is by EA and lets us you know millions

402
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,410
of downloads very popular ages three and

403
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,870
above contains ads in-app purchases and

404
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,030
I sort of wondered all we hey there big

405
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,250
I wonder what their privacy policies are

406
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,020
I wonder what you have to read and sit

407
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,130
down and go through to be able to say

408
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,750
yes I can actually play this game of

409
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,330
Tetris I read the law so I wouldn't have

410
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,010
a look and I kinda wish that happened to

411
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,230
be honest in 2012 you had to wade

412
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,500
through 53 separate companies privacy

413
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,870
policies and this is on mobile so you

414
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,070
can imagine you know bringing out one

415
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,070
Euler or privacy policy on a mobile is

416
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,680
it's not it's not an ideal situation and

417
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,540
some of these didn't exist some of them

418
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,510
were broken so I went back last year and

419
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,340
that this these as far as I'm aware of

420
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,570
these things haven't changed it's all

421
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,400
still the same stuff I wanted to see

422
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,750
what you have to read through now to be

423
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,150
able to play Tetris you can you can't

424
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,250
read it you can see there's there's

425
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,140
significantly more companies there and

426
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,820
you'll also notice there's a big gap on

427
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,830
the right because there's yet more

428
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,830
companies it's like 2/3 full Scrolls of

429
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,650
just companies they've sectioned it off

430
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,150
into four sections and now it's not just

431
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,390
a big splat of companies it's there's

432
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,460
mobile advertising mobile analytics

433
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,710
there's online advertising and online

434
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:38,910
analytics 212 you have to go through 212

435
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,190
privacy policies to be able to say yep I

436
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,500
can now play Tetris loaded off wonderful

437
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,170
and the main EULA for this that leads

438
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,490
you through all these privacy policies

439
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,230
doesn't really make it clear if you have

440
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,060
to read all of those four sections or

441
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,770
just the mobile stuff but for what it's

442
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,020
worth the mobile stuff is 75 strong

443
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,570
anyway this is a ridiculous amount of

444
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,670
text and loads of these things are

445
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,380
broken because nobody goes back and

446
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,630
checks anything so you know there's 122

447
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,090
online advertisers only 83 of those

448
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,220
actually work 30 so ever them were

449
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,500
effectively DOA so the website was gone

450
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,110
or a redirect that's a spam or you know

451
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,460
they went to some other page or the

452
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,680
company had changed mobile advertising

453
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,890
is got 61 only 14 of those work 23

454
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,150
non-applicable so there's no way to

455
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,330
opt-out and 23 dead on arrival and it's

456
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,640
you know similar pattern for

457
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,220
all of these four sections I had to read

458
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,230
and I did read four hundred and six

459
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,200
thousand six hundred and nineteen words

460
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,280
out of the two hundred and twelve

461
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,980
privacy policies to be able to play my

462
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,160
game of Tetris and 110 work thirty-six

463
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,840
were not applicable and sixty-six were

464
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,450
completely broken that's just just under

465
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,220
half of all of these links that they

466
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,510
want you to go and read to be able to

467
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,520
play this game completely flatlined and

468
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,890
to put this into perspective it's not

469
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,020
that far off George Martin's longest

470
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,150
game of Thrones book which is four

471
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,440
hundred and twenty four thousand words

472
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,150
and you know you're not far off the

473
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,380
entirety of the Lord of the Rings

474
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,470
trilogy quite frankly I mean this this

475
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,840
this is absolutely unbelievable I you

476
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,460
know and this is pieces if you want to

477
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,430
play Tetris or some other EA properties

478
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:17,150
on your mobile device so this took about

479
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,540
twelve twelve hours it was twelve hours

480
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,610
of hell I did attempted on a mobile and

481
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,200
I gave off after an hour because it was

482
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,890
ridiculous

483
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,000
so that twelve hours were spent

484
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,680
breathing through all these on a on a

485
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,140
desktop and that was also hell but never

486
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,630
mind and in terms of virtual and

487
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,190
augmented reality you know virtual

488
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,630
reality is where you throw the headset

489
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,270
on and everything's digital augmented

490
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,100
reality is where you know you're looking

491
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,020
through your phone or say something like

492
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,090
Google glass and you get these digital

493
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,190
things bolted over you know the reality

494
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,410
in front of you and this is now moving

495
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,680
into a big space for advertising but the

496
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,570
augmented reality apps you know people

497
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,770
haven't really thought about how these

498
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,930
things work in the real world very well

499
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,580
you know the way I'm sure you've all

500
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,230
heard the stories about Pokemon go users

501
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,550
falling down holes and ending up in

502
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,380
nuclear power stations looking for the

503
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,780
latest Pokemon they actually ended up

504
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,459
going to course I believe in the States

505
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,470
because national parks didn't want the

506
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,060
Pokemon go players trampling all over

507
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,069
the nice flowers so this is a bunch of

508
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,449
push alerts on a phone you know

509
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:16,250
emergency alert hurricane warning

510
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,510
hurricanes are coming and then at the

511
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,880
bottom you've got different Pokemon may

512
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,470
be appearing in parks around you it's a

513
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,300
great time to explore your local parks

514
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,280
no it isn't it really isn't 1939 we got

515
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,360
the view mess though this is a

516
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,880
stereoscopic 3d device you plunk a disc

517
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,740
in you look through it and you know it's

518
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,570
kind of a weird 3d experience how many

519
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,930
how many people have one of these Hey

520
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,480
quite a few this still exists it's

521
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,300
actually a VR device now so that's this

522
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,890
one's mine and you know you stick the

523
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,270
phone and you go on google play and

524
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,380
download some of the games and the games

525
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,780
aren't that good really the primarily

526
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,180
for kids the 300-400 megabyte downloads

527
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,820
but all of the content is locked you

528
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,220
know I I tried the Teenage Mutant Ninja

529
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,050
Turtles game and you're basically in a

530
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:03,590
sewer

531
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,480
with four green things and a big talking

532
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,780
rat and you know the game consists of

533
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,430
walking up to each of the characters and

534
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,140
they'll give you a line of dialogue and

535
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,790
then implore you to buy a mini game

536
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,440
you've got no idea what the mini game is

537
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,330
really or what it does or how long it is

538
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,910
or what content is in there and most of

539
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,100
these games that I try and test it out I

540
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,870
like that and you know the reviews are

541
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,340
great you know the low rating is due to

542
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,690
the fact I didn't see anyway this is a

543
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,800
demo this is a demo actual cost 1699

544
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,590
Australian dollars and too much to pay I

545
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,970
don't like this game because you can

546
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,740
only talk with details but you can't go

547
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,130
into dojo and my personal favorite waste

548
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,110
of time by the way I'm nine and why do

549
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,760
you want it expensive I thought this was

550
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,290
free poor kid and you know this this is

551
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,600
me with a silly helmet on this look this

552
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,370
is the HTC vive I'm looking very

553
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,910
cheerful VR and rush HTC have got this

554
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,430
amazing advertising network package that

555
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,260
the setting up now it's only available

556
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,300
to use I can't use it at the moment it's

557
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,340
only available to game developers in

558
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:10,190
China and elsewhere so these this this

559
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,170
network this ad network over the certain

560
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,790
top allows game developers to download

561
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,980
an SDK so they can build it into their

562
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,290
games you can you can place

563
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,580
two-dimensional adverts

564
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,290
three-dimensional adverts sort of

565
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,910
adverts for apps on the you know the

566
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,700
infamous dashboards they will show you

567
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,070
how to code there you sign up I knew the

568
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,990
answer injected into the games and you

569
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,520
make money from the views and everything

570
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,590
else and they've got you know really

571
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,410
well for sour packages for both the HTC

572
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:43,040
vive and the mobile so effectively this

573
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,720
is a really targeted way like those

574
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,890
games earlier on where you've got the

575
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,750
ads down the funnel if we go back to

576
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,530
there

577
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,330
with the jazz club out now this is you

578
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,799
know this is 360 degrees this is

579
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,450
in-your-face they can combine the

580
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,179
adverts with sound if they want but what

581
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:59,120
happens if you know a shady ad person

582
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,740
manages to get into one of these

583
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,990
networks and replace you know legitimate

584
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,880
ads with garbage you know it's not going

585
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,559
to be too far off before we've got these

586
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,500
these virtual reality games with with

587
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,750
you know fish links and fish ads popping

588
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,640
up for free coins and everything else a

589
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,309
lot of games will let you open all web

590
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:17,929
browsers in game some of them include

591
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:20,120
that as their functionality so this this

592
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,650
really isn't a stretch to imagine this

593
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,970
is going to happen it definitely will at

594
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,070
some point but what if they don't want

595
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,750
to make some money or steals on accounts

596
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,059
what if they just want to troll people

597
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:31,419
because they could just simply place in

598
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:33,500
something that could trigger an epilepsy

599
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,070
attack or something along those lines

600
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,840
and you know this this is a big concern

601
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,190
with VR because a lot of people don't

602
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,380
have epilepsy attacks and don't know

603
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,669
they're epileptic until actually I have

604
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:47,450
one so be very very easy for someone to

605
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,890
jump into one of these ad networks and

606
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,110
potentially do something like this

607
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,390
Adobe are buying into the virtual ad

608
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,000
space with with a particular interest in

609
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,700
adverts in the cinema so you know you go

610
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,289
to the cinema you're watching the the

611
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:02,390
film with this headset on or you know

612
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,549
home with a headset on and then I'm not

613
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:05,630
entirely sure where these are supposed

614
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,179
to be placed but you'll get all these

615
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:11,150
swooshes promos for food and hot dogs

616
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,590
and drinks and all the rest of it and

617
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,510
vouchers that you can take and go and

618
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,940
you know purchase either in stores or in

619
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,280
the cinema again I mean I don't know

620
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,299
where you would see these hopefully it

621
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:21,770
wouldn't be during the movie so it at

622
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,210
least the possibility that you'll have

623
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,429
cinema trailers and they all have ads

624
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:28,070
bolted onto ads which is wonderful and

625
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,600
even apples AR kit that allows

626
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,280
developers to make augmented reality

627
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,860
games so you've got like IKEA space

628
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,720
that's effectively gamifying all of

629
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,299
these real world tasks to make money so

630
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:40,100
you know you wave this thing around in

631
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,830
your house you position and spin with

632
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:45,320
with real accuracy these these

633
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,970
bookshelves and tables and chairs and

634
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,169
then a quick swipe and you've purchased

635
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:50,390
there and this this is feeding back into

636
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,890
some third-party developers who are

637
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,659
making apps where you go into a

638
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:55,460
furniture store you put the helmet on

639
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,710
and when an object glows red they know

640
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,360
that you've taken a particular interest

641
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,809
in an object piece of furniture and

642
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:03,840
go over and give you the sales pitch and

643
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,309
you know digital house of home

644
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:08,940
advertising appropriately doe

645
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,229
advertising is is all about where you

646
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,580
know you're going to a department store

647
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,559
you've got your phone they have a notice

648
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,909
on the wall saying you know they will

649
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:18,039
serve you targeted ads and the phone and

650
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,659
the the billboard will interact and show

651
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:21,759
you a time to that the next wave of this

652
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,440
is going to be augmented reality so the

653
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,969
same sort of thing but now you've got

654
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,039
people walking around shops like this

655
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:27,820
with a phone

656
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,259
they've got hold of a shopping trolley

657
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:30,999
and they're clicking on things to get

658
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:32,739
cheaper prices than the person next to

659
00:22:32,739 --> 00:22:35,109
them they're saving 25% by clicking on

660
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:36,549
the tin of beans they've got alerts all

661
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:38,649
over the place and this digital sounds

662
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,409
awful frankly and then of course they'll

663
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:42,489
be able to use that day through and

664
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:44,080
stack up against everybody else in the

665
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,789
store so they'll be able to predict when

666
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:47,019
there's going to be a boom rush on one

667
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:50,769
product or another you know this this

668
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,239
all sounds awful I'm sorry

669
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:54,759
so effectively you've now got your

670
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:56,619
console or your gaming device which is

671
00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:59,229
probably hooked up to your VR or AR

672
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:01,539
device there's probably a user account

673
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:02,799
for that if it's one of the more

674
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,349
expensive brands and you've now got them

675
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:07,089
tying in to the real world which shops

676
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:10,239
mobile and apps and advertisers and the

677
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:12,039
question is where all of this data is

678
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:14,349
actually going to loop back to it could

679
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:16,059
feed back to the console some of it

680
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:18,339
could tie back to your email address

681
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:20,859
some of it may go to third party via the

682
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,599
advertisers and I think these are all

683
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:24,039
important questions that we need to

684
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,359
start thinking about and looking at

685
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:27,099
because it's it's only gonna be a matter

686
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:28,599
of time before we start seeing these

687
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:30,219
problems we're already seeing issues now

688
00:23:30,219 --> 00:23:33,249
with augmented reality apps like you

689
00:23:33,249 --> 00:23:34,749
know go out go and collect some Pokemon

690
00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:37,509
in a hurricane and it's gonna get worse

691
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:38,679
everything from augmented reality

692
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:41,229
assistive cars and other devices are

693
00:23:41,229 --> 00:23:42,789
gonna give us real headaches if we don't

694
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:44,499
sort of sit down and have a think about

695
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:46,419
what we can do to combat some of these

696
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:49,659
problems so that basically is my talk

697
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:51,039
I'm quite happy to field any questions

698
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,869
in the five minutes we've got left or

699
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:54,249
just come and talk to me afterwards

700
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:56,469
otherwise there's my visit there's my

701
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:57,279
blinky blinky

702
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,450
game over screen yep
