1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,060
um this has become a bit of a tradition

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,450
in in recent years gifted for those who

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,290
don't know Peter soror better serve as

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,509
he was caught in his native and

5
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:17,460
Hungarian was a great security

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,460
researcher one of the leading antivirus

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,650
researchers wrote probably the standard

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,660
work on antivirus which still quite

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,390
relevant in which I recommend people to

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:27,960
read it

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,029
that's him here he sadly passed away in

12
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,350
2013 and to keep his memory alive we

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,170
decided to give an award every year in

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,020
his name to a great piece of technical

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,840
security research published in in a

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,020
12-month period between the 1st of July

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,340
and the 30th of June the next year this

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,449
is the fourth year that we're doing that

19
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,629
last year the own attack linesman from

20
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:57,420
Fox 81 from a paper he wrote on a target

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,739
attack in in Asia we can click up many

22
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,870
many nominations this year thanks for

23
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,369
those who think thanks to those who

24
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,979
submitted something we got a shortlist

25
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,670
of three but I want to give special

26
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,020
mention of of two papers the first is

27
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,700
the first honorable mention goes to a

28
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,580
paper called distributed vulnerability

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,939
assessment or actually it it's a long

30
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,009
piece of it's a combination of various

31
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,630
research papers and presentations by

32
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,439
people from secluded who outsider who

33
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,570
had a sponsor booth outside this room

34
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,799
and university of do now Fieros or

35
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,210
something along those lines in in

36
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,939
Hungary and and I mention it because

37
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,500
it's it's a great piece of research and

38
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,659
also do a a mistake on on my behalf it

39
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,460
wasn't it was submitted too late

40
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,500
so apologize to a Ferengi and then it's

41
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,970
true

42
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,680
and a second honorable mention is for a

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,430
paper on the on the bay Rock botnet

44
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,640
takedown and which is a very long

45
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,409
project but these people from Symantec

46
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:06,840
together with with the FBI and actually

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,038
a lemur merge who's going to talk about

48
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,008
this tomorrow afternoon and it's one of

49
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,830
these good news stories

50
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,950
that sometimes we in the fight against

51
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,780
against bad stuff on internet in general

52
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,270
and cybercrime in particular we're doing

53
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,810
quite well so you got three shortlist of

54
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,090
three I set mentioned then Liam emerge

55
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,090
you who was a good friend of of Peter

56
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,360
and and who's actually presented

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,940
tomorrow I already mentioned he will do

58
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,530
the Oscar thing and an opening envelope

59
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:44,550
and read out the winner so the first the

60
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,410
first nomination is the is the

61
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,990
well-known sha1 coalition paper now as

62
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,330
research papers go this one was very

63
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,790
unsurprising because it was a public

64
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,830
secret that even this group was working

65
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,770
on this piece of research at the same

66
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,200
time or or why it was actually nominated

67
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,570
is firstly because it's still an aborted

68
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,580
piece of research but also it was really

69
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,709
great paper and they did some really

70
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:09,750
clever stuff beyond the brute-forcing I

71
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,250
think if you if you actually seen the

72
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,260
details of you care about this stuff

73
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,170
this matters and it matters in industry

74
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,300
where where some people are still using

75
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,510
an md5 hashes and it's a personal pet

76
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,970
peeve of mine so maybe we stop doing

77
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,890
that the second the second nomination is

78
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,660
for a a que builder this is a

79
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,450
crowdsourced exploited by a carpet is

80
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,700
upon us or SRP for friends former home

81
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,600
sofas in Hungary when we think of

82
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,610
exploit kids we usually think of web

83
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,280
based exploit gates this is a builder

84
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,830
for malicious Word documents and not the

85
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,060
kind of Word documents where you have to

86
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,430
enable a macro but another kind that's

87
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,290
that's given a lot less attention but

88
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,480
it's used by quite a few criminal groups

89
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,540
and other kind of malicious actors and

90
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,680
Tapan has written quite a few papers and

91
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,750
on the subject it's been presenting

92
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,940
about this tomorrow and it shows an

93
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,500
important an important piece in the

94
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,630
chain of cybercrime and if it highlights

95
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,010
the highlight of cybercrime works but

96
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,160
also it it really describes how well

97
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,410
these the export kids work and how they

98
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,330
make the life of a malicious actor are

99
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,690
quite easy and thirdly there's a

100
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,760
research project called Iran threats by

101
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,800
Colin Anderson and Claudia Guarnieri

102
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,590
Claudia you may have seen speaking here

103
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,970
yesterday it's I think most of us are I

104
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,680
mean it's a very global audience here

105
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,840
but most of us are from what we call

106
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,290
Western countries and most of us focus

107
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,560
on threats facing that threaten people

108
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,820
in the Western countries face I think we

109
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,770
sometimes forget even though we're aware

110
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,310
of it that for members of civil society

111
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,190
in Iran there are some serious digital

112
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,330
threats that they face that are

113
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,820
different than the ones that we face and

114
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,250
it's I think it's very important it's

115
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,860
something that these guys both do in the

116
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,280
free time and I think for that reason

117
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,550
alone the domination is is well deserved

118
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,880
and okay that's so that's a short list

119
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,910
so I'd like now I'd like to ask Liam to

120
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,900
do that to the Oscar thing

121
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,650
I did by the way link from the fire

122
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,780
splittin Twitter account a blog post

123
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,780
Liam wrote in memory of Peters or almost

124
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,430
four years ago and please do read it

125
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,650
because it's really touching and thank

126
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,599
you and actually I might just say a

127
00:05:56,599 --> 00:06:00,169
quick word about Peter and when I moved

128
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,810
to Los Angeles Matthew for 15 years now

129
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,310
and when I moved to Los Angeles about

130
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,740
ten years ago Peters or was somebody who

131
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,210
I really looked up to in the industry

132
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,360
and I had read his his book and I had

133
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,710
the great pleasure of actually working

134
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,780
on inside him in Los Angeles when I

135
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,000
moved there he was sitting at the

136
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,319
cubicle next to me and although he

137
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,419
wasn't my manager he wasn't in my direct

138
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:22,460
organization it was a great privilege

139
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,770
for me to be sitting beside somebody who

140
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,219
was who I respected so much and I always

141
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:31,759
remember when I moved there that I had a

142
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,800
difficult time settling in and I was a

143
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,240
lot of work to take on when I moved

144
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,830
there and he was the only person who

145
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,599
came up to me and he gave me

146
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:39,979
encouragement and told me that I was

147
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:42,080
doing a good job and just made me feel

148
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,860
like all the hard work was worth it and

149
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,729
that's something that always sticks out

150
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:48,409
to me so something I would like you to

151
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,900
take away today is to remember we've got

152
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,120
a lot of great people in the room here

153
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,860
we've got some legends of the industry

154
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,449
and we've got some junior people and

155
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,599
wherever you're at in your career there

156
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,279
are people who look up to you and it

157
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,740
only takes you a second to look at them

158
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,699
to look at the work that they're doing

159
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,589
and to give them encouragement and to

160
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:08,629
say you're doing a good job keep going

161
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,890
so spread the peace below

162
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:19,000
[Applause]

163
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,819
so now I have the opening envelope and

164
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:24,139
Martin said I should do the Oscar thing

165
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:25,789
and the Oscar thing this year was to

166
