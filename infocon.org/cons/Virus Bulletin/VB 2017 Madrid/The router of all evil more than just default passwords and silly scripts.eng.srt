1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,040
okay perfect if I can ask every to take

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,080
their seats and saddle will immediately

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,440
get going with Himanshu from Symantec

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,360
you're telling us about the router of

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,969
all evils yeah thank you everyone for

6
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,060
being here and thanks we be for giving

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,369
me another chance to be here last year I

8
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:21,960
was here I was talking about files

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,910
malware and this year I will be talking

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,750
about router malice so yeah so topic is

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,789
like sophisticated router malware more

12
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,410
than just default passwords in silly

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,329
scripts so as of yet we have seen a lot

14
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,469
of malware's router related mafias where

15
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,980
they were using the scripts and from

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,530
Mary onwards we all start seeing the

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,320
binaries but this in this talk I'm going

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,309
to discuss about we have seen an attack

19
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,219
where the attacker was actually flashing

20
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,680
the firmware of the router itself and

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,680
that was new for us and we feel like we

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,340
should share with the community and

23
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,690
Jason is not here she is having a baby

24
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,420
so Congress to her and it's just me here

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,430
alone ok and special thanks to these

26
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,770
guys so amalgam as yeah they have done a

27
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,900
lot of good research in the Linux space

28
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,210
and outer space so thanks a lot to them

29
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,830
thanks to Karthik and my whole team at

30
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,790
Symantec so a little about me I am I

31
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,829
sure I am working with the IPS Symantec

32
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,250
team and I got a few hobbies readers

33
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,759
just like us so first thing let's this

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,040
this top quiz divided into basically

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,259
three parts first part I am going to

36
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,530
explain a bit about router because might

37
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,030
be few people not really know

38
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,850
strategically importance of router in

39
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,590
the network and after that I will be

40
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,720
discussing about the maulvis we have

41
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,009
seen so far and the attacks which

42
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:57,540
important attacks which are related with

43
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,189
the outer and we have seen so far and

44
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:02,430
last third topic would be the core stuff

45
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,509
of this talk which is the forum where

46
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:08,818
what we have seen so introduction to the

47
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,000
router nothing really cool so just

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,120
Internet

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,760
router and it's just used to route the

50
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,330
traffic between the machines so I guess

51
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,099
most of you know so we should just move

52
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:21,519
ahead

53
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,489
so basically pack it in pack it out and

54
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:26,440
it just got few algorithms packet

55
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,930
switching algorithms and routing engines

56
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,940
so it decide which path to follow and

57
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,090
how to send the traffic from the

58
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,239
Internet to the and machine so

59
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:40,420
importance of router basically a router

60
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,060
is strategically located in a place

61
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,940
where from where if we can get access to

62
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,450
the router attacker can see all the

63
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,090
traffic coming in and going out in the

64
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,760
network so that's why outer is like very

65
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,909
much strategically significant you can

66
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:00,310
see all the traffic and you can control

67
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,590
all real traffic or almost all the

68
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,280
traffic so it can help the restriction

69
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,049
of host communications so if let's say

70
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:12,700
if an attacker wants you to not

71
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,470
communicate with something so those

72
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,569
things can be done and it can manipulate

73
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:21,239
a lot of things or almost every traffic

74
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,970
so how many of you guys remember this

75
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,419
okay what about this cool what about

76
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:39,790
this perfect so there's one thing common

77
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,329
in all last three slides anyone can

78
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:48,730
think about it okay so it's the router

79
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,959
so so oh ho three B's this talk is about

80
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,760
route as well obviously it's about the

81
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,010
router so so why attack routers so as I

82
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,160
said that strategically location of the

83
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,699
router is such that you can see all the

84
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:10,299
traffic so that's why a router and as of

85
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:13,000
yet what we have seen and people use to

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,280
attack right routers because it's all

87
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,849
about DDoS as a fact even if about Mary

88
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:21,969
or some of the other known malgus it's

89
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:24,690
mostly about the

90
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,670
ddos attacks the control they take

91
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,770
control of the traffic and they just use

92
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,290
it to reduce any particular website or

93
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,450
service or whatever so that's what they

94
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,170
used to do and these were the basic

95
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,590
thing but now we are sea-change in

96
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,140
threat landscape and we are seeing they

97
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,050
are doing hostage credentials they are

98
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,840
sniffing traffic and they are injecting

99
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,520
advertisement and very recently we have

100
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,890
came across there were few IOT Malgus

101
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,350
which were doing spam also the rate was

102
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,870
not very much I guess 10 spam per hour

103
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,330
or 10 spam 10 mil spam mail per day but

104
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,480
yeah that should be there but yeah this

105
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,970
is words like a bit sold so attacking

106
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,120
router so basically how attackers do

107
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,860
attack routers there were three basic

108
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,780
things default password DNS changing and

109
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,390
expert framework so anyway with exploit

110
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,610
frameworks what I mean is the frameworks

111
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,030
like Metasploit they got the known

112
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,970
exploits embedded in them so if anyone

113
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,330
can attack routers so let's go ahead

114
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,250
from here so default based word password

115
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,040
based attacks so this is the unless n PI

116
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,470
guy who was like selling the Mir a

117
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,130
botnet for the DDoS attack and the whole

118
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,280
botnet was based upon the default

119
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,780
password based attacks so all the

120
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,040
routers which are exposed to the

121
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,570
Internet and passwords are not been

122
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,250
changed and the passwords are still did

123
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,660
he fall so the guy was attacking those

124
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,419
routers and actually the IOT devices

125
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,460
basically so routers were also the part

126
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,320
of it and the guy was infecting them

127
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,650
with this bot and then attacking the it

128
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,780
so these are few of the default

129
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,060
passwords which are like which were

130
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,000
present in the bot at that time and I

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,100
guess he might have updated it or

132
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,160
something but yeah root admin admin root

133
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,470
and these kind of passwords I like even

134
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,360
in my home routers these were the

135
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,820
default passwords and I don't know even

136
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,460
before writing this doing this research

137
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,860
even my passwords are default I guess so

138
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,190
yeah we should change these passwords so

139
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,140
a DNS changer is this visible

140
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,210
I must say this this is a very bad image

141
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,830
but Dean is changing how this really

142
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,150
works is like someone to visit the

143
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,250
website and website is injected with the

144
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,290
iframes which make requests to the your

145
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,950
home routers and it's those requests in

146
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,740
a manner that it attacked the your home

147
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,600
router with the default passwords and it

148
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,990
changed the DNS server in the confi

149
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,900
configuration in your router page so

150
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,210
that's how the this DNS engine really

151
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,520
works and what they really do is once

152
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,100
they have attacked the router and they

153
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,100
have changed the DNS what they can do is

154
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,090
they can inject AG in the web pages so

155
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,470
that the all the machines in that

156
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,930
network who serve are right visiting

157
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,150
anything they would inject the ad

158
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,510
network and this is kind of common

159
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,150
attack I have seen a lot and if your DNS

160
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,310
password the router passwords I like

161
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,490
default or lose passwords then means

162
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,810
most of us have might have seen it so so

163
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,610
famous how to attack so the image is

164
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,580
previously I have shown so those were

165
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,830
all three were like major famous out

166
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,540
attacks so first thing is by hacking

167
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,820
team so the Phineas Fisher have

168
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:56,360
published this on I guess paste bin and

169
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,060
he this part way I have highlighted he

170
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,130
said that a zero-day am a bit embedded

171
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,289
device seems like easiest option so yeah

172
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:08,610
that means even attacker knows that

173
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,070
router and embedded devices security is

174
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,070
not that great so see nice fish I have

175
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,650
tried means when he thought about taking

176
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,560
the hacking hit him down he targeted the

177
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,010
zero day in the router device so that he

178
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,440
can penetrate or the first point from

179
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,120
where he can penetrate in their network

180
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,500
so yeah so this is like very famous

181
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,169
attack what we have came across after

182
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,030
that we have came across equation group

183
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,000
dumps so shadow brokers have done the

184
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,190
equation group and they have listed like

185
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,700
these many exploits which were related a

186
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,830
few of them were related with Cisco or I

187
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,150
guess all of them were related with

188
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,600
Cisco I don't know but yeah so even this

189
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,990
thing is clear up says a story that

190
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,780
people are really aware about router

191
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,960
exploits and they are using and in a

192
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,750
dump we are saying like Shadow Broker

193
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,460
kind of dump we are seeing such kind of

194
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,530
zero days so that means people are

195
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,890
really targeting routers and they are

196
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:16,760
away about the importance of router and

197
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,240
how they can really use router to target

198
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,710
people yeah so types of malware so

199
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,560
basically three types of malware

200
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,480
basically first ruined firmware was like

201
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,640
different case but yeah script is mobile

202
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,290
so majorly we have seen in script is

203
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,780
malware they a Python script or perl

204
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,850
script people are using and then they

205
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,730
are most of the time they were

206
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,920
connecting to some IRC channel and which

207
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,380
were used or which were used for doing

208
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,230
the DDoS so basically majorly same kind

209
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,960
of thing DDoS based attacks word scene

210
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,240
with script based malware after that we

211
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,730
came across the compiled binaries e.l.f

212
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,250
kind of malware's so e.l.f kind of my

213
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,830
lyricism polluting the mira example and

214
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,500
then we came across firmware so when we

215
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,330
talk about firmware Sam there could be

216
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,190
two cases one case what I'm going to

217
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,830
discuss is like attacker is flashing the

218
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,560
router firmware remotely and another

219
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,780
case is like vendor themself are

220
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,420
providing infected firmware and they are

221
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,250
shipping the router with the from the

222
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,750
infected firmware itself so I'm not

223
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,600
discussing that part so it script this

224
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,860
valve iam basically we have seen

225
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,620
shellshock series of exploits were using

226
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,440
and they were like exploited and they

227
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,880
had well

228
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,700
IRC BOTS embedded in them so in the URL

229
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,800
itself sometimes it came with a LF also

230
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,790
and it was like same as the means you

231
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,860
know that router base security is not

232
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,990
that good and the event of themselves

233
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,140
they are not really good with patching

234
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,089
this stuff and still in the field we can

235
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:51,790
find

236
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,160
like if I am if you go to market and buy

237
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,410
a new router we might find it still

238
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,530
vulnerable with 2014's these CVS I shop

239
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,740
CVS or any of the other very old Linux

240
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,280
series so as Linux is freely available

241
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,420
and they can modify it but still they

242
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,240
are not really eager to patch these

243
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,730
stuff so yeah still these things are

244
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,990
like very much can be found in the field

245
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,550
and common traits in these kind of

246
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,850
Malgus are like they drop a shell script

247
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,090
so this is the shell script where they

248
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,610
in here they were downloading the

249
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,730
binaries and they were replacing our the

250
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,800
binaries with the normal system binary

251
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,130
so different IP address and simply it

252
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,780
was just a look at and then downloading

253
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,150
the binaries and replacing it all the

254
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:50,560
binaries were like the the normal binary

255
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,450
which are like they were replacing the

256
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,850
system binaries with the same name and

257
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,060
same thing and that's all so compiled

258
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,740
binaries kind of attack we have seen

259
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,240
with melee and which was a base attack

260
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,720
so basically may when one device is

261
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,760
infected with Miri it was attacking

262
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,980
other devices and checking for devices

263
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,410
on the network and on the internet so

264
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,930
that it can find out where the default

265
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,150
passwords are and if any other default

266
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,310
password got hit then they would

267
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,070
reinfect them so basically one kind of

268
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,850
behavior so it was self-propagating so

269
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,570
firmware so this is the real real thing

270
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,180
of my talk so firmware basic acting a

271
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,000
gear router attack so in which we found

272
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,210
that Netgear @cv a remote code execution

273
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,720
cv the cv was found and what I talked I

274
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,050
was really doing he was using this cv

275
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,470
for the remote code execution and

276
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,540
attacker was flashing the firmware with

277
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,340
open source firmware and he was using

278
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,530
firmware mode KITT that's FM Kate's

279
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,870
extent it's an again open source tool

280
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,170
and I think I have modified that

281
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,110
found where to put in his scripts and

282
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,630
the I'tikaf was flashing the firmware

283
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,560
with it so this is the string exploit so

284
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,570
in here IP address we can simply replace

285
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,790
the IP address with the IP address of

286
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:20,500
the router and the the vulnerability was

287
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,019
in cgi-bin Park and in here we can see

288
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:25,510
the attacker is downloading is so it's

289
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,060
like HTTP IP address then H is slash the

290
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,209
blue iit ug e dot ASIS so that's the

291
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:34,570
shell script what attacker is

292
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,029
downloading and putting in it empty

293
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:40,110
slash something and then executing is so

294
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,089
very simple plain exploit where it was

295
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,300
getting the RC so what's inside the

296
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,459
shell script so inside this shell script

297
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:51,700
we can see the attacker is downloading 1

298
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,079
1 2 dot bin which was the form via from

299
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,200
this IP and that's all it was doing

300
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,269
right and then reboot so this this

301
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:03,070
simple shell script what it was using

302
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,940
for flashing the firmware itself so

303
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,399
going inside the binary what it have

304
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:13,360
dropped what we can see is like this is

305
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,279
bin box simple so bin wok we can see

306
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,339
it's say TRX firmware idea and it is

307
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:20,860
kind gzip compressed data so yeah this

308
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,300
is firmware this we can verify from here

309
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,510
and once we have done the bin work via

310
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,310
what we did is like we have extracted

311
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,800
the binary we did the bin walk - see

312
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,230
simple and after that we have walking

313
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,149
through the directory structure and when

314
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:39,399
we did the walk into the titleist we

315
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,850
found out that inside in e dot d it had

316
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,670
two very interesting files in there so

317
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,199
RCS and this dummy file so inside this

318
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:52,690
script when we get inside those script

319
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:57,820
what we find out that it was creating a

320
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:03,790
file with the date and it was uploading

321
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,180
that file to our FTP server so this

322
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,959
thing was interesting and this was the

323
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,019
whole command and you can see that you

324
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:15,970
and password so I haven't really changed

325
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,800
it so this many much same what we have

326
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,749
seen in the attack so the user ID and

327
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:22,899
password and the path where the attacker

328
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:25,389
was is really uploading all these things

329
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:28,119
and the 4matic was uploading was like

330
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:30,009
country's first full letter then date

331
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:31,869
and then IP address and then extend it

332
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:36,100
was uploading to its FTP server again so

333
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,309
what the attacker was uploading as of

334
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:40,869
yet we have never seen such kind of

335
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:43,389
attack where the attacker is really

336
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:46,749
trying to flash the firmware and it is

337
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:50,499
trying to upload this job because before

338
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:52,029
then we have most of the time what we

339
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:54,610
have seen was like it was doing the DDoS

340
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,889
attack mostly it's all about DDoS attack

341
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,319
or injecting ad but this thing this was

342
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:03,309
thing was new for me and this thing is

343
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:07,329
like when we try to go inside this so we

344
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:09,249
find out it was doing Dean sniff and

345
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:11,589
then this command and all the username

346
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:13,959
and passwords whatever it came across it

347
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:16,059
was dumping all those things in this

348
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:20,439
file DA's file dot txt and this was the

349
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,929
very first time where we found out that

350
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:24,999
with the firmware itself the attacker

351
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:28,720
was trying to sniff the credentials and

352
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,249
the attacker was harvesting the

353
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:35,290
credentials of the network and when we

354
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,110
really logged in into that router so

355
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,019
these many files we did found so it's

356
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:43,240
just just snippet but yeah they were

357
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,569
like it's just a and B so they were like

358
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:50,799
CDE and Dylan Z so yeah so these many

359
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:55,139
files we found so obviously these many

360
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,949
routers were infected by the attacker so

361
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:02,470
before going to the demo there was very

362
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,569
interesting thing in that the

363
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:07,240
interesting thing was there are few

364
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,099
files which are like bigger files and

365
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:11,439
when we go inside those files what we

366
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,069
found out that the routers which were

367
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:17,289
infected by this firmware were also

368
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:21,699
infected by Mira and as the attacker was

369
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:24,849
sniffing all the credentials and it

370
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:26,289
trying to harvest all the credentials so

371
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:30,220
we what we found out that we had all the

372
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,460
passwords which were tried by the made a

373
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,679
botnet over these routers the same thing

374
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,059
we can see in these text files also so

375
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:45,610
demo tank so here I go out to 1 1 2 dot

376
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,760
bins so I'm simply doing the bin walk

377
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:59,110
and we can see the firmware header so

378
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:07,150
this is squash FS file system so I'm

379
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,460
just extracting everything so here we

380
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,260
got underscore one went to bin dot

381
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:16,809
extracted so going inside squash FS file

382
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:18,669
system and we can see this is Linux

383
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:21,840
directory structure

384
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,730
so now I'm just going to list all these

385
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,509
in a tree format so tweet or text

386
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:45,740
exported going in there opening this up

387
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,289
busy box and all this stuff so any D we

388
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:52,139
had this these two files so we need

389
00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:53,549
these for whenever this system would

390
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,700
reboot it would real initialize all

391
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:04,110
these things now going inside the

392
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,710
scripts so yeah this is what it is doing

393
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,259
sleep with the sleep sometime and then

394
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:12,299
it is doing W Kate and doing downloading

395
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:15,749
the SH strip so and lo and we can see

396
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:19,169
the its hours from where it is trying to

397
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:21,980
download other files

398
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,620
hi Jesse

399
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,150
okay

400
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,750
so I want you to do a live demo but

401
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,190
unfortunately I haven't really bring up

402
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,590
my laptop that's like use so yeah so

403
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,470
best practices like keep your from from

404
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,010
there up to date but someone did ask me

405
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,290
do you update your firmware router and I

406
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,180
said no I never have done it but yeah

407
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,530
it's a better practice to do it because

408
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:13,700
because from where are like I like not

409
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,500
not that secure we know this thing and

410
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:21,890
even the big thing is our a the firmware

411
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,710
developers know that they are not really

412
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,050
going to update it because I found few

413
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,240
vulnerabilities with my home router and

414
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,110
when I did try to disclose it to the to

415
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,150
the vendor they simply didn't listen to

416
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,310
it so yeah that kind of things do happen

417
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,960
because they don't really care about

418
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,550
security what they care about only the

419
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,710
hardware and just you ship it and once

420
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,510
they have shipped it they don't really

421
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,220
care about what my nobility what

422
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,290
zero-day what I see or what kind of

423
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,660
privileges someone else is having so

424
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,820
yeah so that's an issue and most of

425
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,100
these kind of issues do happen with the

426
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,340
home routers so another thing is do not

427
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,990
use default passwords so default

428
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,670
password is like a very huge issue

429
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:05,660
because we have seen attacks like

430
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,720
mirroring and we cannot really ignore

431
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,610
default password thing and that's that's

432
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,620
really a big issue and use strong

433
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,180
passwords so how come this is different

434
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,430
from default password is like default

435
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,070
password is like admin admin or admin

436
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,570
password so a strong password would be

437
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,760
like at least someone might not able to

438
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,530
find it in the dictionary attack who

439
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,270
knows in future they might distract

440
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,460
using complete dictionary for brute

441
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:35,240
forcing indi passwords so yeah and QA so

442
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,920
yeah question sign
