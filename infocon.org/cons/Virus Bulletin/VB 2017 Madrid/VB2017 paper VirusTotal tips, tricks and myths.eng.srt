1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
body are made of aluminum your host for

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,940
the next two sessions and I see that you

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,470
all made it through the night

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,929
unbelievable I think you're more awake

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,259
than I am anyway we have two brilliant

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,390
presentations ahead of us and one of

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,000
them is a very interesting story about

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,050
virustotal

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,689
from Randy Abrams actually I know Randy

10
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,180
Abrams for how many how many years I I

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,150
don't know something like that yeah way

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,610
too long I think anyway from Microsoft

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,280
from ESET and from some other parties

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,270
anyway I would go and give the room to

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,520
him at this moment Randy go ahead good

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,800
morning and thank you for all showing up

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,960
first thing in the morning on Fridays

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,289
fatah so I'm going to talk to you a bit

19
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,210
about virustotal as you probably guessed

20
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,250
and I'm going to tell you everything you

21
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,020
need to know about virustotal

22
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,230
on one slide I know you think you

23
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,930
understand what you thought you I said

24
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,579
but I'm not sure you realize that what

25
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:03,809
you heard is what I meant

26
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,950
and for most people using virustotal

27
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,850
that describes it perfectly so just a

28
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,580
little bit about virustotal it was

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,229
started by his physec the spanish

30
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,780
company it was acquired by Google in

31
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,990
September 2012 which kind of caused a

32
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,590
ruckus in the security company security

33
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,290
world wondering what's going to happen

34
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,329
it's a cloud-based security resource a

35
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,850
lot of people call it virus total virus

36
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,159
scanning service it's a lot lot more

37
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,460
than that they provide third-party

38
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,750
analysis of files URLs domains hashes

39
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,040
but they also do some of their own

40
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,380
research and augment it with that and

41
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,490
they have a threat intelligence feed so

42
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,710
this is the interface most people are

43
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,350
familiar with Feroze Tom will you tell

44
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,700
it a file URL whatever and you submit it

45
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,619
but there are other ways to do it their

46
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,079
desktop there's a desktop application it

47
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,429
gives you context menu drag-and-drop you

48
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,919
can use email if you put scan in the

49
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,310
subject line it's going to return this

50
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,930
and results like you would expect if you

51
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,880
put scan plus XML you get XML email is

52
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,670
the lowest absolute lowest priority way

53
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,430
to submit something and for example in

54
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,290
researching the presentation two weeks

55
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,080
ago I submitted a file and it's not back

56
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,800
yet so I don't recommend email

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,170
virustotal has a public API I encourage

58
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,670
you to sign up for the virustotal

59
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,330
community you'll get a free api key

60
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,709
unless you don't know how to use an api

61
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:46,700
like me but if you do go look you know

62
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,860
you don't need me to talk about it I

63
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,440
don't show it but there is a private API

64
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,180
that a lot of researchers in the room

65
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,330
use and it returns a much richer data

66
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,150
set there's also an Android application

67
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,700
which I kind of find the little androids

68
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,500
they know it but evidently they don't

69
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,540
know Google yet it's all submit Google

70
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,650
for them so who doesn't love a bunny

71
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,709
rabbit a cute bunny rabbit really tell

72
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,660
if you don't love a cute bunny rabbit

73
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,340
you've never seen a good recipe for a

74
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,670
cute bunny rabbit okay

75
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,769
are all of you familiar with the killer

76
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:25,459
rabbit of Karen okay Wow route this is

77
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:27,950
referring to a Monty Python sketch that

78
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,799
little cute harmless bunny rabbit jump

79
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,660
up in the air and grab your throat and

80
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,850
kill you in fact it took a Holy Hand

81
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,750
Grenade to kill that little whatever so

82
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,540
I got an email one day and you know it

83
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,239
says this is a cute little bunny rabbit

84
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,730
and it's got the executable attachment

85
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,549
rabbit dot exe and tells me this is

86
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:52,430
really funny so of course I mean I'm

87
00:03:52,430 --> 00:04:01,609
gonna open it double click and that's

88
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,049
what would happen when you double click

89
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:05,389
on it and it's like huh I wonder what

90
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:08,329
else happened so I submitted to

91
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:11,209
virustotal and this is interesting

92
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,420
I have only found a couple descriptions

93
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,639
Roos SEL sobs there's a lot of variants

94
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,829
but the couple I have found are things

95
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,228
like bots and dental motors and

96
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:24,890
keystroke loggers and I mean this this

97
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,750
is pretty

98
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,350
common in this result is all see Trojan

99
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:35,240
LK win Trojan joke we got two languages

100
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,650
here Trojan and joke what general

101
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,470
variant there's all kinds of detections

102
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:51,110
here it's all over the place so what is

103
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,390
it you know we've got an Artemis Artemis

104
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,780
is mcafee cloud so you can't tell what

105
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,070
it is eight genetic generic versions of

106
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,110
Zeus II you know it's kind of bad stuff

107
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,400
one generic malware ten detection that

108
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,280
call it a joke somewhere in the name a

109
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,780
risk where nine Trojans actually the

110
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,150
rabbit wasn't one but it included a

111
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,260
Trojan joke to pups and twenty-eight

112
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,410
products did not detect this at all as

113
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,060
anything so I got a riddle here for you

114
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,450
if he is she then who is he and is a dog

115
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:38,240
of fish is a dog of fish yes no nobody's

116
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,900
answer what language are you speaking if

117
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,890
you're speaking Hebrew then he means she

118
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,630
it's a Hebrew word for what we say she

119
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:52,790
and who is he and then yes a dog is a

120
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,220
fish actually typically it's spelled D a

121
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:01,220
a G but it's pronounced so remember that

122
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,669
Trojan joke we're using two different

123
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:06,979
languages here so if I say I was out

124
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:08,990
walking my dog in the snow when I ran

125
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,020
into a friend of mine do I mean a dog or

126
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,760
was I out walking my fish in the snow he

127
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,130
was wearing a bikini am i talking about

128
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,100
I could I hope not this is bad or was I

129
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,600
saying she is wearing a bikini I always

130
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,150
knew he was strange am I talking about a

131
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,060
guy are a woman that appears to be from

132
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:37,580
a different species so is the bunny

133
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,370
funny

134
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,300
Artemis I can't tell I suspect that it's

135
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,580
a false positive but I really can't tell

136
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,590
you if that Artemis is saying it's a

137
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,240
joke or a pup or whatever

138
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,810
Zess II Elza almost certainly a false

139
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,880
positive except maybe some of the

140
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,910
variants are I don't know

141
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,990
generic malware that's a false positive

142
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,770
this is not generic malware joke yes

143
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,840
this is a joke email me if you'd like a

144
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,660
copy of rabbit dot exe it's a lot of fun

145
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,070
to send to people well you can't really

146
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,520
send it an email unless you get them to

147
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,820
unzip it risk we're okay in the

148
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,350
corporate environment imagine that

149
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,910
you're sitting in a call centre and

150
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,310
someone opens this up and ten cubes all

151
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,289
around here hey everybody I'm watching

152
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:25,690
porno and the real risk is still the

153
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,520
person that sent it there's no job

154
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,660
anymore trust me I don't have a job

155
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,070
trojan it's a false positive yeah you

156
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,370
can say any program can be a Trojan I'll

157
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,000
tell you what you detect formula

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,460
actually I think it's for mass comm on

159
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,930
the virus bulletin test false positive

160
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,470
this is not a Trojan pup potentially

161
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,260
unwanted who in here does not want

162
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,669
rabbit dot exe and finally no detection

163
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:00,190
and no detection is completely valid

164
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,169
there's nothing malicious about this

165
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:04,810
program there are no bad programs

166
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:09,820
there's bad people so I'm going to go

167
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,430
into some myths about virus total one of

168
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,680
them is that virus total can be used for

169
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,320
comparative testing and I'm not going to

170
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,180
address up all that virus total address

171
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,760
it they're tired of repeating it's not

172
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,530
used for comparative passing and they're

173
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,780
really really nice they say that if

174
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,849
you're doing that you've got implicit

175
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:29,800
errors in your methodology which is a

176
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,049
very polite way of saying you kind of

177
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:34,380
don't know what you're doing at all

178
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,110
another myth that virus total detection

179
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,779
of malware means that the antivirus

180
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:44,290
scanner can detect the malware well as

181
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,230
virustotal explains the versions they

182
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,089
use our command line and I can tell you

183
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:51,339
from testing that a command line version

184
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:53,260
does not necessarily behave

185
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,770
as the version with a GUI and they can

186
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,290
have different techniques having a

187
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,360
command-line does not use the full suite

188
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,610
and all the capabilities to provide

189
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,790
protection or detection you can have

190
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,370
desktop and Gateway solutions on the

191
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,740
same scan and you cannot compare those

192
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,600
for comparative testing that's apples

193
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,110
and oranges or apples and fish and dogs

194
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,230
and then the developers the researchers

195
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,300
can add their own command lines which

196
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,410
can dramatically increase or decrease

197
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:31,300
your heuristic capabilities more geek

198
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,540
mythology lack of detection means the

199
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,319
file is safe

200
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:46,250
you don't believe that do you I have to

201
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,200
explain that to anyone in the audience

202
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,779
please say no thank you

203
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:57,290
well oh I didn't there's some people

204
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,290
don't realize that because they can have

205
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,440
custom detections they can choose not to

206
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,779
detect a file they detect it but they

207
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,760
choose not to because they don't want to

208
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,740
tip their hands to the virus malware

209
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,420
authors that are using virustotal but

210
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,600
you start getting into context let's

211
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,660
assume that this file is completely and

212
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,160
totally clean in fact the one I

213
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,620
submitted is probably completely and

214
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,600
totally clean but that doesn't mean it's

215
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,180
safe if you look at this in the

216
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,660
additional file detail the certificate

217
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,269
was explicitly revoked by the publisher

218
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:39,649
now I was curious snooper is a weird

219
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:42,050
copyright usually it's incorporate or

220
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,149
something the research I did led me to

221
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:45,890
believe that there a valid publisher

222
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,290
they might have revoked the certificate

223
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,170
because it got stolen that's probable I

224
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,579
don't know you could revoke a

225
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:54,589
certificate because it's got such a bad

226
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:56,390
security risk you don't want people

227
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,540
installing it but a clean detection it

228
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,670
may be harmless you probably don't want

229
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,660
to run it another one they saw a

230
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,420
certificate out of validity

231
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,920
someone could have forgot to time stamp

232
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,270
it maybe the company went out of

233
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,950
business but this is important

234
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,880
contextual information file not found a

235
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,010
lot of people think this file came in

236
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,130
under suspicious circumstances it's not

237
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,190
found and extrapolate okay nobody

238
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,350
detects this brand new unknown piece of

239
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,449
malware no it just means virustotal

240
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:31,490
hasn't seen it in one in case that

241
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,040
happened so I went to ops wot to there

242
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,050
meta Defender and it turns out if

243
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,970
virustotal had that sample you would

244
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,470
have seen at least three different

245
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,230
products detecting it so it's always

246
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,269
good to get a second opinion or third or

247
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:46,360
fourth there's a lot of stuff out there

248
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,510
false positive means false positive and

249
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,930
that isn't exactly true like I said

250
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,920
visit the

251
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,290
senators can withhold they can add high

252
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,260
heuristics but this was really

253
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,680
interesting that several scanners

254
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,200
false-positive on hello world it was a

255
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,110
debug version and Jim Regan I'm Steve

256
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,360
Reagan it was awesome he asked the

257
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,820
vendors why it happened and the

258
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,480
responses were interesting

259
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,790
Iram said that the layers work in

260
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,279
conjunction and since they've only got

261
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,500
the command line that false-positive

262
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,510
could have been mitigated by additional

263
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,050
components doctors been krauser from

264
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,010
CrowdStrike

265
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,600
read the article he has some humorous

266
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,790
stuff in there too but works with

267
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,260
several other layers of defense ROG

268
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,410
don't no one you know that just uses

269
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,100
their dynamic machine learning engine or

270
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,290
a static one they've got dynamic you can

271
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,079
use multiple layers so that

272
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,920
false-positive Garneau from f-secure it

273
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,600
wouldn't have triggered on the customer

274
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,300
machine because they have mitigation and

275
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,519
f-secure like many vendors in this room

276
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,390
also have machine learning vincent wafer

277
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,250
for McAfee it was on the gateway it

278
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,350
probably was a true false positive if

279
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,910
you want to call it that on the Gateway

280
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,040
heuristic aliy I think it's acceptable

281
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,220
but again it's that would have been seen

282
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,079
on the endpoint

283
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,329
I loved how Ryan described this because

284
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:25,940
it's a valid approach just because it

285
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,850
doesn't do something bad it doesn't mean

286
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,740
you don't detect it it doesn't appear to

287
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,930
do anything good at all and what he's

288
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,690
talking about is application reputation

289
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,910
you get that in smart screen you get

290
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,519
that in Google Safe Search it's a very

291
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,279
valid way of blocking unknown malware

292
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,140
you're gonna get some unknown clean

293
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,050
files developers can get off of the bad

294
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:54,620
application reputation list here's one

295
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,870
false positive means false positive well

296
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,250
what about this four out of how I mean

297
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,339
you know 57 is it a false positive at

298
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:06,680
four have it's a I don't care it's

299
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,840
adware up up whatever and

300
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,630
testing that's not a valid sample now as

301
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,670
a consumer I might care I might not want

302
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,250
and I might even say consistently

303
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,980
products detect more pups than others

304
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,470
that their methodology their

305
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,330
decision-making is different I want the

306
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,700
one that gets the pups to but that's

307
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,890
frequently also a configuration thing in

308
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,800
the GUI detection by more scanners is

309
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,490
better coverage oh man that one drives

310
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,279
me nuts the number of scanners that

311
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,790
detect a file are not relevant as much

312
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,430
as how many people in corporations are

313
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:52,130
actually protected so virustotal here 32

314
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,610
out of 64 is that good coverage bad

315
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,390
coverage mediocre coverage well let's

316
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:03,260
look at who's got it on lab this speaks

317
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,690
to geographical geography makes a

318
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,760
difference on labs in Korea so we've got

319
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,380
some Korean coverage here Avast has a

320
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,050
large market share I do

321
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:19,430
China ESET has a large market share

322
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,070
Kaspersky does Malwarebytes does too

323
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,660
however malwarebytes is a bit

324
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,730
interesting because frequently it's used

325
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,520
after the fact it's not unless you have

326
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,230
a paid version that won't protect you as

327
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,790
it comes in but it's good for the

328
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,890
techies that are trying to help a friend

329
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:38,150
clean up McAfee

330
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:42,380
Jihu 360 China again rising China China

331
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,860
seems to have really good coverage

332
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,680
Tencent would make it better Trend Micro

333
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,850
so we're seeing a lot of people being

334
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:57,200
covered but look who missed it Microsoft

335
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,050
and Symantec that's a large number of

336
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,180
people and if Symantec had gotten that

337
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,790
one in this case you could have had 10

338
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,010
scanners that detected it not detect it

339
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,070
and more people are protected in fact in

340
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,400
this case you know 14 out of 58 it looks

341
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,970
like pretty poor protection but Symantec

342
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,250
got it and that protected a heck of a

343
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,360
lot of people

344
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,460
Jihu and rising that whole

345
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,560
some China you know Kaspersky ISA the

346
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,430
vast so it's not the number of scanners

347
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,860
it's the number of people that they

348
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,240
protect that matters for coverage okay

349
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,339
malicious website means malicious

350
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:40,540
website another myth

351
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,570
this was an interesting one to me the

352
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,089
detection ratio three site said it's

353
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,700
malicious that's not uncommon even with

354
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,680
really malicious websites that's not

355
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,660
uncommon for just a couple they call it

356
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,800
bad but in this case that site is a

357
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,620
legitimate political party one of the

358
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,440
oldest political parties in Hong Kong

359
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,900
and their site was compromised

360
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,990
and I found this very interesting that

361
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,660
when you go to the URL there's this PHP

362
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,400
file and some of the data you can get

363
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,309
from virustotal is what other file names

364
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:19,939
have we seen it under and when I'm not

365
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,800
gonna go through the whole step but one

366
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,470
of the other file names I saw was the

367
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,599
name of a tool it ended up with that zip

368
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,710
a zip and a PHP as you know but in the

369
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,830
file name it said arpan and so what's

370
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:37,429
arpan and arpan is a chinese website and

371
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:41,270
I don't read Chinese so thank you google

372
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,540
for translating it for me and you see

373
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:49,940
this Wi-Fi Universal key what could go

374
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,860
wrong so I go click on it and I come to

375
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,530
the app information page QR code you can

376
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,950
just scan it and download it there was

377
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,720
below there a button for download so I

378
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,780
use the button and what could possibly

379
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,270
go wrong so it's interesting that you

380
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,250
can chain events together through the

381
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,740
forensic information virustotal provides

382
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,200
and find out where it ends up at

383
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,490
virustotal is not real time protection

384
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,860
and they stress that the quoted part is

385
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,900
virus told themselves they don't replace

386
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,360
other security products are fantastic

387
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,220
but that's not what they try to do and

388
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,010
so because these presentations are

389
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,690
supposed to be vendor-neutral i'm going

390
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,840
to show a couple other scanning services

391
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,570
jadi actually is the one that's closest

392
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,130
to

393
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,020
virustotal they have fewer scanners but

394
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,470
some people hate virus I hate Google so

395
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,970
they're not going to do that and Giada

396
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,799
is an alternative for me what I really

397
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,270
liked about Johnny when I was

398
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,730
researching this virustotal is rolling

399
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,500
out a new interface it's pretty cool but

400
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,909
it's not throughout the world and I

401
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:57,740
started with the old interface and I had

402
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,440
to go to different countries for my VPN

403
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,140
in order to get you know the same types

404
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,960
of output and the problem was that I

405
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,510
point my VPN at Spain and everything's

406
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,149
coming back in Spanish now with jadi you

407
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:13,460
can actually choose what language you

408
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,320
want to see no matter what pop you're

409
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,110
coming out of payloads secure it is

410
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,730
another one they have a hybrid scanner

411
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,120
they call it a strong on heuristics in

412
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,890
virustotal there's a little place where

413
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,320
it has comments and typically these

414
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,070
comments are useless but payloads are

415
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,380
typically really good they provide some

416
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,580
information heuristic information and

417
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,559
it's pretty rich it's like this document

418
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:42,039
you know risk assessment remote access

419
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:47,750
fingerprinting the Machine it's you know

420
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,919
it detects stealthiness there's a

421
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,149
variety system security a variety of

422
00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:58,039
heuristic indicators which you combine

423
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,380
those with what virustotal just told you

424
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,090
and now you're getting some forensic

425
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,000
information and I like that they give

426
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,010
most recently submitted because it's

427
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,380
kind of fun to see what's been submitted

428
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,809
most recently what might be attacking me

429
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:16,880
very soon there's NSS Labs NSS no longer

430
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,909
has the free version of cause which is

431
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:22,880
too bad it was fun but NSS isn't about

432
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,980
virus scanning they're not about malware

433
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,590
scanning they're really about providing

434
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,350
a threat information and do you have a

435
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:34,100
threat feed but also down below this is

436
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,429
more global this the bypassing security

437
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:39,740
products is talking about a specific

438
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,750
profile what products that I choose in

439
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,809
my environment that I want tested so

440
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:46,640
this was the interface and they don't

441
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,500
scan all file types there they're very

442
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,520
exploit

443
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,820
centric and so you have a limited set

444
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,560
and they're looking for exploits in the

445
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,280
documents etc and so here I have Windows

446
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,070
Defender Barracuda and far Dannette and

447
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,980
you can see these detection czar blocks

448
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,570
they're actually blocks or exploits are

449
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,370
all over the place but at school I can

450
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,930
also choose applications in my

451
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:13,940
environment Kataria labs own their their

452
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,920
focus actually is on helping protect

453
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:22,130
website owners and they help get people

454
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,720
off blacklist too which is really

455
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,790
important it's a difficult thing to do

456
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,800
so their product one of their products

457
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,640
is threat sign and this explains

458
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,290
basically any website built manage

459
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,300
hosted on any platform that's what

460
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,400
they're trying to perfect protect it's

461
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,530
just happens that they also have a URL

462
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,570
scanner and they provide information

463
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,880
about like what how many files are being

464
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:50,480
downloaded at the time they also like

465
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,400
this site has been blacklisted if I'm a

466
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,650
customer I want to know is my site been

467
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,550
blacklisted

468
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,160
you know what was being downloaded clean

469
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,380
files malicious files suspicious files

470
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,600
so that's another resource for you and

471
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,520
of course Ops SWAT met a defender and as

472
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,380
I showed earlier there was a time when

473
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,750
virustotal hadn't seen a file ops what

474
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,090
did and so I got that information and

475
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,680
you're gonna find the reverse of it too

476
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,740
but I mean the standing is just part of

477
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,170
overall service and they have some

478
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,970
really cool free tools that you can use

479
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,880
also and of course you know they've got

480
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,450
a big portfolio so yeah you might call

481
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,010
them competition but they're really not

482
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,170
that's just integration with an existing

483
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:37,460
infrastructure so you know I want to

484
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,860
conclude with a few bullets virustotal

485
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,710
provides some great information that a

486
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,830
lot of people don't understand is

487
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,030
available they provide threat

488
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,860
intelligence as do other companies I

489
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,870
don't think most companies IT

490
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,020
professionals are going to use only one

491
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,910
threat feed I don't really consider them

492
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,080
competition for companies providing

493
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,129
thread feeds as much as

494
00:23:03,129 --> 00:23:06,740
complementing a lot of contextual

495
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,749
information if you haven't gone to tabs

496
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:11,389

497
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:12,710

498
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,809
links to hashes where it'll tell you

499
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:16,639
more things if I had more time I would

500
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:19,220
show you this huge chain of events where

501
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,200
a file was clean it's just it showed up

502
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,669
with 30 other malicious files and I

503
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:29,299
really value virus totaling I'm happy
