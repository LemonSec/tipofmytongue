1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,629
hi yes let's mention I'm gonna be

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,730
talking about the consumer spyware

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,670
market this is not financially driven

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,759
malware for cyber criminals or lawful

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,450
intercept for governments this is

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,789
remote-access Trojans for just a normal

7
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:20,189
person that might be to monitor your

8
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,300
child your employees or the context I'm

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,220
going to talk about in is monitoring

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,019
your wife husband lover spouse for

11
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:32,399
spying on them domestically and how

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,260
that's linked to violence and I

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,390
apologize in advance for my coldy voice

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,309
it's just that me I'm a journalist I'm

15
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,920
not a security professional or

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,340
researcher I used to work for I used to

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,739
work for motherboard which is the tech

18
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,770
section of Vice that's why I did most of

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,809
this consumer spyware work and they just

20
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,550
recently moved to The Daily Beast which

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,059
is a US political news site I see you

22
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:04,619
that's the message that Jessica received

23
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,110
on her phone when her ex-husband planted

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,270
malware first on her computer and then

25
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,700
on her mobile phone an Android device I

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,450
believe he could read her text messages

27
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,020
track her GPS location and I think read

28
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,259
her emails as well when she said she

29
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:23,820
would go to one place and then she would

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,680
go somewhere else he would send this

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,140
message I see you in one particularly

32
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,869
violent case the ex-husband sexually

33
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,950
assaulted Jessica and then during the

34
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,140
incident he made reference to text

35
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,170
messages that he had intercepted

36
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,810
presumably or supposedly between her and

37
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,600
a man she was flirting with as a single

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,259
woman I mean that was a particularly

39
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:54,570
egregious example of how this malware

40
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,360
can be used domestically but it's far

41
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,960
from the only case I mean when it first

42
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,320
started this sort of consumer spyware

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,840
was your usual executables attached to

44
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,179
an email you send them maybe you pretend

45
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,160
to be a I don't know a interactive

46
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,170
greeting card

47
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,569
something the person downloads it opens

48
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,910
it up and stores the rat on their device

49
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,910
and there were various media reports

50
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,370
like in the mid 2000 onwards maybe a

51
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,860
little bit earlier where a man was

52
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,290
accused of using the software to spy on

53
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,060
his wife in the UK there was a man who

54
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,050
planted malware on her pc and found out

55
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,700
there were communications between her

56
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,830
and a man whose marriage was also

57
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,500
failing and the husband ended up

58
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,870
stabbing her murdering her several

59
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,090
stabbing her several times in the chest

60
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,140
and then you have many more examples of

61
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,709
men just spying on the wife's internet

62
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:57,350
browsing activity I suppose I should

63
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,420
just say now I was going to mention it

64
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,720
later but this isn't just husbands

65
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,590
spying on wives

66
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,209
we have evidence as I'll go into later

67
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:09,080
of wives spying on husbands I don't have

68
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,100
any data of the spread but from why I

69
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,840
understand speaking to domestic violence

70
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,180
shelters at least primarily the cases

71
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,590
we've come across husband and wife and

72
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,709
then obviously as smartphones became

73
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:27,230
more popular these companies started

74
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,030
offering spyware for Android and iPhone

75
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,180
devices I think it's over this case or

76
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,310
that one I can't remember which but the

77
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,920
malware was used to get a leg up on the

78
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,410
divorce proceedings so the husband could

79
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,239
then find out what the wife was trying

80
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:42,530
to go after and insert these

81
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,019
communications between the wife and her

82
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:53,299
lawyer but I mean a tiny minority of the

83
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,920
instances of this happening are going to

84
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,980
make their way into a media report

85
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,010
according to an NPR study and then one

86
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,140
from domestic violence shelters they

87
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,970
surveyed I think 70 shelters and 75%

88
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,170
said that they were dealing with people

89
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,600
that had some sort of tracking app on

90
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,190
their phone or their computer so a huge

91
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,209
number of cases are going through

92
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,709
shelters but they don't typically get

93
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,460
reported so to get a better idea I

94
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,000
bought some

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,460
of this now where there's typically sold

96
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,180
to or marketed for this use this was spy

97
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,200
phone wreck pro I think for $170 which

98
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,990
is relatively expensive for malware in

99
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,050
this market it's pretty simple you get

100
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,180
physical access to the device you go to

101
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,870
a domain you download an apk you turn

102
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,230
off the install from untrusted sources

103
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,510
setting on Android and then you're good

104
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:55,110
to go you just type in a subscription

105
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,790
code as well because many of these

106
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,590
malware companies will sell one month

107
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,200
two months six months a year long

108
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,310
subscription packages to continue

109
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:08,120
getting money out of their customers and

110
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,620
some of you know one in particular just

111
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,990
whenever I bring this up these are sort

112
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,090
of the reactions I get this is pretty

113
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,700
crap malware it's not sexy it's not

114
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,830
sophisticated you need physical access

115
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,550
it is really technically boring and it

116
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,669
is truly but that would be to

117
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:29,130
misunderstand the threat that the people

118
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:34,169
who face this malware face I mean these

119
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:35,130
people are going to be in the same

120
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,770
building the same room maybe even the

121
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,229
same bed so a physical access threat is

122
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:42,660
a legitimate issue that these people

123
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,960
need to face and then you could say well

124
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,130
just don't give your phone to your

125
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,110
husband or your wife put a passcode on

126
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,470
that sort of thing one case described to

127
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,030
me by someone who's familiar with it I'm

128
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,000
tracking her to explain this for lack of

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,030
a better word the wife gave consent the

130
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,970
husband said look if you really love me

131
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,979
I want to protect you you have to let me

132
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,780
install this malware on your device I'm

133
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,400
the one that loves you and I'm the one

134
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,890
who's trying to protect you so she

135
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,110
installed this stuff on her Android

136
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,300
phone and that's how then she was

137
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,020
tracked the point I'm trying here is the

138
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,200
threat is a lot more complicated than

139
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,570
your typical Android security threat or

140
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,860
your smartphone security threat this is

141
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,260
a overlap between physical and digital

142
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,039
security which you may not always see in

143
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,920
your line of work or industry

144
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,780
back to my malware I took it out on a

145
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,780
touristy day out around Berlin took some

146
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,920
photos every 10-15 minutes maybe an hour

147
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,440
the malware will grab the photos and

148
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,420
email them to an address you specify or

149
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,910
you can send the attacker can send a

150
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,610
text message to the phone and then it

151
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,110
will just export rate the data whenever

152
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,590
they feel like it and then you just have

153
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,020
the SMS message it's intercepted

154
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,930
the longitude and latitude of the GPS

155
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,210
locations and in a handy little map you

156
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,640
can click on to show exactly where that

157
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,570
person was located now there are dozens

158
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,750
of companies that sell this sort of

159
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,600
malware I definitely haven't seen all of

160
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,490
them I imagine other journalists and

161
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,870
researchers working the space have not

162
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,410
seen all of them either but just to give

163
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,460
a few examples troops by x ends by heist

164
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,090
and mobile and hello spy and some of

165
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,760
these will mark it explicitly - you can

166
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,320
use this to spy on your wife or husband

167
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,210
and others will say like it does here

168
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,480
with Mobe self oh this is for children

169
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,400
and employees only so you know our hands

170
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,830
are clean I phoned up the Mobe stealth

171
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,800
and asked hey can I use this to spy my

172
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,750
wife yes you can do I need her

173
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,070
permission no you just need physical

174
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,710
access so even though they advertise it

175
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,470
for certain use cases first of all we

176
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,760
can't stop the end-user from doing

177
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,170
whatever they want with malware I mean

178
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,550
that's a problem of the lawful intercept

179
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,800
industry as well as the consumer spyware

180
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,750
one but some of these companies will

181
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,430
just tell their customers yes or you can

182
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,610
do whether you are one with it as well

183
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,070
Mobe stealth also offers a non

184
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,070
jailbroken iphone solution but it's not

185
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,140
actually malware all it is is a tool

186
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,240
that will go into the targets I called

187
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,610
iCloud account and download you know

188
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,040
they're cool logs their photos text

189
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,660
messages all the sort of thing that's

190
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,480
backed up by default in iCloud again

191
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,000
it's it's a lame attack you need the

192
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,570
passcode and the Apple ID to do it but

193
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,570
again I don't know maybe married couples

194
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,640
share passwords in some instances maybe

195
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,260
it's written down our notebook and the

196
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,910
husband or wife can easily find it I

197
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,200
mean to

198
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,510
that sort of attack would be again - we

199
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,980
can all the sort of fret model that

200
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,680
we're dealing with her so I'm just going

201
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,570
to focus on one company in particular

202
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,110
called flexi spy because it's probably

203
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,690
the largest if not one of the largest

204
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,690
and it's also the company we know the

205
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,769
most about in 2017 a hacker targeted

206
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:14,470
flexi spy stole a load of data and gave

207
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,690
it to me and a colleague a motherboard

208
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,029
so we could see the inner workings of

209
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:22,029
this company and its motivations that

210
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:25,449
may not put so public-facing and just

211
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:27,930
give you an idea of the sort of

212
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,949
capability that flexi spies trying to

213
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:32,470
offer one of his catchphrases is know

214
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,940
everything that happens on the computer

215
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,079
or smartphone no matter where you are

216
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:39,510
and that's just some of the data that

217
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,339
the hacker gave us email addresses of

218
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:44,050
customers so you know we can see he was

219
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,480
buying this software spreadsheets

220
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,750
documents files malware code all that

221
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,209
sort of thing some company emails but we

222
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:53,800
honestly didn't get many of them so

223
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,199
didn't really report on them and there's

224
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:58,360
some partial credit card information as

225
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,920
well obviously we didn't publish or do

226
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,630
anything with but just to give you an

227
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,269
idea of how thoroughly these guys were

228
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:08,290
actually owned this is a road map of

229
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,430
flexi spies development they started

230
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,990
with Symbian phones

231
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,720
moving on to BlackBerry's androids

232
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,230
iPhones the typical sort of chronology

233
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,810
you would expect from a company in this

234
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,970
space this is actually a flexi spies own

235
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,769
roadmap I didn't make this this was

236
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:30,430
included in the documents and then just

237
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,680
briefly I mean there is another talk

238
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,569
here about fins by finfisher early on

239
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,990
flexi spy had some sort of connection to

240
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,069
finfisher so there is overlap between

241
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:43,899
the consumers by our business for these

242
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:46,060
wives and husbands and kids and

243
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,069
employees and then the ones that are

244
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:51,370
using more sophisticated malware and 0

245
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,160
days to target activists and criminals

246
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,269
and terrorists as well we're not sure if

247
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:00,190
they did end up working together but

248
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,110
this was a proposal document from flexi

249
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,279
spy saying

250
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,230
oh hey we will make the server psycho

251
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,269
and I think a part of the implant for

252
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:09,569
the Symbian phones and then someone

253
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,740
familiar with finfisher confirm to me

254
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,959
that yeah Tim Fisher was looking for

255
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,990
that sort of thing out of the time but

256
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,610
back to the malware it said no

257
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,249
everything on the phone and they're not

258
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:21,790
joking

259
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,910
there's whatsapp lines Skype WeChat

260
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,129
iMessage anything you could possibly

261
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:29,589
want to extract off that phone flexi spy

262
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,019
is going to be able to do it text

263
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:33,040
messages as well

264
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,519
delete SMS messages read emails

265
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,620
intercept live calls remotely switch on

266
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,480
the microphone remotely switch on the

267
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,749
camera so you can turn into a hot mic

268
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:50,589
and then FaceTime as well and a feature

269
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:52,329
that I'm not sure you would want to use

270
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:54,279
maybe if you were spying just on your

271
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,889
kids or your employees or doing some

272
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:59,889
sort of a legitimate surveillance you

273
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:02,019
can send fake text messages as well and

274
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:05,139
this is from flexi spies Oh marketing on

275
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:06,790
its website I believe and the text says

276
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,550
something like hey sorry but you can't

277
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,980
come over my wife came home early which

278
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,449
is clearly marketing towards the affairs

279
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:20,470
sort of demographic and in keeping with

280
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,680
the consumer spyware sort of crowd this

281
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,600
is the graphical user interface you see

282
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,480
when you log in you just go to portal da

283
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,339
flexi spider or something like they're

284
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:32,620
typing your username and password and

285
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,800
you can easily see the text messages

286
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,329
intercepted the emails the calls

287
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:39,879
recorded their last GPS locations on the

288
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:44,139
map the photos and anything else and

289
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,480
then just a few weeks ago affected by

290
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,639
introducing an app you can use so the

291
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,870
attacker will install it on their own

292
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,480
phone and they can just look at all the

293
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,160
siphoned or interceptor data that way so

294
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,079
they can do it wherever they may be

295
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,870
I haven't tried this but I have no

296
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,410
reason to believe that it doesn't work

297
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,939
but you can just see how they're

298
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:05,529
constantly updating and constantly

299
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:09,629
trying to cater to their given audience

300
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:12,850
one of the things that separates flexi

301
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,860
spy from the rest of the market was that

302
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,600
until

303
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,240
at least recently they were really

304
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,060
explicit in their marketing towards

305
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,340
jealous lovers spouses that sort of

306
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:23,670
thing

307
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,830
so many spouses cheaply always you they

308
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,230
all use cell phones their cell phone

309
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,900
will tell you what they won't faxes by

310
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,630
removed a lot of this marketing after

311
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:37,290
media reports into the company recently

312
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,170
and they also ask the Internet Archive

313
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,530
to remove all crews of their website so

314
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,330
you can't go through flexi spy right now

315
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,580
and find evidence of this

316
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,550
luckily journalists and researchers have

317
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,870
taken screenshots as well this is I'm I

318
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,310
just said that about the Internet

319
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,400
Archive this is a screenshot before

320
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,660
selected by asked the Internet Archive

321
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,680
to remove it this is a survey that flexi

322
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,300
spy apparently did of its own customers

323
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,920
and you can see over fifty percent is

324
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,170
the reason I would be interested in

325
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,210
using your product is because I believe

326
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,520
my chart my partner may be cheating

327
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,090
the rest are I need to monitor my

328
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,650
employees I want to keep an eye on my

329
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,940
children the other things you would

330
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,000
expect but clearly the majority if the

331
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,700
survey is accurate were looking into the

332
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,530
project for this some sort of domestic

333
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:32,160
spying that this and it's no accident in

334
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,490
the internal documents we obtained flexi

335
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,710
spy I had clearly done a lot of search

336
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,890
engine optimization research these are

337
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,090
some of the terms they were looking for

338
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:42,690
in English

339
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,750
cheating wife wife cheating cheating

340
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,180
husbands et cetera and then the same but

341
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,520
in Russian they seemed particularly keen

342
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,110
on breaking into the Russian market but

343
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,880
they had about three four five

344
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,160
competitors in that space and I I don't

345
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,900
know how successful flaky spy wasn't

346
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,210
breaking into that market but this is a

347
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,220
global thing and they weren't just going

348
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,170
to cater to the English language crowd

349
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,360
but rather than take that survey or the

350
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,640
marketing at face value I spoke to

351
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,280
people who say they have used it to spy

352
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,190
on the husbands or wives using those

353
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,250
emails may just contact a load of people

354
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,710
and say hey did you know flexi spice

355
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,300
been hacked no they haven't told us well

356
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,010
okay first it's been hacked

357
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,500
and I have your customer data can we

358
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,110
chat and while you use this product

359
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,190
obviously giving them anonymity because

360
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,680
I kind of valued their responses over

361
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,420
identifying these random people I don't

362
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,520
even know be particularly fair but one

363
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,380
says I bought it to see if my boyfriend

364
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,300
was cheating another one said they used

365
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,830
it to spy on their ex-girlfriend and

366
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,410
apparently catch her in the act I mean

367
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,560
presumably meaning cheating on him with

368
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,290
a remote recording of her I couldn't

369
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,970
verify that but that's what they claimed

370
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,100
and then possibly the most bizarre one

371
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,290
was that someone said it's normal to

372
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,470
plant spyware on your spouse's device

373
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:05,190
and then monitor them and these were

374
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,040
from all intents and purposes totally

375
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,770
ordinary people there were some law

376
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,600
enforcement officers in there and we've

377
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,860
reported on that as well and it looks

378
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,050
like they were using flexi spy possibly

379
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,180
for criminal investigations which is

380
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,790
legitimate and firing but there were

381
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,200
there was a fifth-grade teacher at

382
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,450
Washington DC professional job burger

383
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,790
from Georgia and then the president of a

384
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:31,040
sunglasses distributor in New York and

385
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,420
as you can see the concentration there

386
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,170
is in the states but this is a worldwide

387
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,290
phenomenon as well as flexi spy hackers

388
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,240
also targeted a company called retina x

389
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,150
and they managed to get the actual

390
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,430
contents there was xx we'll treated from

391
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,430
the malware so photos text messages that

392
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,580
sort of thing as well as GPS locations

393
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,690
of the targets the infected phones so

394
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,240
they gave us those I just did a quick

395
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,000
script to obviously obfuscate the actual

396
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,690
GPS locations I will share those they're

397
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,699
everywhere South America South Africa

398
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,699
West Africa through Europe into

399
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:15,060
Southeast Asia as I mentioned this is a

400
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,720
totally global trade even though the

401
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,339
majority of the websites maybe mean in

402
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,410
the English language clearly people

403
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,060
across the planet are buying and using

404
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,380
this malware I think in total we got

405
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,110
information on a hundred and thirty

406
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,690
thousand accounts which include a flexus

407
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,380
by our retina Rex but that's probably

408
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,510
not representative of how

409
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,460
many customers they actually have the

410
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,380
way flexi spy was hacked the hacker went

411
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,480
in and basically enumerated through the

412
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,030
customer portal which every emails were

413
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,830
available to them but from what we

414
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,850
understand they probably actually have

415
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,470
more customers as well and a lot of

416
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,170
those people are going to be breaking

417
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,350
the law I mean in the u.s. is a criminal

418
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,320
offense to intercept communications if

419
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,240
you don't have a warrant or don't have

420
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,160
consent just to put it very generally

421
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,050
I'm not a lawyer the US DOJ has charged

422
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,660
people at least one person for using

423
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,970
this sort of spyware in this case their

424
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,030
woman planted it on the phone of a law

425
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,520
enforcement official and intercepted

426
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,080
communications that were private but

427
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,420
also law enforcement privileged which

428
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,460
the skeptic in me thinks that's probably

429
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,080
the only reason that the DOJ actually

430
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,150
went after this person was because they

431
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:37,070
actually implicated a an official and

432
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,500
then just very briefly on this business

433
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,430
side there is a vibrant community of

434
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,930
youtubers and bloggers who get money

435
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,450
from advertising this piece of software

436
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,510
so in this terribly acted video

437
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,120
apparently of Susan she says how great

438
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,670
the malware is and oh my god I don't

439
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,920
know how I lived before flexi spy and I

440
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,990
caught my husband and it's just the best

441
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,820
thing ever please buy it from this link

442
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,450
which I get 20% off and then you will

443
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,070
follow through the referral links and

444
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,570
you'll find the end up going to the same

445
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,420
people there will be I'm not sure maybe

446
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,680
four or five different YouTube channels

447
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,110
but then they all go to the same

448
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,370
affiliate link so clearly it's the same

449
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,260
person too and generate income from this

450
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,600
as well and their m spies just mentioned

451
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,800
their which is a company i didn't really

452
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,320
go into but they're another of the of

453
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,090
the large ones but they don't market for

454
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,970
spouses or lovers at least recently as

455
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:35,010
far as I know and then even if flexi spy

456
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,590
sells its malware and you may say no

457
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,760
that's not for me I'm gonna go somewhere

458
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,880
else you may inadvertently be buying the

459
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,350
same code because flexi spy offers the

460
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,720
justice malware there's a white label so

461
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,580
you can take it and then say my flexi

462
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,960
spy reseller

463
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,090
you can take it and then say hey I'm now

464
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,540
spouse Buster's 3000 and this is my

465
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,190
malware it's really really great please

466
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,260
buy it from me and the resellers are

467
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,330
based all over the world Israel India

468
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,540
Australia the u.s. flexi spy itself is

469
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,930
based in Thailand but they're all over

470
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,720
the place I learned out the company

471
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,510
names because I couldn't verify that

472
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,640
every single one was a reseller I mean

473
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,530
it's an internal document you don't know

474
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,690
whether it's a work in protest work in

475
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,880
progress document or somewhere of a

476
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,640
caveat to it so I confirmed one that was

477
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,520
called bounce Buster's in Australia but

478
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,620
the rest I just load out for that

479
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:37,410
purpose and as well as the users who may

480
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,640
be breaking the law if they're

481
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,050
intercepting without a warrant or

482
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,180
without consent whatever it may be the

483
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,390
companies as well are likely breaking at

484
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,390
least US law a company called

485
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,230
stealthGenie

486
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,950
there was marketed to spouses and lovers

487
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,660
there it was a Danish citizen who I

488
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,930
think was Pakistani born and the reason

489
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,730
the u.s. took it was because the website

490
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,820
was on some amazon web server in

491
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,860
Virginia so they go now you have US

492
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,890
authorities after you that person

493
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,200
pleaded guilty was obviously convicted

494
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,330
for their crime and just got as you can

495
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,150
see that half a million dollar fine no

496
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,090
prison time as far as I know so that may

497
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,430
not sound like that much of a big deal

498
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,670
when it comes to punishments but you

499
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,960
have to remember then this person

500
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,400
presumably has all the other things that

501
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,160
come with being a convict which is you

502
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,450
know you can't enter the u.s. as easily

503
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,780
you may get deported whatever it may be

504
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,590
the FBI has no files on flexi spy I do

505
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,050
the check and they said no we don't with

506
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,790
well they implied they weren't

507
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,380
investigating them they just said they

508
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,790
didn't have any documents related to

509
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,250
that company and this is the only one

510
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,250
that the DOJ has charged and prosecuted

511
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,120
in 2014 when they did it the DOJ threw a

512
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,660
big fanfare and released a good-looking

513
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,160
press release and said look this is the

514
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,990
first time we've ever done it and this

515
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,440
2017 they haven't done

516
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,540
and dozens of these companies still

517
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,480
exist that was it

518
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,820
my trying to keep it short and sweet if

519
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,400
you ever want to chat about anything off

520
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,430
the record or you have details on one of

521
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,200
these companies being lawful intercept

522
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,050
or the consumer spy where you can chat

523
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,840
to me anytime and especially if you have

524
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,490
stories or you know someone who may have

525
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,740
stories about this malware being used on

526
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,040
domestic violence I'm trying to continue

527
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,360
to talk to those people to get a better

528
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,939
understanding of what exactly this
