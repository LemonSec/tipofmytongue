1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,179
sorry mom alright thanks hi everybody

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:04,710
I'm Andrew Brandt I'm the director of

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,170
threat research at Symantec thank you

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,490
all for coming

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,679
just before we get started on the talk I

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,960
wanted to let you all know I'm a very

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,969
interactive kind of person and I would

8
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,500
encourage you all if you have questions

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,449
to just go ahead and raise your hand

10
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:19,949
during the talk I don't mind being

11
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,080
interrupted anybody who asks a question

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,789
can come up and take a prize I've got

13
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:26,609
some pumpkin spice caramels and some CDs

14
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,279
and magnets and stuff nothing fancy but

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,260
it's cool and I just want you guys to be

16
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,180
interactive and and be you know

17
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,800
participating so we're going to talk a

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,329
little bit about some of the work I've

19
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,340
been doing with trick bot the last

20
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,850
couple of months I do weekly internal

21
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,579
WebEx at Symantec teaching the sales

22
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:45,780
engineers and a bunch of other people

23
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,300
how to do malware analysis and research

24
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,860
into these kinds of things and so I'm

25
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,969
going to talk a little bit about my

26
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,879
tools and things I use in my lab to do

27
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,020
research and then I'm going to show you

28
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,539
what we were able to find so this is my

29
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,440
rack in the lab in Draper Utah it

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,650
consists of a few different tools not

31
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,000
all of them are listed on this sheet but

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,200
the main ones that I'm going to be

33
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,580
talking about today are security

34
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,100
analytics and the SSL visibility

35
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,439
appliance SSL visibility is sort of the

36
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,650
key tool here which is it's a standalone

37
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,710
man-in-the-middle SSL decryption box all

38
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,080
you have to do is generate certs on the

39
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,170
device but those certs into the cert

40
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,630
store on your whatever machine you want

41
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,210
to inspect and then anything that is

42
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,479
sent over TLS to that machine the box

43
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,790
will resign the certs and send the

44
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,490
decrypted traffic out to basically any

45
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,900
device that you want if you want to

46
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,820
capture it so I'm capturing it with

47
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,680
security analytics and security

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,740
analytics is a sort of enterprise-grade

49
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,759
packet capture tool that can sort of

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,530
capture the entire networks traffic all

51
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,579
at once and while it does that it's

52
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,600
collecting a bunch of metadata about

53
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,610
every packet and putting those that

54
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,250
metadata into a database which you can

55
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,890
then browse through a nice UI so let's

56
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,069
talk a little bit about the history so

57
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:11,610
now almost three years ago I did a

58
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,560
presentation about

59
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,540
basically what are the sort of current

60
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,140
trends in BOTS and I did a section about

61
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,069
BOTS called Dyer and this was what we

62
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:26,069
were able to discover about Dyer three

63
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:28,110
years ago is that it was doing

64
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,390
everything over TLS and a lot of the

65
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,910
communications once you decrypted the

66
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,270
TLS were in plain text or fairly easy to

67
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,209
sort of read and understand and we were

68
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:42,720
even able to kind of parse by inference

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,300
the the command structure that was used

70
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,590
for Dyer and that was fun and then when

71
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,630
I sort of saw trick BOTS traffic for the

72
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,160
first time earlier this year I thought

73
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,150
oh wow

74
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,580
Dyer is back how weird because it looked

75
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,940
exactly the same and and then I read the

76
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,060
blog by Jerome Segura from Malwarebytes

77
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,590
where he's basically said that trick bot

78
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,840
is a rewritten version of Dyer it all

79
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,190
made sense so in the end what we started

80
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,640
to see was a very familiar set of

81
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,560
commands these are the commands here and

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,640
I'm sorry it's kind of hard to read

83
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,040
because it's such a light screen but

84
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,890
basically all of this stuff that was

85
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,720
being done by Dyer is essentially being

86
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,060
done by trick bot it's a little bit more

87
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,920
streamlined it's a little bit easier to

88
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,730
read and and they're doing basically the

89
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,579
same stunts that they were doing three

90
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,650
years ago with Dyer there they're doing

91
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,130
TLS but not necessarily over 443 they're

92
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,859
using static user agent strings in the

93
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:45,390
malware to do all the command and

94
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,239
control stuff so it becomes very easy to

95
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,970
identify that traffic using a couple of

96
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,540
different characteristics so what I

97
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,950
started doing was recording a bunch of

98
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,010
the trick bot traffic that we were

99
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,079
decrypting and then kind of looking for

100
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,170
ways to basically abstract it into

101
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,959
simpler ways of understanding what it's

102
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,760
doing and I came it came up with this

103
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,680
list of the commands that were being

104
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
issued and what you can see these are

105
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,459
all the HTTP requests that have been

106
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,979
decrypted but you can see that most of

107
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,240
them are get requests there's a couple

108
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,060
that are posts and that there are

109
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,520
basically this pattern is followed over

110
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,580
and over again ad infinitum as long as

111
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,150
the bot is infected on the machine so

112
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,330
here's how we you know interpreted some

113
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,160
of these things all right so it doesn't

114
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,500
these get requests to sort of provide

115
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,030
information up to the server the

116
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,340
information is in the URI string and

117
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,070
when the server has received it it sends

118
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,040
back / 1 / which is basically okay I've

119
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,130
got it it like I said it's always on -

120
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,710
it's always TLS encrypted but it isn't

121
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,660
necessarily 443 so with trick bots we've

122
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,960
seen some conventional like 443 traffic

123
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,830
but also 447 449 and other weird ports

124
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,750
that you wouldn't expect so if you see

125
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,919
you know SSL over 449 that's almost

126
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:16,449
certainly a trick bot doing

127
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,699
command-and-control

128
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,780
the other thing that we're discovering

129
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,660
is that in many cases but not in all

130
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,570
cases the server is returning weird

131
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,820
error codes it could possibly be the

132
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,889
fact that the server is overloaded or is

133
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:31,479
getting weird responses or they're in

134
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:32,680
the middle of updating it at the time

135
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,630
when we're doing our beaconing but I

136
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,210
think that in some cases the server's

137
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,370
actually intentionally it's trying to

138
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,220
mislead by giving 404 errors so in some

139
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,229
cases and it's kind of predictable with

140
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:46,150
certain kinds of commands that their

141
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,910
server will respond with a 404 now I

142
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,260
don't know for certain because I don't

143
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,180
have a trick bot command and control

144
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,860
server and all their source code to be

145
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,289
able to analyze it but the reality is is

146
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,449
that it is very suspicious that that's

147
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:02,380
the case most of the exfill that you see

148
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,889
with trick thought is done through the

149
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:07,750
get requests but when it's big amounts

150
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,199
of data they use a post data request to

151
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,030
send that stuff up to the server and

152
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,030
then for every instance of trick BOTS

153
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,460
components I don't know if you know this

154
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,560
but basically the bot pulls down a bunch

155
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,150
of dll's and then invokes different

156
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,970
functions from each dll each of those

157
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,130
instances of a different component has

158
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,740
its own basic comp you know common

159
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,080
service host dot exe that it's injecting

160
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,810
into and using for its purposes so what

161
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,240
you see on an infected endpoint when

162
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,300
it's running trick bot is usually a

163
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,260
apparent service host idea

164
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,400
see that's the main service that runs

165
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,680
the bot and then each of the components

166
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,570
is a child process of that service host

167
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,980
which is another service house so there

168
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,390
might be like seven or eight service

169
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,400
hosts underneath it's sort of like the

170
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,740
user level of the machine some others

171
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,420
are meant you know things that I want to

172
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,570
mention about the behavior is that

173
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,180
unlike dire trick bot does not use the

174
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,850
stun protocol to do its determination of

175
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,710
what the public facing IP address is on

176
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,210
the network instead they're using a

177
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,820
bunch of different public services like

178
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,930
I Can Has IP to figure out what their

179
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,610
public facing IP address is and this is

180
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,950
important because when it's profiling

181
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,980
the infected machine it's trying to it

182
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,050
needs to know that public facing IP so

183
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,300
that then command control can can

184
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,110
operate effectively it does all kinds of

185
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,050
credentials and data scraping each of

186
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,030
the components that is pulled down can

187
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,800
scrape different types of data but then

188
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,320
they also can use different components

189
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,840
to do attacks as well so we've seen that

190
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,850
they've already created a module that

191
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:52,240
uses eternal blue to spread laterally

192
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,880
within a network and the screenshot that

193
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,550
I'm showing here is just some slices

194
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,110
from security analytics where we saw

195
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,000
that it was basically running through an

196
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,520
entire you know series of subnets trying

197
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,530
to do eternal blue and when we looked up

198
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,510
the IP address range it belongs to the

199
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,270
US Department of Defense so I just hope

200
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,350
that they don't arrest me on the way

201
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,580
back into the net into the country so it

202
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,100
is also distinctive in that instead of

203
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,710
using a run key or the startup folder in

204
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,850
Windows that it uses the scheduled tasks

205
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,020
mechanism within Windows to create a

206
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,080
scheduled task and that task runs the

207
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,110
main executable that installs trick bot

208
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,780
and does the initial injection about

209
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,080
every 15 minutes on the box so the you

210
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,729
could kill all the service hosts and

211
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,799
that will temporarily stop it but then

212
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,809
15 minutes later system certain you know

213
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,510
the the main executable will run again

214
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,490
it will start up that initial injector

215
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,870
and then that thing will just go and

216
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,430
check to see that it's all installed and

217
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,200
just start running again so there's

218
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,340
really it's

219
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,780
kind of difficult for a lot of people to

220
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,690
get rid of it all right so let's look at

221
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,280
some of the c2 traffic that I was able

222
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,240
to record so here's this is this year's

223
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,950
version of what I showed you that was

224
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,510
the 2014 presentation like I said almost

225
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,100
all of the commands that it's using or

226
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,600
get requests over HTTP the the command

227
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,220
structure basically follows this pattern

228
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,450
that you see up here when the and let me

229
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,070
jump back for one slide because I want

230
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,610
to show you something it's actually

231
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,310
three slides so this is the folder where

232
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,500
the where the software is running from

233
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,650
and what you can see is that there's a

234
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,880
bunch of executables in there these are

235
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,010
different versions of trick bot that

236
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,290
have installed themselves there's also

237
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,060
these fold these files called client ID

238
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,610
group tag last ver and config conf all

239
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,680
of those files are basically created

240
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,690
when the file is initially installed on

241
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,850
the box group tag is a five to six

242
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,640
character short tag that basically

243
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,440
identifies the campaign that's being

244
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,230
used to spread trick bot and so when you

245
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,810
see the URI strings you see that all of

246
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,110
the URIs that are being requested by the

247
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,300
particular version of trick bot will

248
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,280
follow the same group tag they always

249
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,080
have the group tag in the beginning they

250
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,840
also generates a unique identifier for

251
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,460
the infected machine and it sticks the

252
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,530
the identifier inside that client ID

253
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,200
file and then that was also passed in

254
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,170
the URI during the request so jumping

255
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,740
forward let's get back over here so what

256
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,380
we see is that you've got the group tag

257
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,900
up here is the first thing within the

258
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,810
URI there's of the machine that it's on

259
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,670
and I've just got those off you skated

260
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,520
for for obvious reasons there's a sort

261
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,430
of the NT code mechanism for showing

262
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,840
which version of Windows is running in

263
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:55,330
this case it's it says when w6 to 9200

264
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,290
that's windows 8 client ID is is hidden

265
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,960
but it's basically 32 bytes it kind of

266
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,690
looks like an md5 hash then the command

267
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,440
is a set of both a number

268
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,740
and a name of a module and each of the

269
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,070
modules is named as a unique name the

270
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,020
command is basically the number and

271
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,060
we've done some inferences on sort of

272
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,130
what those commands are based on

273
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,990
observed behavior and the network

274
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,610
traffic that we recorded and then there

275
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,470
are some sub commands or feedback data

276
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,880
that get sent back as part of that so

277
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,260
here's how we inferred some of these

278
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,630
commands so the initial contact the

279
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,810
first time it was requested is a slash 0

280
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,830
slash spk is the is the first command

281
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,290
that you see and that's just a check-in

282
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,250
and all that's passed up to the the

283
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,840
machine is just a get request and it

284
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,630
comes back with a 1 the next thing you

285
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,410
see is is a 5 which is to download some

286
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,290
payloads and then those payloads are

287
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,940
downloaded and as it's doing the the

288
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,060
payload downloading its profiling the

289
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,120
Machine sending information back

290
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,500
requesting more payloads based on what

291
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,350
that profile says those prose payloads

292
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,120
will then run and they will send back

293
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,540
data individually as well there's also

294
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,970
some other commands like just sort of

295
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,400
like a you know TB phone home is num is

296
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,000
number 25 63 is a issue a command to

297
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,930
this particular payload 64 is used at

298
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,690
least as far as we know exclusively by

299
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,370
the eternal blue exploit which is called

300
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,370
worm DLL and then there's there's a

301
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,920
component called mail client which is

302
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,550
able to send out more sort of weaponized

303
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,640
documents in email using the email

304
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,440
addresses that it has scraped off of the

305
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,720
machine and when it does that it uses

306
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,680
send to send that up information out

307
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,760
there's also a couple of other commands

308
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,530
slash 10 and slash 23 which I just

309
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,870
haven't really puzzled through yet but

310
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,510
we'll get there so some of the

311
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,130
information that it's sending is this

312
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,890
profiling data and it sends this all in

313
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,580
actually in plain text

314
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,260
so once you've decrypted the traffic

315
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,720
it's it's easy to just see when this

316
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,140
thing's does it's system info post it

317
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,150
sends back a pretty detailed profile all

318
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,149
the installed applications and services

319
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:23,829
and a lot of details about the hardware

320
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:26,620
that the machine is running and there's

321
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,149
a couple reasons why they might be doing

322
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:29,709
this obviously they want to know about

323
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:30,939
the environment that they're in they

324
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:32,110
want to know about the user accounts

325
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,120
that are on this machine but they also

326
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,529
want to know is it running in a sandbox

327
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:40,120
is it running a VM and so actually in

328
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,279
this case it was running we ran this

329
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,829
sample in one of our sandbox is called

330
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:47,319
malware analysis appliance and it is

331
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:49,809
essentially a kind of souped up

332
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:52,350
VirtualBox running within a server and

333
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,559
but we've masked the signatures of the

334
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,999
CPU IDs and other things as a way of

335
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:00,550
kind of evading sandbox detection so it

336
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,529
reports back that it was running a you

337
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:06,279
know core i7 in this case and it just

338
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,019
sends all of this stuff is like a giant

339
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:11,379
post after that it then starts

340
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:12,970
downloading configuration data and it

341
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,980
does this sort of on a regular basis it

342
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,230
cycles through it basically every 15

343
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,209
minutes and pulls down configuration

344
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:21,269
data for three different kinds of

345
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:23,740
different banking attacks that it will

346
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,290
use and it sort of tailors those attacks

347
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,269
to specific banks and the login

348
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:31,420
information that they store and also how

349
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,279
their web pages work so some pretty

350
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,889
interesting stuff and it's worth noting

351
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:41,679
down these URLs because all of this

352
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,259
configuration data is sent down in sort

353
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:47,139
of an encrypted mode and the decryption

354
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:50,379
tool that you can use to read it is on

355
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:51,790
this URL right here this trick BOTS

356
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,910
decode so that's a user on Twitter name

357
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,129
hiciera Zod has a lot of tools in her

358
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,230
github and one of them is this sort of

359
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,149
trick bot configuration decoder and it's

360
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:03,370
really useful so even though you don't

361
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,370
have access to the box itself if you're

362
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,620
doing this SSL decryption and recording

363
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,059
this traffic in in something like

364
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:11,740
security analytics you can just pull

365
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,569
these configuration files off the wire

366
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:17,019
and decode them and figure out not only

367
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:18,790
what banks are they targeting but what

368
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,829
the command-and-control server is that's

369
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:23,470
waiting to sort of listen to the

370
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,730
extraction of the the credentials and

371
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,679
you can block those IPs that's useful

372
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,480
because the division that I work with at

373
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,600
Symantec classifies URLs and IP

374
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,890
addresses as male

375
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,890
and then we use our proxies that are out

376
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,260
you know big enterprise environments to

377
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,750
to block connections to those so in

378
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,579
theory our customers are kind of

379
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:47,709
protected they at least this bot cannot

380
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:50,200
exfiltrate the credentials to these IP

381
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,510
addresses because we know about them and

382
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,050
we're blocking them the other thing that

383
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,000
I wanted to mention is that but just

384
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,540
before I got here another researcher

385
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,610
contacted me and said hey you should

386
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,200
really read my research I've been doing

387
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,050
a lot of work on trick bot and he wrote

388
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,089
this really fascinating blog post that's

389
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:11,980
about the specific injection methods

390
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,750
that trick bot is using which I'm not

391
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,940
going to go into detail with here but

392
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,269
his post is here and I highly recommend

393
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,459
you you read it because it is a very

394
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:23,740
interesting thing it explains what the

395
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,720
different types of injections that are

396
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,670
being used to sort of steal the

397
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,279
credentials are and so this one is the

398
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,440
Dinge

399
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,060
configuration then there's one that's

400
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,360
called singe and it is slightly

401
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,040
different than the other configuration

402
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,199
and what it discovered yesterday is that

403
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,870
you know the two researchers from f5

404
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,399
were here and they were talking about

405
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:48,899
doing decrypting of traffic and data and

406
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,699
they explained to me what this NH was so

407
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:53,320
the way that it works is that there's

408
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,149
there's basically data that's being sent

409
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:57,339
up to the server the command and control

410
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:01,269
server that kind of lets them know which

411
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:03,220
banks specifically the credentials that

412
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,650
are being sent are from and each of

413
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,750
these weird-looking URLs is basically

414
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,339
just a unique identifier for each

415
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,049
particular bank and then they do change

416
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:13,780
over time but you see that like you know

417
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,949
there's the targeted Bank and then

418
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:16,449
there's its unique identifier here

419
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:18,549
there's also capability to sort of

420
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:21,309
create a 404 page for the bank but none

421
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:25,209
of them are being used right now finally

422
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:27,130
there's some other config data ones

423
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,190
called D post the other one is male conf

424
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,870
these are you the post is used by the

425
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,540
main Trojan to do credential theft male

426
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,970
conf is used to do theft of male

427
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,440
credentials as well as email addresses

428
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,270
in Outlook and other male clients and

429
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,780
it's used to send mail from the infected

430
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,210
machine on occasion

431
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,940
both of these are also decrypted using

432
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,250
the tool that was created by her

433
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,100
Shahrazad so really useful tool and all

434
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,960
you can see here is that there's some

435
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,580
binary data but there's some IP

436
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,320
addresses in there as well things that

437
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,260
we want to block and that's good all

438
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,010
right so when when the thing does its

439
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,410
periodic check-in normally it gets a

440
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,440
slash one slash and then the bot goes

441
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,050
away for 60 seconds to 3 minutes and

442
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,230
then it goes and checks in again and

443
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,550
periodically one of those things will

444
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,160
not be / 1 / it will be a string of data

445
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,380
that's a little bit longer and it's very

446
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,440
easy to see that in in tools and and so

447
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,070
this is the artifact of a particular

448
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,020
download that was requested for a

449
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,480
machine called victim and it says go to

450
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,920
this IP address and get 397 dot PNG and

451
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,350
that turns out to be and executable and

452
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,790
so similar in a similar vein we have

453
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,160
another one here where it was it

454
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,720
basically sends a command to a different

455
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,060
box and it's and the command is share

456
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,870
dll control in fact and when it did that

457
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,620
so this is the the request where the the

458
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,020
data that came back was this the next

459
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,750
thing that happened did I lose my mic

460
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,970
the next thing that happens is that

461
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,060
share DLL 64 is downloaded and you can

462
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,740
see that it's a it's a binary data file

463
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,020
it doesn't get decrypted until it ends

464
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,510
up on the infected endpoint in which

465
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,850
point trick bot then turns it into a

466
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,120
real DLL and it can go off and do its

467
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,460
thing and then you can see here that

468
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,170
like the next thing that happened was it

469
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,720
downloaded yet a second executable that

470
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,960
was another PNG file but that was a PE

471
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,620
file so it was masquerading as an image

472
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:45,190
all right so that's cool and it's nice

473
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,720
to be able to see the traffic and it's

474
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,720
nice to be able to block those IPs

475
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,150
we have this really interesting tool

476
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,440
that we created internally called

477
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,330
billiard-room which is a sort of data

478
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,830
correlation tool that allows us to

479
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,960
cross-reference file hashes P addresses

480
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,070
domain names and some who

481
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,639
records and in addition to showing like

482
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,409
where things are talking to where

483
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:10,539
they're coming from there's some there's

484
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:12,789
there's a little bit of directionality

485
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:14,679
to it as well so that if a certain IP

486
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,480
address is hosting a lot of malware

487
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,460
we'll see a lot of errors coming out of

488
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,889
it pointing to different other machines

489
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:22,899
or we'll see if it's a

490
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:23,980
command-and-control serve a lot of

491
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,299
arrows pointing to it meaning that

492
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:27,460
there's malware that is talking to it

493
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,720
and so I'll show you and we we integrate

494
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,399
the Bluecoat data from the division that

495
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,590
I work in the Symantec threat data from

496
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,529
STAR Labs and the Security Response Team

497
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,840
and and a bunch of third party outside

498
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,929
services as well just so that we can you

499
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:45,669
know understand better what's going on

500
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:48,940
so the first time I did a billiard room

501
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:54,429
query on a single single trick bot

502
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:57,759
sample that's what the map looked like

503
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,440
after five minutes of going through the

504
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,299
database and querying it now it's really

505
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:04,450
hard to read but the idea it so this is

506
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,850
the sample that I started with and from

507
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,590
this sample we were able to determine

508
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,600
well a there's a whole bunch of other

509
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,309
samples that are also talking to these

510
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:15,730
same domains the blue blobs blobs are

511
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,100
the domains that are being communicated

512
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,230
with some of them are the command and

513
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,909
control servers some of those are the IP

514
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:25,539
address things zoomed it in a little bit

515
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:27,700
so it's easier to read hopefully that's

516
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,830
slightly easier so so these ones that

517
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,389
are along this edge you can see are all

518
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:34,779
the different IP address services that

519
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:38,049
they're using to query the for for

520
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:40,059
information to get the IP of the the

521
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:41,590
public facing IP of whatever network

522
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,750
they're on and they're using basically

523
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,460
every service that's out there that they

524
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,370
can find and they don't really care

525
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,980
which one they use and it kind of varies

526
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,480
from day to day which one they're going

527
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,450
to use so it they might use multiple but

528
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,429
usually they just use a single one and

529
00:21:57,429 --> 00:21:59,200
if they can't use it then they'll jump

530
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,330
to the next one but you can see that

531
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,919
there's a lot samples that will talk to

532
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:05,080
you know this one and this one and this

533
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,960
one and this one likewise these are the

534
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,970
command and control servers here the IP

535
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,610
addresses and you can see that the

536
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,350
samples are going to talk to you you

537
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,480
know this one and this one and

538
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,330
you know maybe one other and they move

539
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,030
around a lot that the command and

540
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:26,110
control server is dictated by a config

541
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,540
file that's that's in the initial Trojan

542
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,429
and then that Trojan will periodically

543
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:32,830
update that config file and get new c2

544
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,820
servers as they're going offline or new

545
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,470
ones come online likewise I did some

546
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,660
queries on some of the IPS that are used

547
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,030
for the sort of credential stealing or

548
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,460
the destination of the exfiltration of

549
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,750
credentials in this case so here's the

550
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,710
the D post config file and D post is the

551
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,370
sort of the main a sort of destination

552
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,130
for all the isolated credentials when I

553
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,190
did the billiard-room on it so this is

554
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:12,040
the it's 194 87 102 39 it's this woman

555
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:17,309
here so this domain it's really faint

556
00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:19,809
there's a line here that points to this

557
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:23,230
who is address info at may 10 invest

558
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,840
calm and it turns out that that domain

559
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,059
has been used to register a few other

560
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:30,370
domains including cloud dot place and FX

561
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,830
prime comm and mate and invest calm

562
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,010
obviously and DDoS lab calm and DDoS lab

563
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:41,710
true and DDoS - lab Roo etcetera yeah so

564
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,419
I was actually kind of curious to figure

565
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:45,400
out like I'm why would you want to

566
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,440
invest in May 10th what's May 10th I had

567
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,720
no idea what that date the significance

568
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,669
of that date so I googled it it turns

569
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:53,890
out that May 10th is a holiday

570
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,080
celebrating the Confederates of the

571
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,000
civil war in the United States so the

572
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,970
people who wanted to defend slavery and

573
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:04,540
who are now emboldened by the Russians

574
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,360
and and in their efforts to basically

575
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,919
subvert democracy in the United States I

576
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,030
guess that's why you'd want to invest in

577
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,179
May 10th but there are almost too many

578
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:17,950
leads to follow with this it's there

579
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,410
there's a million threads in these and

580
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,090
you saw how big that network was with

581
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:25,090
with trick bot so let me show you a few

582
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:28,299
of the network i/o sees and then if we

583
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:29,650
we have a few minutes

584
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:35,200
what's our time like okay if we have a

585
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,990
minute I will do my demo so some of the

586
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,419
network IOC s if you're not doing SSL

587
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:42,909
decryption the certificates are always

588
00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:44,919
like alphabet salad so they're just a

589
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:46,510
bunch of junk you'll see that they're

590
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,210
invalid certificates you're doing the

591
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,480
TLS to just to ipv4 addresses there's

592
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,980
never a domain name associated with

593
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,460
trick bots it's all IP addresses it's

594
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,130
doing requests to services that are

595
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,590
doing these public IP dress checking so

596
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,080
if you see a lot of lookups of ICANN has

597
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,350
IP comm or or all these other ones these

598
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:11,049
these services are not generally used by

599
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:13,809
consumers unless they're highly

600
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:15,370
technical folks like people in this room

601
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,500
but that that that aside if you see a

602
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,179
bunch of things on your network that are

603
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:21,130
checking those it's worth probably

604
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,080
looking at the the machines that are

605
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,390
doing those checks and then if you see a

606
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,730
bunch of PNG files coming from what

607
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,039
random websites going to those same

608
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:31,720
machines that are doing those IP lookups

609
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,149
if you if you're able to inspect the

610
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:35,890
contents of those PNG files and you see

611
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,990
that MC header that's a pretty strong

612
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,429
indicator that your you've got tricked

613
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:41,140
by now if you are man in the middling

614
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,419
the the data and you can see things like

615
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:47,409
the headers and and the server responses

616
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:49,779
one of the sort of characteristics of

617
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:52,720
both dire and of trick BOTS is that they

618
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,520
had a consistent user agent string and

619
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,350
in this case the user agent string is

620
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,559
that it's running Windows 10 chrome 57

621
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,010
so if your users machines are not

622
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:05,470
running Windows 10 or you don't have

623
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,480
chrome as part of your install base and

624
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,299
it's not chrome 57 then you know that

625
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:12,490
that's a lie and that's a pretty strong

626
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,950
indicator again that you've got trick

627
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,770
bots doing stuff now that's not to say

628
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:20,559
it will always do that and I suspect

629
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,390
after they probably watch this

630
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,220
presentation the trick bot authors may

631
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,440
change this up a little bit the reality

632
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,169
is that for a long time this has been a

633
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:31,240
pretty easy way to figure out that

634
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,760
they're lying and you know but they

635
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,029
might change that all right so we have

636
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:40,720
time for a demo we have two minutes I'll

637
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,340
skip the demo because it's only just to

638
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,409
show you that we can do the extraction

639
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:45,730
and security analytics and then you can

640
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,860
just decrypt it with the hash Shahrazad

641
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,270
tool so I'll just open it up to

642
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:52,918
questions since there have been
