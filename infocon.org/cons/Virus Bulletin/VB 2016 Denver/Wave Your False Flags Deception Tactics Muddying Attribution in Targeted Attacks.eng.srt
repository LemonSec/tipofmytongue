1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,629
okay welcome to the first session in

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,589
this room there's both sets of speakers

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,570
this morning I've indicated that they've

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,010
got a lot of material would get through

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,840
so I'm not gonna mess around taking

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,460
valuable time introducing them other

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,560
than to say welcome Jana and Brian all

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,810
right guys so as we mentioned we have a

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,180
ton of material and I'm gonna assume

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,029
nobody's looked at the paper yet so

11
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:28,590
we're gonna try to rush through a lot of

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,640
this because we want to get to the meat

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,140
of our argument and then hopefully if

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,430
you're interested you can go dig in

15
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,190
there as a lot of you know we work for

16
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,410
kaspersky with the great team the global

17
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,629
research and analysis team this is my

18
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,850
partner in crime Brian Bartholomew I'm

19
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,270
Juan and as we said it's gonna be a bit

20
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,620
of a whirlwind but for anybody who's not

21
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,680
familiar with our work because of gray

22
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,800
and the kind of research that we do

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,850
we've been kind of at the forefront of

24
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,559
working a lot of these apts and

25
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,180
discovering a lot of these cyber

26
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,520
espionage operations but rather than go

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,800
into any of that in particular we wanted

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,159
to deep dive into a specific aspect of

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,150
the sort of research which is

30
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,010
attribution and it's something that's

31
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,299
obviously gotten very interesting

32
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,270
recently and I expect a lot of you as

33
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,890
anti-malware researchers to be more or

34
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,509
less familiar with the things that you

35
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,189
tend to latch on to and the ways that we

36
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:19,650
tend to do attribution but we'll do a

37
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,070
bit of a quick run through in this so

38
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,810
the first thing we got to talk about is

39
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,479
before we go into when it comes to

40
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,579
attribution the biggest issue that I see

41
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,369
today is that there's no real training

42
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,470
if you're in the government or from the

43
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,909
government world and you're an

44
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:40,170
intelligence analyst you've probably

45
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,030
gone through some sort of training that

46
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,860
they have there that kind of explains

47
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,840
how to use the right words how to do

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,729
proper attribution unfortunately in the

49
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,530
private industry we just don't have that

50
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,990
right now hopefully if somebody develops

51
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,299
of course one day but that is a major

52
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,219
issue another thing we have is

53
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:58,530
visibility so again the government they

54
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,899
kind of see a lot of stuff right then

55
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,460
you have companies in the private sector

56
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,110
that may have very good endpoint

57
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,659
visibility or might have really

58
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,970
Network visibility but unfortunately

59
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,699
nobody has the whole picture so when

60
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:13,580
people were creating pieces and and you

61
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,580
know attributing attacks a lot of times

62
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,840
they tend to just stick with their

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,790
visibility and they don't see the entire

64
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,800
aperture so people need to start doing

65
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,660
that and I'll skip through the next

66
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,120
couple but the last one is kind of

67
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,640
important is that it's really not a

68
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:36,500
secret anymore sorry as much as all of

69
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,569
us like to read these reports the same

70
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:39,830
things happening on the bad guys side

71
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,900
right they're out there they're reading

72
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,300
this stuff and basically it's becoming

73
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,950
commonplace for them to take our

74
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,480
research and then turn it around and use

75
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,459
it against us so kind of important to

76
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:52,340
keep in mind so as I said you know I

77
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,660
expect a lot of you to be familiar with

78
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,280
a lot of these things but as you know we

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,780
tend to kind of latch on to you know

80
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,489
compilation times if what you're looking

81
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:01,280
at is portable executable or you know we

82
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,200
try to generate activity timelines or

83
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,940
understand when some of these thread

84
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,769
actors might be working they love

85
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,540
strings and debug paths and you might

86
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,430
have like language resources left and

87
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,200
these sorts of things tend to allow you

88
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,930
to cluster actors together or at least

89
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,130
get a sense of where they may be coming

90
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,860
from but as I as most of you will

91
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,870
probably know most if not all these

92
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,630
things can be manipulated and what we

93
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,430
want to do is rather than continue to

94
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,310
discuss false flags as a possibility or

95
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,320
a vague threat we want to just jump

96
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,630
straight into a series of in the wild

97
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,239
cases where we have seen at least some

98
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:36,650
level of manipulation or deception

99
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,680
tactics being used in order to be able

100
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,570
to do that I need to ask for a certain

101
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,280
allowance of you which is we as a

102
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,870
company at Kaspersky we don't do

103
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,700
attribution we're attribution agnostic

104
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,620
and I hope that by the end of this

105
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,329
presentation or if you take a glance at

106
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,799
our paper that you'll understand the

107
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,140
reason for that it isn't purely you know

108
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,970
a corporate reason it's that we also

109
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,190
believe that it's so fun jabal it's so

110
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,310
malleable that it's not very wise for us

111
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,870
to come out and say well this is clearly

112
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,359
country a and B that said in order to

113
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:07,010
have a discussion of deception tactics

114
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,870
we do need to be able to at least say

115
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,790
you know it is commonly believed that

116
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,650
this is associated with Russia this is

117
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,620
associated with Israel or so on so I we

118
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,298
hope that you'll give us the distance of

119
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,470
saying that this was heard

120
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,600
the attribution grapevine this is what

121
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,790
people normally believe and not to

122
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,080
atribute some of these attribution

123
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,180
claims to us directly it's all Russia

124
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,620
anyway okay so getting into the good

125
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,310
stuff

126
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,420
the first group we're going to talk

127
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,940
about today is Cloud Atlas hopefully a

128
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,160
lot of you guys already know about them

129
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,980
they're also known as Inception Blue

130
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,240
Coat put out a really good paper a

131
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,130
couple years ago about these guys so

132
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,780
just to go through real quick

133
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,150
we believe that Cloud Atlas is kind of a

134
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,920
spinoff from Red October prior to the

135
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,050
conflict if you will in Crimea we

136
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,240
noticed you know there was just Red

137
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,740
October that basically we were tracking

138
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,600
and what's can you hear me better that

139
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,640
way sorry guys

140
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:11,270
so anyway prior to the conflict in

141
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,350
Crimea

142
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,510
you know Red October existed as one

143
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,970
entity but then after all of that

144
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,010
started happening we saw this spin-off

145
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,770
show up and we called them Cloud Atlas

146
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,230
as well as others everybody believes

147
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,570
that their Eastern European base what's

148
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,460
really cool about them is they love to

149
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,720
really mess with IR teams researchers

150
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,280
they were pretty much one of the very

151
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,840
first ones that we found doing a lot of

152
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,280
these deception tactics and they're

153
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,950
actually active still today still doing

154
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,070
the things that they like to do and why

155
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,600
I like them I like to call them the

156
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,419
turducken of apt it's kind of like you

157
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:48,830
know something inside of something

158
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,479
inside of something hence the inception

159
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,600
name that they came up with as well so

160
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,010
we started looking at them and one of

161
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,190
the very early documents that we had was

162
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,460
actually rushing content and but the

163
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,840
metadata and the document was actually

164
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,120
showed that it was potentially created

165
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,520
on a Spanish system we started digging

166
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,440
into it and we started finding more and

167
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,020
more of this Spanish metadata attached

168
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,970
to a lot of these lore documents which

169
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,130
was kind of interesting so at first

170
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,510
we're like okay maybe these guys are

171
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,930
Spanish apt cool well then we started

172
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,419
finding mobile malware and the mobile

173
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:25,490
malware actually contained Arabic and

174
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,020
Hindi strings in it okay

175
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,129
we have a Arabic Spanish apt then what's

176
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:34,139
interesting is we found a string inside

177
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,960
of one of the malware's and and it said

178
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,090
god save the queen' what's cool about

179
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,340
that is they actually capitalize the

180
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,800
which I know a lot of us dumb Americans

181
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,389
don't tend to do that but if you're from

182
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:48,810
the UK you make sure you capitalize so

183
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,729
okay maybe we've got some sort of

184
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:53,340
British set then their infrastructure

185
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,870
was a bunch of home routers that were

186
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,030
actually popped in South Korea okay

187
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,699
where are they coming from now and at

188
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,979
one point which was really cool they

189
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:03,630
caught wind of researchers poking around

190
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,569
on the sea twos and running the malware

191
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:09,180
to try to solicit say a stage two and

192
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,759
instead of deploying their stage two

193
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,310
they actually deployed a pretty

194
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,800
well-known in Chinese piece of malware

195
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,690
to the researchers specifically victims

196
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,310
were getting one stage two which was the

197
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,289
real one and if you were a researcher

198
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:24,690
and they identified you or your box they

199
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,430
would deploy a Chinese piece of malware

200
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,520
instead so they knew what was up and

201
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,590
during compilation time they always made

202
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,509
it a point to actually reset their

203
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:36,360
clocks so there was really no good trend

204
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,099
analysis you could do on when the

205
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,349
malware was being compiled work hours

206
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:43,229
things like that so yeah it left us

207
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,800
basically in a major WTF moment and to

208
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,560
this day I think they're still doing a

209
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,090
lot of those tactics as well so keep

210
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,550
your eyes out for that so obviously

211
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,870
that's looking at strings and things

212
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,360
like you know very easily manipulated

213
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,370
and while Neutron is another case that

214
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,039
had something like that but it I much

215
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,449
prefer as an example of very different

216
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,699
manipulation tactics and and something

217
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:06,779
well entirely different a different

218
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:09,870
paradigm which is to say fine wild

219
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,360
Neutron samples included Romanian for

220
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,759
goodbye and translated or Russian for

221
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,560
success but I think that there's

222
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,759
something a lot more important here

223
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,009
which is to say a lot of people believe

224
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,830
that when it comes to apt in cyber

225
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,409
espionage because it tends to showcase

226
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:27,150
geopolitical events that are you know

227
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,319
happening in the world and are generally

228
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,120
public that if you're looking at the

229
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,250
tasking or the targeting then you can

230
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,380
more or less understand who the attacker

231
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,570
is so you know they're attacking these

232
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,948
sorts of people and there's a specific

233
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:39,779
country or organization that has a

234
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,089
problem with these types of people so

235
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:45,209
it must be country X or country Y and

236
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:46,680
this is something that tends to get put

237
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,889
in abt reports all over the place and

238
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:51,209
generally it's good thinking however

239
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:52,889
while Neutron is one of those cases

240
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:54,839
where we see that that paradigm breaks

241
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,459
down very easily with a certain type of

242
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,319
attacker and that is a mercenary

243
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:01,589
attacker so if you look at the victim

244
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:03,959
spread for a wild Neutron they hit law

245
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,850
firms they hit IT companies they were

246
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,379
very famous because they bagged a few

247
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:08,939
whales like Twitter and Apple and

248
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:10,889
Microsoft but they also went after

249
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:12,269
healthcare companies they went after

250
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,779
mergers and acquisitions companies

251
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:17,790
notably for an apt they didn't really

252
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,379
target any government or diplomatic

253
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:22,589
entities but they did do some

254
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:23,759
counterterrorism work they were

255
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,009
targeting radical Islamist forms so

256
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:31,379
there's no particular clear nexus of

257
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:33,059
what was driving well Neutron at least

258
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:35,370
no one Nexus but I think that this

259
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,749
suggests what's gonna happen when it

260
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:38,850
comes to mercenary groups that a lot of

261
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,259
the techniques that we tend to focus on

262
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:42,449
to be able to at least point at a

263
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,279
real-world situation start to break down

264
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,629
for us looking at another type of

265
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,490
deception tactic we also have the idea

266
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,370
of covering abt activities under the

267
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,889
guise of a lesser caliber actor so we're

268
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:57,749
gonna look at a really weak version of

269
00:09:57,749 --> 00:09:59,339
that one that never works and then we're

270
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:00,839
gonna look at a really strong version of

271
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,009
that that you know I think it's quite

272
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:03,839
popular these days so the weak version

273
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,029
of that is the Lazarus group these guys

274
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:07,410
are infamous and you know they're

275
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,389
related to the whole Sony attack and

276
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:10,470
we're at least quite a bit of research

277
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,959
on them recently but if you look at a

278
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,550
lot of the campaign's that were

279
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,740
attributed to the Lazarus actor every

280
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,509
one of them tends to come under the

281
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:20,790
guise of a hacktivist group that nobody

282
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,980
has ever heard of before has no pedigree

283
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,379
has no community attached to it and the

284
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:26,970
moment the attack is over they never

285
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,220
show up again so this is the weak

286
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,899
version of that you can say you know the

287
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,589
new romantic cyber army the who is group

288
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:36,870
the guardians of peace they come in for

289
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,389
the ransom note and then two days later

290
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,490
they've never been heard of again so of

291
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,139
course the media and everybody go after

292
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:48,389
the more likely culprit okay so that was

293
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:51,029
the weak version yeah now we're getting

294
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:53,009
into the cool stuff right so yeah we got

295
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:54,650
the big bad bear

296
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,190
also known as sofa capt 28 fancy bears

297
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,190
dancing penguins whatever but yeah it's

298
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,670
these guys so the cool part about these

299
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,620
guys obviously a lot of people believe

300
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,720
they're Russian based but again we don't

301
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,750
do attribution so but they have a ton of

302
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,580
zero days these guys are extremely well

303
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,730
resourced they've targeted everything

304
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,030
from domestic media to foreign media to

305
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,790
counterterrorism targets to dissidents

306
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,240
or activists within the country foreign

307
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,370
intelligence services they've pretty

308
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,950
much hit everybody which is really kind

309
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,850
of interesting because usually

310
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,220
government organizations if they're an

311
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,840
intelligence agency they usually have

312
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,300
certain slices of the pie that they tend

313
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,550
to stick with these guys don't really do

314
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,350
that they've got a huge amount of

315
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,300
infrastructure and again with the zero

316
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,750
days and different c-2 and servers and

317
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,520
things that they have they've got a ton

318
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,100
of money behind them the really cool

319
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,170
part about them is they love to just

320
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,970
jack with people all the time that's

321
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,820
like their mo currently before I get

322
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,830
into the three examples that we did I

323
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,750
just want to say that this stuff was

324
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,750
done back in February we had presented

325
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,880
this back at CANSEC West and at the time

326
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,880
it was kind of a really touchy subject a

327
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,980
lot of people were you know how do you

328
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,960
know that's them and and you know are

329
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,120
they really doing this and and now with

330
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,470
the recent events that have occurred

331
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,380
over the summer you know the DC leaks

332
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,310
the DNC stuff fancy bearish dotnet they

333
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,070
actually created at one point now it's

334
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,290
almost become commonplace and you know

335
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,180
the media picked up on it everybody

336
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,650
talks about it and now it's just a

337
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,020
normal thing to accept which is kind of

338
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,610
interesting so we're gonna present the

339
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,910
older stuff before the summer things

340
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,470
happen but just keep that in mind when

341
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,540
I'm going through it interesting caveat

342
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,910
to be able to look at it as a trend so

343
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,380
for a lot of people was a kind of a

344
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,060
surprising idea that they would do some

345
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,020
of the things that happen over the

346
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,600
summer for us we'd like to at least show

347
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,700
what you know they were already doing in

348
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,590
this space so that you can understand it

349
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,300
more of as a linear build-up in their

350
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,690
tactics so the first one is Ukraine

351
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:07,640
so basically enter cyber baku so

352
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,970
I guess 2015 the leader of Ukraine and

353
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,910
Yanukovych got Elstad fled to southern

354
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,590
Russia he's believed to be an exile

355
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,990
there and around the same time the

356
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,690
Parliament disbanded the coup the

357
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,390
secretive police for him right after

358
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,280
that happens cyber baku popped up on

359
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,560
stage now before this happened

360
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,630
there's no again as one kind of alluded

361
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,980
to earlier there's really no pedigree

362
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,990
here most of the people that were

363
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,330
involved either were completely unknown

364
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,160
or there was just really nothing there

365
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,190
to show where they came from

366
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,510
I'll skip through some of this stuff to

367
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,450
get this bed up so yeah they started

368
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,440
basically hitting Ukraine and their sole

369
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,150
purpose was basically just to mess with

370
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,460
the masses they were going through they

371
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,100
targeted NATO at first they actually hit

372
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,500
some election systems they hack some

373
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,290
billboards and broadcast propaganda they

374
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,940
hit the government directly blocked cell

375
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,160
phone calls dumped a bunch of emails

376
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,530
from the government out there anything

377
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,840
they could do to cause essentially

378
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,410
unrest distrust in the public to kind of

379
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,610
further the I guess the agenda of what

380
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,890
you could consider was Russia now why

381
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,440
would somebody be doing this obviously

382
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,390
it's plausible deniability right you

383
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,820
don't want to have a team that everyone

384
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,440
pretty much attributes to Russian

385
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,020
intelligence to be pegged with doing

386
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,930
this type of thing back when this was

387
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,000
going on again it was in common place it

388
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,550
wasn't widely accepted so standing up a

389
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,590
front to do kind of your dirty work your

390
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,700
laundry that you don't want to be

391
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,460
exposed as is essentially why this

392
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,450
happened so moving on from that the u.s.

393
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,190
NATO they got a little ticked off about

394
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,810
certain things that were happening and

395
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,280
we started threatening sanctions and

396
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,230
other stuff against Russia well right

397
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,120
around the same time cyber Caliphate

398
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,460
came on board if anybody's familiar with

399
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,040
these guys they were essentially I guess

400
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,320
the anonymous arm of Isis supposedly so

401
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,910
they came on the same thing there was no

402
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,040
history there's no pedigree associated

403
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,110
with these guys and they hit what's

404
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,430
really interesting I thought it was kind

405
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,740
of comical they hit centcom's Twitter

406
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,200
account and also Newsweek and they

407
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,490
broadcast the picture at the bottom

408
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,340
there

409
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,870
that's a screenshot from one of the

410
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,840
Twitter accounts but basically you know

411
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,810
if you log in and you follow CENTCOM on

412
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,970
Twitter and all of a sudden you see Isis

413
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,710
propaganda coming across that's kind of

414
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,930
messed up right so they started with

415
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,150
that then they started hitting some

416
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,800
media outlets they actually hit some

417
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,100
stuff out in Albuquerque I believe and

418
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,480
then what was interesting is they hit

419
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,150
some media outlets in Baltimore and in

420
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,790
Maryland and actually got a hold of the

421
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,360
text alerting system and they started

422
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,279
texting people that subscribe to those

423
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,370
news agencies with Isis propaganda so

424
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,930
you've got Joe Schmo sitting in his

425
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,670
basement you know over on the Eastern

426
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,290
Shore of Maryland and he gets a magical

427
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,089
text from the local news station saying

428
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:05,279
Isis is coming to get you it's kind of

429
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,040
messed up then they also they're more

430
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,930
famous one was they hit TV five in

431
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,460
France and they were actually able to

432
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,370
black out the channels I think it was

433
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,930
like eleven channels nationwide or

434
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,070
something that they were able to black

435
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,080
out and ultimately prob broadcasting

436
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,450
propaganda across to so all of this

437
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,800
stuff if you're interested in how this

438
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,589
is tied to sofa see again refer to the

439
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:27,900
paper there's definitely some things you

440
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:33,390
could latch onto there so moving on then

441
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,950
in 2015 later on about four months later

442
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,460
Sally started conducting bombing raids

443
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,370
and runs into Yemen because of an

444
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,830
uprising that was occurring and again

445
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,589
another group pops up no pedigree before

446
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:53,370
and it's the Yemen cyber army or YCA so

447
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,080
they showed up a lot of people

448
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,450
immediately jumped on board and they

449
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,339
started saying well this is Iran this is

450
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:02,520
totally Iran we were one of those I

451
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,490
still am kind of but as we started

452
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,470
looking a little more they started off

453
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,670
they hit the london-based

454
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,760
Al Hayat newspaper and then what was

455
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,280
more important was they ended up dumping

456
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,709
a ton of data from Saudi Ministry of

457
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:18,569
Foreign Affairs what's interesting about

458
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:22,020
this is back in February two months

459
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,270
prior we actually knew that sofa C was

460
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,770
on Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs

461
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,290
networks already there was an embassy in

462
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,650
Ukraine that was actually hit and

463
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,280
we suspect that sofas he had pulled or

464
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,500
taken all this data off of the

465
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,650
ministry's networks and then saw kind of

466
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,750
an opening or an opportunity to go ahead

467
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,000
and conduct another you know smear

468
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,410
tactic against a country that

469
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,210
essentially is one of their enemies at

470
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,570
this point and again the TTP's follow

471
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,240
the same type of thing as the last two

472
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,580
on top of that there's actually some

473
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,990
infrastructure that is linked to the

474
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,780
early registration of their domains and

475
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,250
again refer to the paper if you really

476
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,530
need to look at all that stuff alright

477
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,960
so let's move beyond the idea of pegging

478
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,470
the blame on a lesser group instead to

479
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,020
the idea of an apt trying to put the

480
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,420
blame on another apt group since these

481
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,740
are becoming so well known throughout

482
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,480
occur become so well known it might

483
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,130
actually be easier to say you know what

484
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,880
it wasn't Dooku but rather it's apt one

485
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,780
and that's what's happening with this

486
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,190
example which I'm just gonna have to

487
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,270
blaze through because we don't have a

488
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,950
great deal of time but as some of you

489
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,650
know the the do q2 samples at least a

490
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:36,120
64-bit kernel driver I believe included

491
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,590
the ugly gorilla handle which is Wang

492
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,170
dongs handle it's kind of patently

493
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,150
ridiculous to consider that that's who

494
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,450
was behind Dooku too but it is at least

495
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,940
a nice tactic to divert an IR team that

496
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,380
might have no greater context and just

497
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,390
to Google some strings the better

498
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,800
version of that is something that we

499
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,440
call Tiger milk and this is a

500
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,190
unpublished bit of research it was

501
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,500
pushed out to our private subscribers

502
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,870
last year and what's interesting about

503
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,730
Tiger milk is it's a well it's a

504
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,990
targeted attack against a specific

505
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,850
country was active for about six months

506
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,360
it was going after Peru military

507
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,070
organizations and and certain government

508
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,460
organizations and what's it's the

509
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,400
malware isn't great it's doing memory

510
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,530
rejection and it's clunky it would have

511
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,720
caused some errors in the system but

512
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,460
every single one of the backdoors and

513
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,570
every one every single one of the

514
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,100
components was signed with this

515
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,390
certificate and I don't know of anybody

516
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,980
in the crowd might recognize what the

517
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,590
certificate is you can yell it out but

518
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,240
this is the same certificate I was was

519
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,010
used in Stuxnet a and B and this is the

520
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,380
realtek certificate that was presumably

521
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,610
stolen and used for these first two

522
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,440
samples and as a lot of you probably

523
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,260
know this was invalidated and has has

524
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:43,640
been

525
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,179
for years so signing those samples with

526
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:48,920
the certificate serves no practical

527
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,200
value as far as the attack phase goes

528
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,080
older than hopefully from the attackers

529
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,150
perspective to mislead investigators

530
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,710
into thinking that it's the same

531
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,160
infamous well-known team so I guess the

532
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,630
real question behind Tiger milk is how

533
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,929
the hell did they get the certificate

534
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:06,890
alright so the last one what kind of

535
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,020
blazed through because of time but it

536
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,059
sturla hopefully everybody's kind of

537
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:12,710
familiar with these guys also believed

538
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,860
to be Russian and I really like them

539
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,960
I've spent a lot of time looking at

540
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,090
these guys people have been traced back

541
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,210
to around 1997 potentially involved with

542
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,799
moonlight maze if you want to read more

543
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,010
refer to Thomas Ford's book but what's

544
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,330
really cool about these guys is their

545
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,070
OPSEC is pretty awesome

546
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,710
they're pretty in tune with the victims

547
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,059
they watch the victim boxes and they

548
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:36,290
make sure that they're not being watched

549
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,440
by say IR team or researchers of some

550
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,770
sort there's a specific incident that

551
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,299
I'd like to talk about that we talk we

552
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:46,610
call and call faking dragon maybe a few

553
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,799
of you have heard it before but

554
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:49,700
essentially what happened was there's

555
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,220
this extremely important victim that had

556
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,120
been compromised

557
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,460
and they figured it out they called in

558
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,200
their IR team and the IR team started

559
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,150
watching this system well at the same

560
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,730
time they ran some tools and it seems

561
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,860
like Turla picked up on it and what

562
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,179
happened was is they had originally

563
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:06,710
deployed whit bot which is their stage

564
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,890
one and the IR team is kind of sitting

565
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,200
back and waiting to see the stage two

566
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,570
but instead of pushing the big bad snake

567
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,270
which everybody was expecting they ended

568
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,370
up pushing Corian which at the time was

569
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,740
actually a very rare lesser-known

570
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,490
Chinese based apt or piece of malware so

571
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,470
you know obviously what the hell well at

572
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,179
the time like I said it wasn't known

573
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:32,030
what Quarian was so what essentially

574
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,250
happened was it sent these researchers

575
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,040
down a really deep rabbit hole and while

576
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,780
that was happening oh this is the

577
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,190
infrastructure by the way it all pointed

578
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,500
back to Beijing and it's believed that

579
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,760
the infrastructure wasn't even

580
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,650
controlled by Turla it was just

581
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,570
basically to send the researchers off on

582
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,850
the side but it was pretty cool because

583
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,710
while the researchers were looking down

584
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,059
this rabbit hole and trying to figure

585
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:55,220
out what is this malware and eventually

586
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,720
came to the conclusion that it's

587
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,630
based Turla had used that to their

588
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,220
advantage and actually backed out all of

589
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,560
their other stuff so they left no trace

590
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,450
and they were gone but it's a pretty

591
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,090
interesting you know example of how

592
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,860
people do watch victim boxes they do

593
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,050
watch who calls back to their c2 servers

594
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:15,260
and they'll react to that other theories

595
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,120
obviously Turrell is Chinese maybe

596
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,980
they're working with China but no I

597
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,720
don't think so so okay real quick this

598
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,730
is the important part of the talk and it

599
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,550
looks like we have a few minutes so why

600
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,650
we're talking about this in general the

601
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,240
first thing we need to do is kind of

602
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,670
address the level of attribution that

603
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,560
happens in products out there and I'd

604
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,850
like to break it down into basically

605
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,470
three different groups if your

606
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,210
government if your private sector and

607
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,440
believe it or not the media actually

608
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,420
plays a really important role here so

609
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,010
it's basically what level do you need

610
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,630
well as the government if you're going

611
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,330
to be leveraging sanctions or de marshes

612
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,250
or conducting cyber operations back at

613
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,170
another country you really need to have

614
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,810
that level of fidelity right you have to

615
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,880
go as deep as what unit was involved you

616
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,860
know in it down to individuals if you

617
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,160
want to you know basically issue wanted

618
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,920
posters for five three PLA members you

619
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,940
need that kind of level and moving on

620
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,310
for the private sector unfortunately we

621
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,540
all like to have the individual

622
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,250
attribution we all like to write papers

623
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,230
that show pictures of people walking

624
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,660
around with their children but that's

625
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,580
really not needed and I think it's a

626
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,790
little irresponsible but if you look at

627
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,160
it what you need is you need attribution

628
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,470
kind of directed towards where your

629
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,240
resources are right so if you're doing

630
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,430
business in China and you don't you're

631
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,200
not doing business in South America you

632
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,970
probably just need the level of

633
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,680
attribution as to where this you know

634
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,430
the country of origin basically so you

635
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,170
can kind of redirect your resources and

636
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,180
focus on where it needs to be the more

637
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,890
important portion here is the media so a

638
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,380
lot of times when the media catches one

639
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,330
of a story referred to the summer

640
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,240
incidents you know they want any level

641
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,700
the first thing they ask for is whodunit

642
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,930
right I want to know who's responsible

643
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,910
who's behind the attacks show me a

644
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,030
picture where do they live whatever

645
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,380
unfortunately at the same time they

646
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,960
don't tend to ask why a lot of times

647
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,610
we've

648
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,539
journalists kind of come and ask this

649
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:12,649
question but then they don't question

650
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:13,940
why you actually attribute it to

651
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,220
something so I'd like you know to think

652
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,539
for people to think about that in the

653
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,679
future

654
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:20,360
you know question the researchers and

655
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,649
ask them exactly why they're attributing

656
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:24,100
things

657
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,600
similarly we you know we'd like to be

658
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,860
able to leave people with some

659
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,779
conclusions and takeaways and at least

660
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:31,100
shape some of the conversation that we

661
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,019
hope starts up around this and I want to

662
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:35,000
run through it quickly so that we might

663
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,049
actually have time for questions but

664
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:38,240
essentially it's becoming more and more

665
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,590
important for us to be able to define

666
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,299
what the value of threat intelligence is

667
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:42,950
and what the contribution is and I think

668
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,269
one of the really important parts and

669
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:45,860
that is to be able to differentiate it

670
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,850
from what IIT and IR are providing I

671
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,279
think that the main thing that threat

672
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:53,809
intelligence provides is actually

673
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:57,759
historical context it's the one main

674
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:00,710
feed of data or at least the one main

675
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,059
feature that you actually need to be

676
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:04,399
able to differentiate in the past cases

677
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:05,840
that we were just discussing whether

678
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,250
you're being you know having your your

679
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,200
chain yanked or if you actually are

680
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,360
looking at the team that you should be

681
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,610
looking at at the same time I think that

682
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,870
we need to have some conversations about

683
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,960
who can actually do attribution and

684
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,490
presumably since most of the people here

685
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,769
anti-malware researchers or working with

686
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:23,539
endpoint companies and so on the truth

687
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:25,159
is that we're not the right people to do

688
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:26,750
attribution we're not in a position to

689
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,389
actually do attribution if the measure

690
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:31,279
of solid attribution or ultimate

691
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,539
fidelity is gonna be something like a

692
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:36,440
pea cap then the people best suited to

693
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,789
be doing attribution are probably the

694
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:39,350
second agencies the gods on the wires

695
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,820
that you know get to see so many of

696
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,250
these things and sadly that's where you

697
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,350
get into kind of a Greek myth Cassandra

698
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,139
type of situation where the institutions

699
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:49,610
that are best positioned to see

700
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,590
everything are also the ones that won't

701
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,659
be believed because when we see some of

702
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:55,759
these major attacks these stories start

703
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,649
to conveniently leak saying well the I

704
00:25:57,649 --> 00:25:59,750
see the intelligence community is

705
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,850
suggesting that it's you know North

706
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,429
Korea or so on and everybody goes well

707
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,779
if you can't substantiate your case we

708
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:07,340
don't care for it so there's a bit of a

709
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,450
trade-off there lastly there's some

710
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,299
takeaways here and you know if you take

711
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:15,830
anything out of this presentation it's

712
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,330
these last three or four questions

713
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:20,019
things to ask yourself if you do produce

714
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:22,370
threat intelligence or do at

715
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,520
in any way so the first one is basically

716
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,289
you know a lot of companies like to talk

717
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:29,929
about hacking back you know are you

718
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:31,909
willing to really stick your neck out

719
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:34,279
and offer a service like that or do

720
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:36,799
something like that when we've just

721
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,240
shown that there's just a few examples

722
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,210
and there's tons more of instances where

723
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,950
attribution is it's really really muddy

724
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,890
a lot of times you're never gonna get a

725
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,809
hundred percent and in cases like this

726
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:50,240
you know people really need a second

727
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,730
guess before they start reacting to

728
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,049
things just based on what a few

729
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:58,130
researchers say again the level of

730
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,230
attribution when you're doing this try

731
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,149
if you're a consumer especially try to

732
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:04,010
think about you know what level do I

733
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,899
really need don't pressure people into

734
00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:09,289
trying to say this is you know gru right

735
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:11,690
if you can say it's Russian based or

736
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,909
Eastern European or it follows you know

737
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:16,190
their methods or things like that that's

738
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,470
really what you need and to go along

739
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,470
with that you know even it's just the

740
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,149
clustering of activity the group names

741
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:24,740
for example do you really need to know

742
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,799
if you're a bank that you know it's

743
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:30,380
three PLA or a specific unit or do you

744
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,940
need to know that it's a PT one and

745
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,960
understand the TTP's of a PT one kind of

746
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,190
a question to think about if you're in

747
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,049
the government obviously different story

748
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:42,559
but for the majority of us here you know

749
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,450
just keeping it within groups is

750
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,899
probably sufficient and lastly if you're

751
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,970
a producer of threat intelligence and

752
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,740
you're out there writing reports like

753
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,870
this you're trying to do attribution

754
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:56,210
think about what actionable intelligence

755
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,890
you're actually putting in your report

756
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,309
are you writing a 20 page blog or report

757
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:03,799
on you know an actor and putting lots of

758
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,720
sexy pictures in and talking about who

759
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,700
they are but in reality at the end of

760
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,289
the day there's nothing in that paper

761
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:11,750
that a consumer would be able to take

762
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,090
and use to you know defend on their

763
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,070
networks or to understand the the actor

764
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,799
a little bit better super important just

765
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,210
think about it make sure you put IO

766
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,279
seasoned make sure you you know

767
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,809
substantiate your claims if you are

768
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:26,390
gonna do any sort of attribution so that

769
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,130
was kind of a whirlwind tour of what's

770
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:30,260
covered and was kind of a 20-page paper

771
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,000
I think it was condensed down to like 10

772
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,500
or 11 you know I'd like to kind of run

773
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,570
if you read my paper from last year I

774
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,100
hope that people find that interesting

775
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,600
and and that it's the beginning of a

776
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,770
conversation a little bit more

777
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,659
high-level about some of these issues

778
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:43,890
that we're facing and why they're

779
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,360
particularly important as I'm sure a lot

780
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,280
of you have latched on to over the past

781
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,289
few months with what's going on with

782
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:51,750
some of our sofa C friends I don't know

783
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,070
if we have time for questions it would

784
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,320
be great if we could if not you know

785
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,100
we'll be more than happy to one quick

786
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,720
question

787
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,070
there's someone into the closing keynote

788
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:05,130
in the front I mean this is actually a

789
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,799
Christian not around but know I love I

790
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:09,690
love to talk and I think this a lot we

791
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,250
can chat about at the bar afterwards but

792
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,230
I guess the question I have is with the

793
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:16,980
attribution thing how much of how much

794
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,470
of this is our own fault that we end up

795
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:22,470
feeling pressured to do attribution like

796
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,059
I kind of feel this is a bit of our own

797
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:26,340
making so it's wondering if you yeah so

798
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,990
I and this is something that I touched

799
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,000
upon with the last paper and and I tried

800
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,710
not to go into so much in this one but I

801
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,210
think it has to do with the structure of

802
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,320
the industry and where we're at right

803
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,150
now and that what value were getting

804
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,340
back from threat intelligence while

805
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,750
organizations are still trying to figure

806
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,520
out why they need us and what they can

807
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,559
benefit from from getting our products

808
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:46,049
and so on in the meantime the great

809
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:47,130
value of threat intelligence for

810
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,710
companies is PR and it's hard to really

811
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,750
continue to convince journalists that

812
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,950
they should be writing about all this

813
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,840
super cool stuff if you don't come to

814
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,850
them and say hey here's this real world

815
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:59,490
geopolitical situation where that a lot

816
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,750
of people are interested in for you to

817
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,190
write about so you end up getting

818
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,720
cornered and saying you know this person

819
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,860
doesn't really give a damn about what

820
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,299
kind of memory injection they're using

821
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:07,830
they want to hear that it was you know

822
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,240
this country in this organization

823
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,460
perpetrating this horrendous act so

824
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,590
until the value of thought intelligence

825
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,409
becomes more clear in a corporate sense

826
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:18,780
in a consumable sense or even in a

827
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,820
public value sense and it's not about

828
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,830
the sexy whodunit we're kind of screwed

829
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,770
into that situation thank you very much

830
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,780
for that please show your appreciation

831
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,179
I'm sure these guys will gladly answer

832
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:33,830
questions on the bar later
