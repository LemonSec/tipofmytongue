1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:06,569
okay welcome to the second session of

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,130
this recession piece welcome to jean ian

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,889
and anton from ESET who will now talk to

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,900
you about the modern attacks against

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,550
russian financial institutions excellent

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,119
so hi everyone so my name is jean butta

7
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,880
I'm am our researcher a tea set and

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,949
together with my colleague and 10 sharp

9
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,279
enough we will discuss on the tax that

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,370
we've seen that we researched that were

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,530
mounted against Russian financial

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,739
institution and we've been researching

13
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,390
malware that six financial gain for

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,879
several years and we've seen this big

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,610
shift towards financial institutions and

16
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,980
this is what we wanted to talk about and

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,960
we had the same problems that Peter had

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,199
with this shifting landscape I would say

19
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,500
where what we thought was mostly

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,359
regional that we were predicting that it

21
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,550
would go to other regions of the world

22
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,290
well it actually happened this doesn't

23
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,650
16 then with big news so we will look at

24
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,630
that after that at the end of the

25
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,930
presentation so a couple of years ago we

26
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,490
started seeing all these different add

27
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,000
lines so here you see hackers using

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,490
malware to steal money from financial

29
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,040
institution in in Russia then we have

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,000
attacks that were against ATM so Young's

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,799
of people that were just standing near

32
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,990
any TM and without even touching it were

33
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,700
able to collect money because someone

34
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,100
else was using malware to automatically

35
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,250
dispense cash and another attack we've

36
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,280
seen as manipulation of the exchange

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,829
rate of rubble and actually antenna will

38
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,570
give you a lot more details about the

39
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,990
specific attack which is pretty dramatic

40
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,979
and the another type of attack was done

41
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,140
by this game so core core metal which is

42
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,850
a rollback attack they were able to

43
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,130
control a processing card system and

44
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,070
using this control we were able to go

45
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,090
withdraw some money and then do

46
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,769
back on the transaction so they could do

47
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:10,598
it again over and over and over and they

48
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,550
were able to actually get to get a lot

49
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,620
of money out of this so again very

50
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,480
sophisticated attacks and finally you

51
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,870
have gangs that targeted wide array of

52
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,459
financial institutions in Russia and

53
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:24,489
were able to gain a lot of a lot of

54
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:26,950
money out of it so it seemed at this

55
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,750
point that we were seeing more and more

56
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,150
financial institutions being targeted by

57
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,519
these guys and it seemed like especially

58
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,140
in Russia and neighboring countries this

59
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,810
is something that we were seeing and it

60
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,140
was becoming commonplace easy clean so

61
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,049
one might wonder which group of people

62
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:46,209
actually has the capacity to mount this

63
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,890
type of attack because they have to know

64
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,489
very specialized tools that these banks

65
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:53,530
are using and how the workers are the

66
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,230
banks are operating so I will showcase

67
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,299
some of these groups here of course this

68
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:00,459
is not a extensive because there are

69
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:01,810
other groups that we did not research

70
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,579
but these are the ones for which we have

71
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:05,860
a good visibility so the first one is a

72
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,530
boot trap so this is a group that

73
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,440
started their activities around 2014 and

74
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,510
we actually published a blog post about

75
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,930
them last April in 2015 and we actually

76
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,030
coined the name so for better or worse

77
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,049
and this is our creation I would say so

78
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:24,880
at the very beginning they were mostly

79
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,489
targeting businesses in Russia so they

80
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:29,470
were going after mostly accounting

81
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,639
departments trying to compromise systems

82
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,590
from which they could do and some wire

83
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,630
transfers and then after what we've seen

84
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,239
them shift the focus so instead of

85
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,829
targeting businesses they were going

86
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,690
after financial institutions themselves

87
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,910
and it was quite easy to see it in fact

88
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,239
because in the under targeted attacks

89
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:50,950
they were using decoy documents and as

90
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,900
soon as they started targeting financial

91
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,489
institutions could see this big shift in

92
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:55,780
the decoy documents where they were

93
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,019
using documents coming out of Central

94
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:01,299
Bank of Russia let's say or take

95
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:02,950
explaining different laws that were

96
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,989
governing the financial institution and

97
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:06,760
there was a very good report written by

98
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,049
group I be that did forensic

99
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,130
investigations on them and they were

100
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,500
able to tell that between Augusta's and

101
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,548
15 enable of 2016 these guys stole more

102
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:21,579
than 25 us more than 25 million u.s.

103
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,470
dollars which is like quite a big amount

104
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,380
right and the second group that you'll

105
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,240
probably already heard of is a Cal

106
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,670
mannequin and neck group so these were

107
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,310
profiled by two very important reports

108
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,320
one by kaspersky and one by fox IT

109
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,360
andrew pi b and these guys have been

110
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,270
around from 2013 and I've been targeted

111
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,030
a lot the Russian financial institutions

112
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,220
doing the ATM acts that I explained

113
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,250
briefly in the first few slides using

114
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,040
malware to actually automatically making

115
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,890
an ATM dispense cash so this is a very

116
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,650
sophisticated group as well and finally

117
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,190
the last group is cork oh so this group

118
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,740
appeared in 2014 and they are they

119
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,090
actually have their own but net so

120
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,610
corker is the name of the malware and we

121
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,510
published a blog post in 2014 about this

122
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,220
piece of malware but we didn't know at

123
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,260
the time that it was used for such

124
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,060
attacks and these guys have mounted

125
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,590
pretty pretty like attacks that were

126
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,720
very effective and they were

127
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,400
extraordinary I would say so there was

128
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,380
one from the rollback attack so the ones

129
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,030
I discussed with previously where they

130
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,040
had come place that were able to roll

131
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,260
back the transactions from ATM but they

132
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,750
were also able to modify the exchange

133
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,390
rate of the rubble against the US

134
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,280
dollars and this is what Anton will have

135
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,810
discussed a bit later arm so of course

136
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,090
you see that these guys have the nest

137
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,060
sea workforce to interact with systems

138
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,190
that are not publicly available so this

139
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,890
is really a sign of the specialization

140
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,310
of this group so if we take a quick look

141
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,880
at the similarities all these groups we

142
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,990
believe are different so they're using

143
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,229
the different type of malware but they

144
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,320
share some similarities so in terms of

145
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,180
specialization this is a truly recurrent

146
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,979
team because like to be able to mount

147
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:11,169
this type of attack Yuri have to have

148
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:13,270
skilled people with you skilled

149
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,669
criminals and the organization is quite

150
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:18,130
similar as well where you see different

151
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,670
developers having

152
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,830
responsibility for different modules and

153
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,730
their modus operandi is quite similar as

154
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,180
well where it's very similar to apt

155
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,880
groups so they will try to target

156
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,280
specific people and then try to do

157
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,980
lateral movements to the behavioral

158
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,810
study trying to learn more about the

159
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,400
environment and really compromise a

160
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,100
specific systems they're all going for

161
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,170
low hanging fruits so even though they

162
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,020
are targeting this financial institution

163
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,990
they are trying to go after systems that

164
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,820
lack some authentication let's say or

165
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,370
that should be isolated but are not so

166
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,740
they are really going for the low any

167
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,530
fruits in these institutions they also

168
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,300
share some technical similarity so they

169
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,220
have access to tools that are not widely

170
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,380
available so here one example is the

171
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,630
nearest exploit kit so this exploit kit

172
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,710
is available to only a few and we know

173
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,470
that boo travancore Co both were able to

174
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,390
distribute or malware through an

175
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,830
interest exploit kit which shows that

176
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,540
they have similar links in the

177
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,020
underground they were also using some

178
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,460
compromised websites I wish that were

179
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,410
the same between the two groups they

180
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,020
were also using macro for intruder which

181
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,600
is a kit that is able to build a

182
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,520
Microsoft Word exploiting different

183
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,840
vulnerabilities and they only had very

184
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,130
big in the only a few people had access

185
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,770
to it and these groups had they are also

186
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,470
using encryption to protect the most

187
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,140
important part of their of their tools

188
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,420
so when they and when they compromised

189
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,190
the system they will go and they will if

190
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,020
it's very interesting they will install

191
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,650
new specialized tool and usually custom

192
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,150
tools for the victims and they don't

193
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,970
want this to be easily analyzed so they

194
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,340
will try to encrypt it using a system

195
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,890
specific key so in terms in the case of

196
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,210
glue trap and cork oh they were using

197
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,140
the hard drive serial number as a key so

198
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,490
if you're doing forensic evidence and

199
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,990
you don't have access to the system then

200
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,330
of course it becomes very different very

201
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,310
difficult to do it and they're using a

202
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,290
lot of the shelf to as well to make it

203
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,680
more difficult to track them so a lot of

204
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,230
remote and schrader based tool

205
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,320
Mimmi cats pen touch two tools like this

206
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,809
and this is something I want to show you

207
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:36,830
so here you can see pdb path so there

208
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,479
are different developers you can see it

209
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,150
by the different coding style at these

210
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,220
guys use and here you can see a pdb path

211
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,410
that comes in several different tools

212
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,570
that several groups were actually using

213
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,910
so this is interesting because it kind

214
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,070
of ties them together so here you can

215
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,990
see that it's a local privilege exploit

216
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,660
that followed the mere underscore aid

217
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,580
not to probably not his real name or

218
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,420
maybe it is but this is one to erode

219
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,820
another tool we found is this one BHO

220
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,160
stands for browser helper object so this

221
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,550
is a plug-in for internet explorer and

222
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,230
the interesting thing in that case is

223
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,360
that they were abusing well they

224
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,540
repurpose a very well-known plug-in by

225
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,150
eff HTTPS Everywhere so some of you

226
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,670
might be aware of this plug-in where if

227
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,700
there is an issue TPS version of a site

228
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,160
available it will automatically redirect

229
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,250
you to a URL well they actually used

230
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,580
that too and maybe your victims go to

231
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,380
the two differentials at they intended

232
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,590
to and they it was also a bundling mini

233
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,450
cats so many cats is a very popular tool

234
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,350
in and been testing and cyber criminals

235
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,510
are using it quite a lot and it was

236
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,130
packing the resources and dropped on the

237
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,720
system and what it does is that it

238
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,510
simply execute two simple commands so it

239
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,120
gains debug privileges and then we'll

240
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,680
try to straight memory for log on

241
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,480
passwords so if some of you are not

242
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,870
aware of any cats what it does is one of

243
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,520
its functionality is actually able to

244
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,920
recover passwords from memory so then

245
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,170
you can reuse these these account

246
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,760
credentials to try to do some lateral

247
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,710
movement so these are the groups that we

248
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,180
described in the paper and that we know

249
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,010
are still active of course one notable

250
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,970
group that we did not profile is the

251
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,680
Lord group so they were arrested a

252
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,020
couple of weeks ago and they had also a

253
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,740
capacity to buy to build

254
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,279
these attacks so in terms of TTP's it's

255
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,350
very similar to target two more regular

256
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,480
targeted attacks that we see from apt

257
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,990
groups so they will first try to find

258
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,600
target selection then send a spear

259
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,490
phishing email usually with an

260
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,070
attachment if the guy double clicks then

261
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,350
system is compromised they most of them

262
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,200
have automatic tools to assess the value

263
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,270
of a specific system so they will try to

264
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,820
find a specific URLs or access on the

265
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,790
computer or processes are running on a

266
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,890
computer to know if they will be

267
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,709
actually able to monetize this system

268
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:09,630
and there are the groups most of them

269
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,050
are using two types so very targeted

270
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,700
sending spear phishing email let's say

271
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,550
like this one so this is an example of a

272
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,089
spear phishing email that was sent to a

273
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:23,070
bank employee in Russia and this guy was

274
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,690
actually the Swift administrator of his

275
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,230
bank and he received this email and we

276
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,690
know that these guys are after these

277
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,370
type of system because once you get

278
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,010
access to a computer that is able to

279
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,339
make swift transfers of course it's

280
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:39,690
obvious that they are trying to abuse

281
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,320
such systems other groups are using more

282
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,910
of a shotgun approach so I really told

283
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,010
you that Kirko grows their own but net

284
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,370
and they then terrific the interesting

285
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,370
systems out of it here what you see is a

286
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,800
viet minh website so if some of you

287
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,529
don't know this software it's basically

288
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:00,510
a remote administrator software so it

289
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,060
allows you to remotely control a

290
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,860
computer and this is a tool that is used

291
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,589
by almost all these groups because when

292
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:09,480
a system is compromising and then login

293
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,930
and try to to see what's on the system

294
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,089
in an install additional tool and this

295
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:17,310
particular website we discovered last

296
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,620
year that it was distributing malware

297
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,240
but not only was a distributing malware

298
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,589
but it was distributing bootstrap as

299
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:25,890
well as the lurk downloader and of

300
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,170
course not all people that will download

301
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,440
this this bundle is actually good target

302
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,540
for them so they will have to cherry

303
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,190
pick the ones are the most valuable but

304
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,380
still it shows you the moral a shotgun a

305
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,000
pro

306
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,300
and these groups once they're in what

307
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,460
they will try to do is really try to

308
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,010
find the most valuable computers so we

309
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,990
see them trying to do lateral movement

310
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,660
try to get access to these systems that

311
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,910
will allow them to make the transfer lap

312
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,850
and or a system that will allow them to

313
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,890
make financial gain well I find really

314
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,300
interesting is that most of these guys

315
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,060
will lurk in the network for extensive

316
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,820
period of time and it will install tools

317
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,120
that will allow them to know better the

318
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,290
behavior of the victim so they will try

319
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,450
to see when he's working to have his

320
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,920
work a bit when he goes to lunch and

321
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,960
this is something that the cocoa group

322
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,240
has abused during this ruble exchange

323
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,090
rate manipulation and they will also

324
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,270
have systems well know where to take

325
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,580
screenshots or videos because they

326
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,190
usually have to interact with a piece of

327
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,410
software is not available to the general

328
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,570
public so some of them will have to

329
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,940
learn how to use it through these tools

330
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,370
and finally they try to compromise in

331
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,690
the project system so what I mean by

332
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,120
this is they're usually trying to go

333
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,770
against the domain controllers to issue

334
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,110
passwords and then do a draw movement

335
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,270
but also mail servers so we know the

336
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,160
case where these groups was monitoring

337
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,350
especially the a emails coming out of

338
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,500
the IT department trying to see if they

339
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,270
were if they were able to discover a

340
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,580
breach and how they actually respond to

341
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,410
this so of course this gives us this

342
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,180
gives them a lot of information about

343
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,450
how the the company is reacting and it

344
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,330
helped them and once they're done they

345
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,430
usually clean their traces so what they

346
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,810
will do they will destroy evidence it

347
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,880
will destroy files registry keys some of

348
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,280
them will even go and override the MBR

349
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,930
so what you see here is an incest packed

350
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,210
malware that will only override the MBR

351
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,310
so this specific tool was used by the

352
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,560
boot tribe brew but Coco is also using

353
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,360
it in other groups as well to try to

354
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,220
wipe as much as possible the evidence

355
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,370
and actually the boot group is going one

356
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:40,880
step further and will show this to the

357
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,500
user which most of you I guess can't

358
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,290
read but what it says is that the

359
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,180
computer at some auto a problem and that

360
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,860
the user you must reboot the system so

361
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,310
of course if it does that

362
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,500
and what happens the computer won't

363
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,290
restart because MBR is overwritten and

364
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,200
the most likely reaction will be to take

365
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,210
the system to the IT department which

366
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,340
might reimage the old machine what you

367
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,900
get is nothing for forensic

368
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,160
investigation so targeted system so we

369
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,940
already saw ATM hack we will talk about

370
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,100
the exchange rate but they are going

371
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,710
after other type of software as well so

372
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,810
this is a remote banking software this

373
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,839
one is from my bank I've been to

374
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,600
software and these are used by banks

375
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,240
customer to make all sort of banking

376
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,460
operation and we know that these systems

377
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,500
are very interested that these groups

378
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,210
are interested by this system because

379
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,000
the initial dropper will list all the

380
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,950
processes that are currently running on

381
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,779
the computer and they're looking for

382
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:42,029
these type of processes so LMK Bank B

383
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:45,180
client which are RBS from different

384
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,380
things another process I want to bring

385
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,790
your attention to is this one you are

386
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,640
but exe and this is actually a software

387
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,530
provided by the central bank of russia

388
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:59,100
so this one awh cdc and what it does is

389
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,800
it allow banks to transfer money between

390
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,220
them so these groups when they found a

391
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,750
system with this they know that they

392
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,390
have the possibility to attempt a

393
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,970
fraudulent transfer how this works is

394
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,260
that they will queue up several

395
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,960
transaction then sign them then process

396
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,910
them also the processor will try to

397
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,280
change modify the content of these

398
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,280
orders to either change the recipient

399
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,810
account let's say or maybe have a new

400
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,660
one and the last system I want to talk

401
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,570
about is money transfers so they are

402
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,400
also looking for processes like

403
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,190
translink which is a western union

404
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,780
process so i guess most of you is

405
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,430
familiar with western union it allows

406
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,890
you to send to wire money to 12 people

407
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,910
and contact and GHC as well which is a

408
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,080
russian equivalent so they're also

409
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,120
looking for this type of of software

410
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,180
that they can then abuse and try to make

411
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:56,640
money out of so Anton in the beginning

412
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,270
of 2014 together with Robert repo scheme

413
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,720
we made the

414
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,260
he published a blog and it was really

415
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:10,720
first analysis of this malware and as

416
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,740
many sophisticated model today it has

417
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:20,890
model in a heater and I'm gonna describe

418
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,709
this model so first model is called its

419
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,030
main component is responsible for cincy

420
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,950
communication for making screenshot for

421
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,230
injecting other models to write

422
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,980
processes next three models had

423
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,909
dedicated to attack remote banking

424
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:43,900
software like I bank or I fobs wishes

425
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,370
popular in Oakland and then monitor

426
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,460
model that sends information what

427
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,720
[Music]

428
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,940
processes are running on infected

429
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,429
computer and then standard things like

430
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:05,980
keylogger Remote Administrator two

431
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,840
different models in C and Amy and from

432
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,460
grabbing and passive serial for working

433
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,100
but what makes this drawing interesting

434
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,580
is that it's focused on trading software

435
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,120
so Kirko has checks for whether specific

436
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,870
software is installed on the system on

437
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:32,260
injector system so this checks they made

438
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:37,809
locally so we know what we see are they

439
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:40,419
going after as illustrated here in quark

440
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,169
oh is curious about the trading these

441
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:49,860
systems and after we published the blog

442
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,600
Sarah month later we discovered two new

443
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,500
models first model that was called quick

444
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,909
a target cristóbal station is how we

445
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:03,370
describe it itself software package for

446
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,000
providing online access to exchange this

447
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,390
list of supported the exchanges this how

448
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,160
it looks like

449
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,940
Stan that trading thing the second model

450
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,370
that was discussed it it targets

451
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,850
transact application which is kinda

452
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:25,770
similar but coming from different vendor

453
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:32,170
and this how it works like so important

454
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,750
note here that these models are used to

455
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,290
collect information they stole

456
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,600
conventional savings balance they not

457
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,930
used to control software remotely and

458
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,990
let's move to cousin it's a Russian city

459
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:55,600
that located in tatarstan region and it

460
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,350
is where notorious corkle case happened

461
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,810
so Kirko attackers compromised a

462
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,750
computer which used the Australian

463
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,700
criminal in Russian bank and for the

464
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,430
great forensic analysis was made by a

465
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,510
grue baby so this terminal was injected

466
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,660
for at least six months and attack

467
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,720
attack as they learn everything to

468
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,160
perform this attack so before we start

469
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,230
I'm going to explain you how to read

470
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,400
Kendall chopped

471
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,250
so there is two types of candlestick

472
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,860
green which means that raise price moved

473
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,870
up in particular period and red candle

474
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,470
that it which means that which indicates

475
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:59,430
that price moved down and Tara's body

476
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,170
it's all different between opened and

477
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:05,560
closed position and there is a shadow it

478
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,460
shows hai aur woh that price able to

479
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:16,780
achieve in that period so it was friday

480
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,590
afternoon attackers knew that no one is

481
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,040
using infected computer at the moment

482
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,000
because I barata usually had lunch at

483
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,360
the time and attacker started to perform

484
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,890
taking operation on behalf of the bank

485
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,740
the Tigers opened several position for

486
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,310
selling and also for book buying dollars

487
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:45,190
this position they contain significant

488
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,920
significant amount of dollars and robots

489
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:58,440
and the result is is on the slide this

490
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,910
chart is sauce Moscow will change with

491
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,300
time frame one hour financial instrument

492
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:13,120
is US dollar in rubble pair and so bid

493
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:20,050
big red big red line show us that path I

494
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:25,990
was 66 roubles for a dollar and price

495
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:32,920
loss so that it would 55 it was price

496
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,430
low at the time at first view attackers

497
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:40,440
didn't gain any profit from this attack

498
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,410
because but imagine if you are trader

499
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,360
and you know that something like this

500
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,630
will happen in an

501
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:51,740
what you want to do maybe you want by

502
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,160
dollars for 55 rebels and then five

503
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,430
minutes later you want to solve them for

504
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:04,940
66 so it is kind of different kind of

505
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,650
attack so it is not when for example

506
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,720
money are gone because they transferred

507
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,110
on different bank actually money were

508
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:21,440
used to buy and so but but not for fire

509
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,810
price or not for current power rice and

510
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:32,390
also because money were used by bank

511
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,870
lost five minutes dollars in feet less

512
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:40,310
than 15 minutes and another thing I want

513
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:43,360
to say that this reputation was because

514
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,660
some traders don't they don't believe in

515
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:53,840
story with malware and we believe that

516
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,300
it is his known attack of this pain

517
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:08,270
there alright I'm back Oh excellent so

518
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,580
to wrap things up as I said in the very

519
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,340
beginning when we wrote the paper we

520
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,850
were arguing that these regional attacks

521
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,820
were deemed to expand to other part of

522
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,760
the world well actually it kind of made

523
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,970
a big boom and I guess you guys all know

524
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,830
about the difference with compromises

525
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,370
that occurred so this headline back in

526
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,550
April 2015 and this the central bank of

527
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,740
Bangladesh got compromised they were

528
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,080
able to make several transfer by using

529
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,960
Swift most of them were recalled but a

530
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,360
large amount of money was sent with two

531
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,940
to the Philippines more than 18 million

532
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,400
u.s. dollars were were lost basically

533
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,630
which is a huge and a huge amount and

534
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:56,450
shortly after that some people linked a

535
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,550
tool that was used in this

536
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,160
I allegedly use and they linked it to

537
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,390
the Sony hack and we like it's a general

538
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,590
general knowledge i would say that

539
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,650
sunyac was linked to the north korea so

540
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,570
the media took this and then they said

541
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,960
okay North Korea is behind and the

542
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,840
Bangladesh hit then other media reported

543
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,430
that it might be Chinese hackers and

544
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,070
then I also saw that it might be Russian

545
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,930
hackers well I don't know I don't have

546
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,940
the answer for you and I doubt that hand

547
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,890
and has it as well but what I know is

548
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,050
that definitely these type of attacks

549
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,450
against financial institutions the type

550
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,160
of attacks we weren't seeing before are

551
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,510
now commonplace and the last event I

552
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,770
want to talk about is something that

553
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,010
happened last July in Taiwan so a group

554
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,960
of people for two days were getting into

555
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,030
first bank in Taiwan near ATMs and

556
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,400
without interacting with the ATM without

557
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,650
inserting card without touching it they

558
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,320
were able to withdraw more than 2 12

559
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,180
million u.s. dollars in the course of

560
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,190
two days so I don't know if that rings a

561
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,500
bell but this is exactly the same type

562
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,180
of attack that carbonek was doing and

563
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,060
here you see the the suspects that the

564
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,530
police the Taiwanese police were looking

565
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:12,140
for there are Russian nationals Latvian

566
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,450
and Romanian and nationals in there they

567
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,980
were able to catch some of them but most

568
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,950
of them flew away and this just

569
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,410
illustrate the fact that these gangs

570
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,820
that we're doing there's these attacks

571
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,850
in Russia on our targeting old other

572
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,910
like other regions that are likely to

573
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,640
have maybe has some problems in the

574
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,280
security so really to sum it up the key

575
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,530
takeaways reach specialization I think

576
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,730
this is key because you have these

577
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,560
groups that have highly skilled

578
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,890
criminals are able to interact with

579
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,630
software that most of most of us don't

580
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:47,180
know about right and they most of them

581
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,980
are exploiting weaknesses in these

582
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,630
financial systems what that means is

583
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,520
that with the correct security like most

584
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,390
of these attacks could have been

585
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,280
prevented so if you have correct network

586
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,120
separation if you have a better

587
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,770
authentication for the transfer these

588
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,320
are attacks that should be preventable

589
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,630
and finally the expansion already

590
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,290
happening so

591
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,710
for the bed the better part of 2016 we

592
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,260
see these attacks come up now and again

593
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,920
so thank you for your attention and

594
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,830
we're happy to take questions does

595
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:24,230
anybody have any questions like it was

596
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:28,640
very informative no questions thank you

597
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:41,660
very good we have one down here I thanks

598
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,600
it's a quick question I believe have you

599
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,330
seen any developments on the mobile

600
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:51,890
malware side for those you know it's

601
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:55,430
mostly compromising system and styling

602
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:58,250
tools and then mobile no we don't

603
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,490
because there are some mobile banking

604
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,580
Trojans but I haven't seen them yet

605
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,260
attacking the financial institutions

606
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,080
themselves so maybe it's a bit late so

607
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,180
you're totally right that there exists a

608
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,270
lot of mobile children that will either

609
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,760
try to make a transaction when mobile

610
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,860
making will try to steal two-factor

611
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,710
authentication but I don't and then you

612
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,890
know

613
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,790
the specialization that you're talking

614
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,870
of here yes do you have any insight into

615
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:40,150
whether it reflects that some of the

616
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,190
people involved in these crime groups

617
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:45,280
may actually have some experience from

618
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,890
working in the financial institutions

619
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,440
that that targeting or at least ones

620
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,930
that use the same software or is it does

621
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,270
it reflect that they actually just have

622
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,890
that much time on their hands that they

623
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,470
can sit there and remotely monitor and

624
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,720
work out what these systems do and what

625
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,960
they have to do to fraudulently use them

626
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,270
now that they've got control so I

627
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:11,110
believe there's a bit of both so the the

628
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,180
tools we're seeing that are installing a

629
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:16,540
computer allows them to basically spy on

630
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,580
their targets right so they would

631
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,470
certainly be able to learn more about

632
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,810
how they're using it and which software

633
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,360
or they're using in the type of transfer

634
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,950
so of course there's some part of that

635
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,890
now if they have inside information I

636
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,320
don't know like I think this is

637
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,350
definitely a possibility but I have no

638
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:39,070
indication that someone got hit with

639
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:46,540
that no Anton either all right I think

640
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,000
that's because time thank you very much

641
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,480
guys

642
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,920
[Applause]
