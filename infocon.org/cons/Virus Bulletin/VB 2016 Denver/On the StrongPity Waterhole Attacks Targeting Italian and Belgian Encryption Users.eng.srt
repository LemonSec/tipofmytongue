1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:04,110
welcome everyone to the second session

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,600
in this group today we're going to be

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,700
having Kurt Baumgartner come and speak

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,030
to us about on the strong pity watering

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,340
hole attacks everyone please join me in

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:21,480
welcoming Kurt all right good morning

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,769
everyone thanks for attending my talk

8
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:25,529
I'm Kurt Baumgartner I'm a principal

9
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,930
security researcher with Kaspersky Labs

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,420
global research analysis team I've been

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,090
with the company about six years most of

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,880
it looking at targeted attacks and quite

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,350
a bit of other work regarding exploit

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,940
kits and Java exploitation and other

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,059
things but today I want to talk with you

16
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,960
about a watering hole tactic or an apt

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,510
tactic and in particular this one was

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,399
carried out fairly recently over the

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:01:00,800
summer by a publicly undisclosed apt the

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,989
the watering hole attack themselves and

21
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,150
watering hole as a tactic is not

22
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,360
altogether new is not altogether fresh

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,090
but what's interesting about this set of

24
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,909
attacks in particular is that they were

25
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,810
very focused on users of encryption

26
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,890
technologies in particular Italian and

27
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,600
Belgian users were hit the most but

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,159
Turkish and throughout the Middle East

29
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,329
and some in North Africa or hit as well

30
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:37,920
and so i will talk to you about both the

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,470
group and the tactics and sort of what

32
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,470
the problem here is why bother talking

33
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,710
about this in the first place so all in

34
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,360
all i'll be i'll be starting off with

35
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,159
talking about the relevant encryption

36
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,860
tools they were interested in both to

37
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,520
enable their attacks on these users and

38
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,490
and sort of the secondary tools that

39
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,960
they were after once they were on the

40
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,020
system's what they could do with those

41
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,460
technologies and why they were

42
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,290
vulnerable we'll look at previous

43
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,419
watering holes to compare against

44
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,940
probably the most relevant to compare

45
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,860
what strong pity is doing now

46
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,350
is what crouching Yeti or energetic bear

47
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,920
did in 2014 their focus in particular

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,850
was on ICS organizations or critical

49
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,010
infrastructure they use trojan eyes

50
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,370
installers and replaced them on on

51
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,530
various sites will look into those and

52
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,010
make that comparison and then i'll look

53
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,350
at the specifics of the strong pity

54
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,290
attacks that lasted two of the sites

55
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,430
were up for about or compromised or at

56
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,010
least redirecting users to poisoned

57
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,200
installers for around a week to two

58
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,240
weeks and then there's a there's a third

59
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,800
site that is much more recent and over

60
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,510
the weekend it was up in serving malware

61
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,900
so please don't visit the site but that

62
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,300
in particular is truecrypt they're going

63
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,660
after users of full disk encryption and

64
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,090
older tool for it we'll look at the

65
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,830
geo-targeting what ends up happening

66
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,410
with these sort of reckless watering

67
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,450
hole attacks and then we can talk a

68
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,920
little bit about what they're what

69
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,360
they're doing once they get on systems

70
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,940
so the encryption technology you can

71
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,799
really categorize into two things that

72
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,690
strong pity is interested in one set of

73
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,459
tools falls under your really data at

74
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,930
rest so winrar and truecrypt work on on

75
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,370
data at rest so winrar you pack pack and

76
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,320
archive but then you can follow it up

77
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,790
with a a password of virtually unlimited

78
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,330
length and the package can be packed or

79
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,140
is encrypted I should say with AES 256

80
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,030
so effectively you can have an

81
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,660
unbreakable archive for all practical

82
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,810
purposes using winrar as it's available

83
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,519
now truecrypt is a little different it's

84
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,220
interesting because it's it's a killed

85
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,530
project it's available on sourceforge

86
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,480
the developers tell you not to use it

87
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,120
there was a lot of drama around auditing

88
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,738
the package and whether or not people

89
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,978
should be using truecrypt and

90
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:25,140
essentially they offer it now to migrate

91
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,720
data away from truecrypt and onto

92
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,110
say a hardware encryption drive or a

93
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,210
hardware encrypted drive which is

94
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,090
interesting either the defenders are

95
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,120
still using an outdated tool which is

96
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,010
quite possible people are still running

97
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,980
winxp and critical infrastructure but

98
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,380
more likely than not they're looking at

99
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,900
older data that they want to move into a

100
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,750
new environment so that's interesting

101
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,570
too and then the second type of tools or

102
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,370
the second set of tools has to do with

103
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,290
data in motion encrypting data in motion

104
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,290
so whether i am clients like skype or

105
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,680
jabber are being used ssh clients I

106
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,880
believe everybody here knows about

107
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,060
secure shell and what a great tool it is

108
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,850
and then finally moving data and moving

109
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,390
communications with filezilla secure

110
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,100
windows copy client and then and then

111
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:25,160
RDP clients as well the problem with

112
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,990
people depending on tools like this

113
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,120
isn't necessarily the strength of the

114
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,370
encryption but may have more to do with

115
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,350
how they're being distributed this

116
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,450
continues to be a real problem and this

117
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,460
is what strong pity is taking advantage

118
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:46,310
of so a truecrypt itself may be may be

119
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,050
distributed through sourceforge and

120
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,840
several mirrors but there's no way to

121
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,419
really verify that a truecrypt side and

122
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,160
sort of the state of the project may be

123
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,770
deployed somewhere else or distributed

124
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,669
from another another site properly there

125
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:08,130
are PGP keys there are all sorts of md5

126
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,840
but a lot of people just are not are not

127
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,550
as technical as they should be perhaps

128
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,860
the ease of use the ability to identify

129
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,720
whether or not a hash or signatures is

130
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,080
valid some people just are not doing

131
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,930
that very well there are also resellers

132
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,300
and distributors of winrar for example

133
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,990
so what may look like a localized

134
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,000
version of winrar may really be a

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,660
poisoned installer and it's just very

136
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,990
hard to see

137
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,150
to understand where it should be coming

138
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,500
from and how it's how it should be

139
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,450
properly distributed we do have

140
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,490
appropriate places like you know the

141
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,370
google google well the apple store the

142
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,590
microsoft store microsoft update they're

143
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,960
using ssl they're using keys to verify

144
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,120
the packages chrome update verifies

145
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,690
software coming across the wire but in a

146
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,580
lot of cases for open source encryption

147
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,280
packages and winrar and other other

148
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,740
packages it's just not easy it's just

149
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,210
not sort of hassle free to identify

150
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,460
you're getting a valid encryption

151
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,910
technology deploy or distributed to your

152
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:25,060
system so with crouching Yeti again

153
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,580
that's the most relevant watering hole

154
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,920
technique when you're comparing

155
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,350
different actors they poisoned

156
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,570
installers so installers of all sorts

157
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,970
whether it was VPN clients that are

158
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,600
mainly used in critical infrastructure

159
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,190
sort of industrial-strength digital

160
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,160
camera driver installers so energetic

161
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,890
bear would compromise a website or an

162
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,970
FTP site pull down the installer for the

163
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,530
drivers or the software that they're

164
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,200
interested in poison it with a back door

165
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,950
and then put it back on the site for

166
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,830
industrial IT environments or industrial

167
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,320
environment IT staff to download install

168
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,660
within their within their organization

169
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,110
so that was very effective in 2014 and

170
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,000
again strong pity is doing something

171
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,710
very similar this summer so what are we

172
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:22,780
really seeing well in one case it seems

173
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,250
that strong pity couldn't fully

174
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,710
compromise the distributor site they

175
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,840
were able to get a link on the site you

176
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,870
see here a a button there's a there's a

177
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,240
blue button that recommends oh this is

178
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,890
the version you really want to install

179
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,360
it's either x64 x32 or one of several

180
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,970
languages in the background really what

181
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,350
they were doing is they were they had

182
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,080
set up a site called raúl rob and when

183
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,680
you look at rawr rawr lab the legitimate

184
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,140
site and raúl rob it's kind of it's kind

185
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,820
of hard to tell what's going on

186
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,620
and especially with just a simple

187
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,750
redirect from a button that's going to

188
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,550
download to your system something that

189
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,190
looks very much like an appropriate

190
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,020
installer but instead what they had on

191
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,450
this rel rob site was a set of

192
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,900
installers that would that were poisoned

193
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,360
and would drop their back doors in their

194
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,130
spyware to an individual's systems and

195
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,950
again this is very difficult for most

196
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,830
end-users to identify and verify that

197
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,250
this version of winrar is the one that

198
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,710
they're after if you go to the winrar

199
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,860
dot b ii site now you'll see a nice

200
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,590
little section here that gives you keys

201
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,100
and it tells you or hashes i should say

202
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,950
sha-256 that tell you what the package

203
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,510
you're downloading should match up with

204
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,550
or should be fingerprinted with the

205
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,710
problem with that is if the site was

206
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,390
compromised they could very easily

207
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,060
replace the key as well so there isn't

208
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,320
sort of a two-factor verification of

209
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,040
this software package for users of

210
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,860
encryption we saw something very similar

211
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,330
the attackers had compromised winrar dot

212
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:14,830
IT this is a localized distributor of

213
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:20,290
winrar and over https people would end

214
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,470
up downloading from the server itself

215
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,560
these poison packages and they were

216
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,470
localized they were also delivered

217
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,220
appropriately so there were x64 versions

218
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,110
in x32 versions being delivered to the

219
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,600
end user system appropriately since then

220
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,610
these guys have cleaned up the site and

221
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,300
strong pity is not being delivered but

222
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,400
again when you look at the site and

223
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,170
download this stuff it's very difficult

224
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,350
to verify for sort of a typical end user

225
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,370
to verify whether or not the encryption

226
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,820
technology they're downloading is the

227
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,450
appropriate one

228
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,690
at the same time these guys were

229
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,660
interested in truecrypt now the

230
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,670
interesting thing it about when you

231
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,680
about putting winrar and truecrypt

232
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,529
together is that if you're encrypting

233
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:18,480
with winrar and you're encrypting with

234
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,459
truecrypt and you're using say a file

235
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,380
sharing site you can have a virtual

236
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:29,300
end-to-end encrypted fully encrypted

237
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,089
solution on the right here on your left

238
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:35,820
there you can see truecrypt sourceforge

239
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,800
net this is the legitimate source of the

240
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,570
truecrypt package at this point and this

241
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,830
is true crypt true crypt com is what

242
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,240
strong pity set up and again please

243
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,240
don't visit that site what you'd have to

244
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,779
do is there's a very long list of

245
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,720
instructions and warnings about not

246
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,520
using the package and then at the very

247
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,420
bottom there's a link to to a strong

248
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,720
pity malware package that does install

249
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,970
truecrypt the software package and then

250
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,820
alongside you get a little treat you get

251
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,880
the backdoor dropper and it can install

252
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,959
key loggers and and some other spyware

253
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,930
along with it um but again this is very

254
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,100
difficult for sort of the average user

255
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,560
who's interested in privacy and securing

256
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,720
their data to really differentiate

257
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,140
between the two so really what did the

258
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,570
guy what did strong pity hit over the

259
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,020
summer well over here you can see from

260
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,930
the Belgian site the redirects to ral

261
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,470
Rob calm hit mostly all belgium belgian

262
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,550
users in this case they hit almost a

263
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,709
hundred users that we have visibility

264
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,620
into so that means to that means to me

265
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,180
that we're seeing the tip of the iceberg

266
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,550
and this is clearly more than just a

267
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,250
hundred users that are getting hit also

268
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,149
interesting is that northern African

269
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:10,440
visitors we're getting hit with the same

270
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,370
malware along with Dutch and so on on

271
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:18,090
the on the winrar dot IT

272
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,280
mostly all Italian users which tells me

273
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,140
this watering hole was a very sloppy

274
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,490
attack and from there you'll also see

275
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,560
Belgian and Algerian users we're getting

276
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,710
hit as well and then finally with the

277
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,110
truecrypt site you see almost all of the

278
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,850
users getting hit are localized the

279
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,980
attacks really are in in Turkey the

280
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,940
method they were using to push users to

281
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,800
the true dash crypt comm site was to

282
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,050
place links and place redirects on to

283
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,480
other sites within turkey itself so

284
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,280
software aggregation sites that are a

285
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,240
collection of freeware and shareware and

286
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,870
other things they basically replace the

287
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,670
links on that site and redirected people

288
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,250
to true true to their true crypt com

289
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,790
site so again a very sloppy method of

290
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,390
targeting a select set of individuals

291
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,490
you're after and all in all this group

292
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,710
they've deployed zero day in the past so

293
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,780
they're technically very capable they've

294
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,120
effectively spear fished entire

295
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,990
organizations and groups and so they can

296
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,450
be very precise with what they do but

297
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,570
apparently that wasn't working so they

298
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,420
shifted their tactics to a very sloppy

299
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:53,620
method which is this water holing so

300
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,900
once they're on a system some of the

301
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,940
additional components strong pity

302
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,380
components that they download to a

303
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,230
system are interested in these other

304
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,910
encryption tools so it's not just when

305
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,770
we aren't truecrypt they're interested

306
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,980
in SH clients that are secure shell

307
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,860
clients that specifically run on Windows

308
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,470
systems they know exactly what they're

309
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,440
after here they're dealing with IM

310
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,660
clients that maintain strong encryption

311
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,240
so there have they download key loggers

312
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,450
and multiple components specifically

313
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,730
crafted to steal contacts and

314
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,080
communications from these as well so

315
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,660
the focus specifically is on the fact

316
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,830
that these widely available easy to

317
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,740
install two encryption technologies are

318
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,500
being used by their targets and they

319
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,060
can't clearly they can't access the data

320
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,970
once it's encrypted with these solutions

321
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,040
so I don't know if you'd call this a

322
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,510
side channel attack or simply system

323
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,930
compromised but the unusual in this the

324
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,090
sort of extraordinary focus of these

325
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,810
guys is clearly on on users of

326
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:11,990
encryption technologies all right and

327
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,260
and with that I just like to open up to

328
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,830
some questions thank you for your time

329
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:22,460
thank you if you have a question please

330
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,710
raise your hand and one of our runners

331
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:31,150
will bring the microphone to you here

332
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,890
thanks that last slide you showed a

333
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,620
bunch of different tools can you say a

334
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,970
little more about what it is that you

335
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,410
observed them doing with those tools I

336
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,210
thought you said they were installing

337
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,290
those tools are you saying they're

338
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,270
installing compromised versions of those

339
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,180
tools so they can so the okay good

340
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,240
question so can i clarify on really what

341
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,570
they're using to as an attack vector and

342
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,520
what they're collecting data from so

343
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,000
this last this last slide is what

344
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,560
they're interested in collecting data

345
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,380
from they weren't using these as an

346
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,980
attack vector so winrar those the

347
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,900
watering hole sites related to

348
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,839
localization in distributor sites those

349
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,390
were being used as an attack vector

350
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,819
truecrypt was being used as an attack

351
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,560
vector I'm going to guess they're after

352
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,300
the data being hidden by that stuff as

353
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,250
well but that's the attack vector and

354
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,650
then multiple components that were

355
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,650
downloaded two systems later on were

356
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,080
hard coded and specifically looking to

357
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,160
steal data from from these sorts of

358
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,060
tools so clearly they're wrestling with

359
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,880
the encryption problem so oh so this is

360
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,070
my last point so why even talk about

361
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,640
this

362
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,810
well clearly with these tools or with i

363
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,990
should say winrar i should i should say

364
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,240
these tools are very effective

365
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,190
encryption technologies if one was to

366
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,320
access p caps of the data flowing across

367
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,920
these you know communications it's going

368
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,120
the work is going nowhere but what

369
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,280
they're doing is they're going after the

370
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,230
long the low-hanging fruit and right now

371
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,320
the low-hanging fruit is verification

372
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,850
and true validation of installation and

373
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,450
I'd any identity of these encryption

374
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,700
packages and in particular winrar and

375
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,380
truecrypt is what they were using and

376
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,810
that sort of distribution system yeah so

377
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,180
just to make sure I get it taste these

378
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,860
are all interesting tools and I can

379
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,060
understand why the attacker would be

380
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,170
interested in what you're doing with

381
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,990
them are you saying they they're

382
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,900
installing malware that lets them

383
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,360
observe data that's that's manipulated

384
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,800
by these applications that's being

385
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,170
encrypted with these okay but they're

386
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,760
bringing malware that lets them get

387
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,320
visibility before the encryption happens

388
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,720
yes targets these okay yeah okay thank

389
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,620
you any other questions

390
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:13,429
bueller bueller well not see any other

391
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:15,530
questions I guess we'll wrap up a little

392
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,670
early everyone please join me in

393
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,360
thanking Kurt for his presentation

394
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,879
[Applause]
