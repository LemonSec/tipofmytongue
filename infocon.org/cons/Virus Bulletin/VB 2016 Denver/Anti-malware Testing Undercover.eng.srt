1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,580
welcome everybody we'll get this next

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,060
session here started our first speakers

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,220
will be records of wine in Berg and

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,050
Louis currents they're going to be

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,120
speaking about the anti-malware testing

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,089
undercover if you would uh please join

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,740
me in welcoming to the stage yeah thank

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,539
you for joining us oh we were still

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,039
having a good conversation there

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,500
hi welcome and email were testing

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,869
undercover code presentation the reefs

12
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,040
of currents of Panda and me from ESET

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,200
testing is always an interesting thing

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,540
it is controversial people think it's

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,370
controversial and it will always be

16
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,219
controversial and we have seen like real

17
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,200
testing is also really difficult if you

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,579
want to do with like real-world

19
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,370
components if you saw Simon ethicist

20
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,860
presentation earlier yesterday the

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,149
things he has to do to make it like a

22
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,160
real-world test it's right it's getting

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,160
rather complex and contrary to what

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,489
people believe it is highly complex

25
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,680
people think it is easy it is not that

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,290
easy there are real challenges we have

27
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,720
to face day to day to make it really

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,049
good but the technical the technical

29
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,840
details testers have to endure to do

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,909
proper testing that has been presented

31
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,220
many many times here at VB and we

32
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,420
decided not to do that

33
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,119
the reason I actually came up to look to

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,119
the problem using a different approach

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,979
how things are influenced because dust

36
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,340
just testing influence things definitely

37
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,520
it does so Louisville in a minute start

38
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,890
with a short introduction on this and we

39
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,990
are going to do to look at how tests

40
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,540
influence on tomorrow development now if

41
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,150
you think this is going to be a battle

42
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,790
to smash like testers no we're going to

43
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,100
do it in a nice way and objectively as

44
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,479
well because we also going to look how

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,189
anti-malware fenders trying to influence

46
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:52,520
test

47
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,390
thank you rigor then we will talk about

48
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,950
one of my favorite topics cheating and

49
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:06,689
will will talk about some examples some

50
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,610
sometimes there are there is clear

51
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,679
cheating sometimes it's there is kind of

52
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,930
a gray area in between so we will

53
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,830
discuss those

54
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,950
and finally the complexion so let's

55
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,870
let's go to the to the interaction

56
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,760
testing has been covered fires bullet in

57
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,210
here many times but we we felt somehow

58
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,540
that there was something missing we

59
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,390
didn't have like the whole picture of

60
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,030
the testing so that's why we came up

61
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,020
with this this presentation

62
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,410
testing matters a lot as we were saying

63
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,900
it influences and and not just

64
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,930
insecurity but you know kind of themes

65
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,700
and of course my dear my friends in the

66
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,510
first time are laughing now but yet yeah

67
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,070
of course you all know what happened

68
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,740
when you go to a test to obtain a

69
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,320
certification and then you cheat and

70
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,510
then someone finds out but there is more

71
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,760
to the story this was probably exactly

72
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,650
to like one month ago in Reuters and

73
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,180
what it was most interesting was what

74
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,280
you can read there tougher standards and

75
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,510
testing methods will increased

76
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,830
technology occurs to the point where

77
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,890
diesel is first out of the marker out of

78
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:31,650
the market so yes testing influences a

79
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:37,230
lot it does Luis and how do tests

80
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,480
influence Ultima development because it

81
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,930
is from one end always influencing the

82
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,760
development of anti-malware products and

83
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,510
is that desirable sometimes if it is

84
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,760
really improving security and the

85
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,470
protection for the end user but it's not

86
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,690
always that case the earth actually some

87
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,360
cases that when anti-malware development

88
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,850
is influenced by a test it is just to be

89
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,830
better in a test which is not helping

90
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,760
the end user we're actually going to

91
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,890
describe various scenarios where this

92
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,260
has happened where fenders were

93
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,239
quote-unquote force because it's not

94
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,760
like they're physically beating us

95
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,870
they'll try to do that with me by the

96
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,108
way to develop certain characteristics

97
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:21,750
in the product actually not to have a

98
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,789
better product from a security point of

99
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:25,080
view but just to have a better product

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,040
in testing

101
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,710
there's no problem for a test to

102
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,660
influence the anti-malware development

103
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,060
if it really is finding a loophole a

104
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,100
security issue and actually makes the

105
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,410
product better but of course it it's not

106
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,330
really helping if it is just to be

107
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,860
better in a test and not helping the

108
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:48,190
end-user so on the man test another of

109
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,700
my favorite topics so believe it or not

110
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,100
they are still happening I mean this

111
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,590
will have stopped like 20 years ago but

112
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,650
still we see almost every day or at

113
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,980
least every month new on the man test it

114
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,630
is true that most of the times they are

115
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,100
just part of a number of different tests

116
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,120
but they are really useless in most of

117
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,700
the cases I do agree that for some

118
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,880
reasons it could be explainable that on

119
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,760
the man test has to be done but to be

120
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,580
honest well I what I feel is like if

121
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,110
this was about beer

122
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:31,870
so an on-demand test is like Bud Light -

123
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:37,000
- beer I mean yeah it's testing but it's

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,920
pretty useless at least with the Bud

125
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,870
Light do I've been told that you can get

126
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:46,750
drunk I couldn't - but really so you may

127
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,550
think that I'm hating on the man test

128
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,060
and yeah you probably are right why is

129
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,360
that you cannot imagine the massive

130
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,840
waste of resources during many many

131
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,630
years in all anti-malware labs

132
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,210
I mean hundreds of malware analysts

133
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:09,880
Brighton signatures yes to have decent

134
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,700
results in on-demand tests and that's

135
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,760
the only reason you would say no but you

136
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,380
need to add signatures to your solution

137
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,990
so you can protect your customers

138
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,610
 I mean sometimes you need to do

139
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,220
that but many times it's not like that I

140
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,560
mean like no it's not only malware that

141
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,020
is not in the while anymore but we're

142
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,460
talking about malware that if he tries

143
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,660
to get to the computer you have like

144
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,240
many different technologies that will

145
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,100
block that and that work that will never

146
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,650
happen but still we have to waste time

147
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,940
or in signal to store that

148
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,350
so that's how I feel about animal

149
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,560
testing and how it influences us in this

150
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,750
case not that much in the development

151
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,970
itself but yes on the daily work we have

152
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:57,040
to do in the labs good so another type

153
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,090
of testing that has done this

154
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,200
performance testing and well this is my

155
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,510
24th Phoebe and I'm almost 30 year in

156
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,310
the industry and yes I know in the real

157
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,340
beginning the performance overhead was

158
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,970
like sometimes historical like they're

159
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,430
known cases where a product slows the

160
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,260
system down to be a brick the brick

161
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,160
would be faster but now everything

162
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,540
actually at that time even performance

163
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,669
testing was done with Justin on the mum

164
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:26,710
test well that of course all got much

165
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,330
better everything is done now with

166
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,300
real-world components which is much

167
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,040
better because it gives you really you

168
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,870
can measure the overhead of a system how

169
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:40,060
much it will slow down and performance

170
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,460
is actually really important because it

171
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,380
actually is influencing like test

172
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,910
results the readers will read it that

173
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,280
it's affecting the users and it so

174
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,580
actually may also like demote you like

175
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,070
in a test may actually cost you some

176
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,440
sales which is not the right thing of

177
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,180
course we won't we all want to sell more

178
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,570
and more so for that particular reason

179
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,340
the money flow grass actually growing

180
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,880
trends for products to improve their

181
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,860
performance there's nothing wrong with

182
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,780
improving performances if it benefits

183
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,000
the end user but in those cases actually

184
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,979
just to improve performance in a

185
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:18,639
specific test is that is that referral

186
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,690
not really how can you do that because

187
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,470
sometimes we see fenders optimizing

188
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,250
specific performance tests only to be

189
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,830
better in a test but they are actually

190
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,169
opening opening up a security hole in

191
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:38,020
the system so what we should do is

192
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,450
actually to have an efficacy test do the

193
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,429
performance test but also try to see if

194
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,440
it still was protecting you do the same

195
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,380
test but with relevant mower samples to

196
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,420
see if it is detected and then yeah then

197
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,270
the performance increase is like okay

198
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,310
but not if it's only

199
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,470
to improve in the test and not improving

200
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,420
the security or actually minimizing

201
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,890
security so real-world test those are

202
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,380
the tests I like so if on a mantis was

203
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,650
bad light a real-world test looks like

204
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,310
that

205
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:14,470
Francisca never my favorite beer so why

206
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,240
do I think we serve them the most

207
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,950
relevant and most one of the most

208
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,339
important kind of tests because here the

209
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:23,470
testers are trying to mimic what it is

210
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,460
really happening in the world so they're

211
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,910
do you're measuring the the the right

212
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,980
thing I mean it's they are doing what

213
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,710
the users are doing and the better thing

214
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,290
is that usually will as benders we

215
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,560
always want to be on the top so our one

216
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,440
of our problems with testing like in the

217
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,940
on-demand testing I was saying earlier

218
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,060
is that if we have to devote resources

219
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:54,430
to to get a better result in a test but

220
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,700
that goes against protecting protecting

221
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,220
better our customers which usually

222
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,770
happens that's that's a huge problem but

223
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,150
with the real-world test if it is

224
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,420
performed properly that means that to

225
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,580
have a good Bruce shoulder what you have

226
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,300
to do is to protect your customers and

227
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,160
the better you do it the best result you

228
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,630
will have however that's in the ideal

229
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,570
world because it doesn't happen always

230
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,780
so we had a case I won't name the tester

231
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,790
but actually don't remember which tester

232
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,960
it was but I remember the a big company

233
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,780
because it was panda so in one of these

234
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,760
real-world tests once we have problems

235
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,810
detecting a few cases and they still

236
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,700
have been detected so so we took a look

237
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,240
at all the information we have and we

238
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,270
found out okay - to do this real-world

239
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,089
test you need to do a lot of work as a

240
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:58,270
tester so testers either used

241
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,550
third-party tools or use their own tools

242
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,350
which is fine but in this case the use

243
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,710
of the tools implied that the

244
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,470
behavior it was similar but not exactly

245
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,089
the same as it happens in the real world

246
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,760
so and that's why in our case we were

247
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,450
not blocking a few few threats we I

248
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,060
remember we we talked to that tester and

249
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,560
they said they didn't change anything

250
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,870
but we could actually see that they they

251
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,880
were doing it differently actually it

252
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,320
was the way it was no load in the

253
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,640
samples into the computer it was

254
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,200
different so we have to create a smoke

255
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,810
we have to modify our solution to take

256
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,080
into account that use case which has

257
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,300
never happened in the real world and it

258
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,310
has never happened again in that tester

259
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:48,660
because in the next test it all came to

260
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:56,160
normal yeah so we talked about the

261
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,230
real-world components already and on the

262
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,850
amount test but then we also have the

263
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,649
default configuration the show called

264
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:04,680
out-of-the-box configuration of course

265
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,180
you want to compare apples and apples

266
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,430
and not apples and oranges so testers

267
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,870
can only use out-of-the-box

268
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,330
configurations because that is what the

269
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,339
the anti-malware vendors actually

270
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,100
suggesting for their users to be used to

271
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,140
be have the best protection well right

272
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,440
now we already have seen a few known

273
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,870
products that are actually out of the

274
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,930
box performing better in tests but not

275
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,060
in real life and were they actually

276
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,180
giving their users hints and tips on how

277
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,700
to enable certain settings to get a

278
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,360
better result and a better protection

279
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,700
but that would actually result in like

280
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,480
less performance or a less it detection

281
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,270
in the tests which is interesting to see

282
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,730
because you you really want to compare

283
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,440
it but the default configuration the

284
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,700
out-of-the-box testing which is

285
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,610
basically the only thing antivirus

286
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,820
testers can do is right now not apples

287
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,620
to apples any more splendid axiom these

288
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,010
are difficult to perform obtaining will

289
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,700
worse plight

290
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,190
make them work and then there's the

291
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,400
different solutions against that there

292
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,760
is a but light approach to this which

293
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,850
will be using Metasploit which is not

294
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,070
bad and I think Simon yesterday made a

295
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,710
good example of that I mean how using

296
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,630
Metasploit could be really valid and it

297
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:33,040
makes sense in some cases but what I

298
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,400
think it should be avoid is to only

299
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,490
basis ploy detection on like before

300
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,480
Metasploit use even though it's valid I

301
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,720
mean having detections to block those

302
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,290
flows is kind of really done it's easy

303
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,640
and it doesn't prove anything

304
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,710
I mean you can get it like really as a

305
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,510
vendor it is great for us I mean it does

306
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,450
just want to do that go ahead it's easy

307
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:03,190
to block those those exploits but it

308
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,840
doesn't mean that you are protecting a

309
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,450
guy against real threats that users have

310
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,220
have to face in real world scenarios

311
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,450
yeah and then finding box testers find

312
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,870
box and sometimes they are not even like

313
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,160
that important for the real world a

314
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,510
group that appears when you have like a

315
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,790
million infected samples on your hard

316
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,040
disk yeah it happens a bit less a bit

317
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,510
that's not a problem it's not something

318
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,240
that would be encountered in real life

319
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,380
but sometimes they actually do find

320
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,450
other books as well so it does influence

321
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,640
the anti-malware development but in a

322
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,050
good way because then we can fix the

323
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,500
product and if I go back in time I used

324
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,790
to work for a company called Thunder

325
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,890
bite and was at that time the editor of

326
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,570
Virus Bulletin extra Gerald who was

327
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,380
testing us and every time we miss three

328
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,680
or four or five samples of smack

329
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,110
polymorphic virus at that time and

330
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,370
whatever we did when we received the

331
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,810
sample of course a replicant of that

332
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,310
sample we detected it and we couldn't

333
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,950
figure it out and it took me once a

334
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,990
whole weekend to generate between three

335
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,420
and five million smack samples scanning

336
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,190
them deleting them when we detected them

337
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,960
and at the end of the weekend I found

338
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,660
free samples which we didn't detect and

339
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,760
it was a simple case of a jump below

340
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,640
which would be your jump below or equal

341
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,860
but it took me quite a while to figure

342
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,870
that out and in that is one example

343
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,850
where actually finding box where a

344
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,500
tester influenced the country my own

345
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,970
team our development because I really

346
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,160
had to look into it and putting some

347
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,900
resource in it but it actually helped

348
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,400
improving the security as well for the

349
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,230
end-user so going on with this I think a

350
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,200
very good example of finding backs is a

351
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,600
malformed email project security

352
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,080
researcher and anti-malware testing

353
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,460
organization may the figures ago they

354
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,110
even published study here at bars

355
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,400
bulletin

356
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,940
so they basically they find a way that

357
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,480
could be abused by cyber criminals to

358
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,710
embed malware in email and so email

359
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,200
scanners couldn't detect it because it

360
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,210
was more formal so basically what they

361
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,270
did back at that time was okay that's

362
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,660
how the anti-malware solutions were

363
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,770
responding to that at the moment then

364
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,860
let them know and give them a few months

365
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,920
to fix that test them again after those

366
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,210
few months is this a good or a bad thing

367
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,150
I think it's a good thing however there

368
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,950
are always two sides in every story

369
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,570
because you can say no I mean that's

370
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,820
clearly if if the bad guys will have

371
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,100
found out that that problem before they

372
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,200
could have abused it so thanks to this

373
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,440
we fix it and it's true it's also true

374
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:54,220
that we all benders in in the world

375
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,670
actually almost all back then we had to

376
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,190
to change our priorities in the

377
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,840
development cycles that we already had

378
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,810
in place so who knows if we were

379
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,160
delaying something that was even more

380
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,140
important than that but the there is

381
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,800
always two sides in every story as they

382
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,640
were saying yeah so we have been looking

383
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,300
at how anti-malware testers influence on

384
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,670
the development but we have to look at

385
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,020
the other way around as well like I said

386
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,400
we have we taking this different

387
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,560
approach so how do anti-malware vendors

388
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,160
so I try to influence test if you ask

389
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,920
yourself do they well yeah they try and

390
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,320
for this we actually

391
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,769
asked a few of the testers for some

392
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:40,409
inputs like what they X what I encounter

393
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:42,330
we will go over that in a minute

394
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,120
of course it's not really good if you as

395
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,740
an anti-malware vendor try to influence

396
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:52,769
the test just to get better results it's

397
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:57,029
not so certifications so we're not

398
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:58,740
talking about to compare competitive

399
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,470
testing but your certification so

400
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,019
imagine this scenario a vendor for some

401
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:07,049
reason I don't know to sell their

402
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:09,720
product to access virustotal whatever

403
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,590
needs a certification from a tester this

404
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,629
so this bender goes to the tester and

405
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:19,500
said okay please I I want you to test my

406
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,269
product and because I want to have this

407
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:24,750
certification and then the tester does

408
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,440
his yeah and somehow the product sat and

409
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,070
they didn't earn the certification but

410
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,240
the bender really wants that

411
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,879
certification so says okay I really need

412
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:38,909
that so I will give you I am willing to

413
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:43,049
pay a lot of money to get it the tester

414
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:46,620
refuses it and then the vendor goes to

415
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,720
another tester in a few weeks he has a

416
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,519
brand new certification so this is a

417
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:57,360
hypothetical situation or I wish it was

418
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,669
because it is not and it has happened a

419
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:02,700
number of times that I know so this is

420
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,769
happening basically is kind of buying

421
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,299
the certification they need to get it

422
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:11,570
and and it is happening

423
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:21,100
yeah yeah ask them yeah so collections

424
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,060
of course any tests needs collections

425
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,130
otherwise you cannot test against

426
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,740
samples which are in there and those are

427
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,350
built by the tested themselves

428
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,150
interestingly enough of course having

429
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,830
access to the collection would be a key

430
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,580
item for like route detections and there

431
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,580
are cases known of like vendors trying

432
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,390
to ask a tester if they could sell the

433
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,760
test the test set before the test so

434
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,410
they would have a good result when the

435
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,200
real test is done well that's not the

436
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,100
right way to do it of course obviously

437
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,750
you will have a good result but there

438
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,200
it's not completely ethical and there

439
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,000
are actually all kinds of variants to

440
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,610
that and we like I mentioned we have AHS

441
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,160
testers for some input and well one of

442
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,520
the testers at that moment actually said

443
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,740
can you run a test in which we provide

444
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,350
all the samples and you see how our

445
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,250
product compares against the competition

446
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,850
Thank You Simon

447
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,270
you have noticed actually that Ruby

448
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,830
shall I mentioned Simon a few times he

449
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,300
promised us like bonus points in the

450
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,740
next test so of course that's a joke

451
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,090
it's but the next two tests but there

452
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:41,440
are the five variations to this like

453
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,350
clay use can you do a test for instance

454
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,940
with like Simon just said with the

455
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,010
samples provided by a tester yeah of

456
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,630
course that that vendor will have like

457
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,520
really good results that's not a good

458
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,220
way and there were actually other

459
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,870
interesting things and I have to read

460
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,370
them here because then I can quote them

461
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,310
properly and that happened while we were

462
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:04,330
writing actually the paper if you test

463
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,070
us or publish the results you have

464
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,520
already obtained we will see you so that

465
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,160
actually happens that fenders try to

466
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,450
threaten with a lawsuit against the

467
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,060
tester or hey you testers privately and

468
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,830
if the result is good can you then make

469
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,670
it public it's trying to influence tests

470
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,890
testers or if you do not change the

471
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,809
results to be made more favorable

472
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:27,700
we will sue you which is of course a

473
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,519
really bad thing if offenders really

474
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:34,450
start to like do this to testers like

475
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,820
yeah I mean if you are not agreeing with

476
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,409
the test result and if it's a true

477
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:40,929
result ya live with it but to start to

478
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:43,299
fret them with lawsuits that is not

479
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:47,919
going to help the end user why would

480
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,479
people do this I don't know but it is

481
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:53,499
influencing tests and you would almost

482
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:55,349
think that those who were cheating

483
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:57,999
cheating al Lewis said it's one of his

484
00:21:57,999 --> 00:21:59,529
favorite topics as well so it's a

485
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:01,690
favorite topic of mine we all want to

486
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,989
have the best results in tests and well

487
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:07,330
some products will actually cheat to be

488
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,570
like the better one or the best one

489
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:13,779
which is not a real life scenario well

490
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:16,419
we try we'll try to describe that yeah

491
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,669
it happens I mean they're some cheats

492
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:20,979
that are pretty clear not like and we

493
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:23,909
have known them for for many years like

494
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,549
after your scan in a folder with malware

495
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:30,820
and after a number of hits you start

496
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,229
saying that everything is malware so you

497
00:22:32,229 --> 00:22:34,419
obtain a hundred percent result in that

498
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,849
crappy on-demand test which that has

499
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:43,179
happened qe 18 specific special persons

500
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:46,899
of gurus anti-malware solution to to

501
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:50,679
send to the test when the test protocol

502
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:52,539
specifically says that it has to be a

503
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,999
public person so that for me for example

504
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:59,679
that's enough clear tedium there are

505
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,629
some other more creative cheating things

506
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:08,440
like detecting malware based on the file

507
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,149
name because some testers name the files

508
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:15,789
I don't know with the hashes for example

509
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:19,299
the md5 hash or whatever so there are

510
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:22,929
some vendors that decide to detect based

511
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:25,929
on how the file name is actually I mean

512
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:27,729
if you change the name of the file it

513
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:33,909
won't be detected anymore I have seen

514
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:37,869
things like disabling normal detection

515
00:23:37,869 --> 00:23:39,100
to increase the speed

516
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,910
during performance tests sometimes there

517
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,410
are gray areas where you don't know if

518
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,210
it is cheating or not I remember we were

519
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,370
doing some tests inside pana with

520
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,730
different competitors and there was so

521
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,590
we were measuring the performance there

522
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,799
and one of them was really quick I mean

523
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,650
we were like copying files from the

524
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,010
network to the computer and it was as

525
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:07,299
having no antivirus and actually then we

526
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:09,490
put some malware and actually they were

527
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,230
not detecting anything so they were not

528
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:11,740
scanning

529
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,460
funny enough if you put the acre file

530
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,710
there that was the only file in the

531
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,169
entire world that they would detect so

532
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:24,520
is that sitting I don't know I mean it's

533
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,250
up to the vendor to decide which is the

534
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,760
reason they want to take and and also

535
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,130
they have to do it like a quick

536
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,020
antiperspirant so people doesn't

537
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,480
complain doesn't turn it off but well

538
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,659
those are gray areas and there are

539
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:42,400
similar cases like when you are on the

540
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,380
same hard drive copying one file from

541
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,120
one place to the other they want to scan

542
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,520
it or on the same computer a number of

543
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,840
gray areas that could be or not

544
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,500
considered cheating

545
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,250
so cheating is brown I hope that's clear

546
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,940
let's say it all out loud

547
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,190
good very good so and when we actually

548
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:12,700
start to look well cheating let's look

549
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,780
at a test or an offender site and then

550
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,640
look for instance again I already

551
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,520
mentioned the performance test you want

552
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,810
to do performances in a real-life

553
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:26,350
scenario and people use their systems

554
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,910
the whole day and of course everything

555
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,640
is now measured using real real time

556
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,960
components but then to do a performance

557
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,030
test while installing a predicted

558
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,640
productivity suite it doesn't really

559
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,710
make that much more set make that sense

560
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,420
like hundreds or thousands or hundreds

561
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,100
of thousands of files being copied and

562
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,800
being installed if you ever try to

563
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,230
install office or OpenOffice or any

564
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:54,490
large product it takes minutes does it

565
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,670
really matter if it takes 20 seconds

566
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,380
more when it already took 8 minutes to

567
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,660
install the whole product no and it's

568
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,010
also not something that people are doing

569
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,810
on a day-to-day basis at least I am NOT

570
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,180
installing office every year every day

571
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:13,800
and it's also interesting to see that

572
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,790
right the reaction of some vendors so

573
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,190
some vendors actually their reaction to

574
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:25,990
tests is the dating or the creating

575
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,790
their performance only to be better in

576
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,400
tests that's kind of cheating when they

577
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,170
see an installer being executed they

578
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,720
stop scanning when they know a specific

579
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,060
action is taking place which is done by

580
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,090
a tester they stop scanning so when you

581
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,740
look at the overhead it is hardly there

582
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:49,270
much better result sample selection has

583
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:55,930
been always been a challenge if and this

584
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:59,230
has happened and it it is actually

585
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:02,380
happening what if a distr is using

586
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,860
samples that are never seen anywhere

587
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,410
else in the world

588
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,410
never

589
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,610
but you call that Chilean probably what

590
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:18,190
the tester is doing is just modifying

591
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,350
those samples that could be one of the

592
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:24,790
options to see to see how good antivirus

593
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,510
are detecting if you modify the binaries

594
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:31,080
maybe someone a third party is poisoning

595
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:37,990
the their sample selection another kind

596
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,350
of cheating could be how do you decide

597
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,970
if something is malicious I mean if you

598
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,070
are using antivirus engines and the

599
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,010
malware engines to see if they say it is

600
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:50,740
malicious or not to make your sample

601
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,750
selection for the test that is really

602
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,750
biased then buy boots AIDS is only

603
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,150
almost cheating even if you don't want

604
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:03,850
to to benefit any specific vendor if you

605
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,090
take samples from vendors those vendors

606
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:09,220
school boys on those samples are cool

607
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,040
add I don't know or false positives for

608
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,560
other vendors and some of the other

609
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,310
things we're running out of time so yeah

610
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:21,700
let's go let's go quickly to the choice

611
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,700
yeah

612
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,350
sometimes you see like it's all tests

613
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,940
are all about the winner and the loser

614
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,210
right but we have seen cases where like

615
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,400
in a test publication there was a winner

616
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,930
and a loser and in another magazine

617
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,780
suddenly it was the same test set and

618
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,030
the same tester the results were exactly

619
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,890
the opposite the loser was the winner he

620
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,260
was the editor's choice well there are

621
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,120
some financial incentive there because

622
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,710
when you read through the magazine they

623
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,900
had through three full-page ads in that

624
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,390
magazine which is of course influencing

625
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,850
in this case the editor the problem of

626
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,500
course is that is this cheating yeah

627
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,170
because they are the press people buy a

628
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,240
magazine to to make up their judgments

629
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,980
what to buy and they believe that the

630
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,690
editor or that or the test magazine

631
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,750
actually is writing the truth but in

632
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,100
this case it was just a financial

633
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,230
incentive to make this product the

634
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,380
editor's choice

635
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,300
so finally the final topic about

636
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,380
cheating cloud I was telling Rieger I

637
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,300
have to talk about the cloud as you know

638
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,170
I'm from Panama

639
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,550
have you seen the cloud like for many

640
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,150
many years and really has the adoption

641
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,800
of the cloud has really blurred the line

642
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,920
between what is and what is not cheating

643
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:38,260
and I'm afraid that many testers are not

644
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,050
aware of what kind of information

645
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:45,190
vendors do obtain and it's like crazy

646
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,230
one thing I wanted to brought in the

647
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,660
paper and it wasn't hello because we're

648
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:53,770
so politically correct like so I send a

649
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,840
malware solution you have to be deep

650
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,310
inside the operating system you are

651
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,800
controlling everything so by comparison

652
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,700
it's like a trillion horse on asteroids

653
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,020
that's it I mean we have all the

654
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,960
information so at a certain point like

655
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,990
for the most biggest testers the most

656
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,150
reputable ones they are doing like every

657
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,620
month average amounts their tests and

658
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,190
they first do the whatever real-world

659
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,890
and false positives you know and you can

660
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,630
know when are they doing that and you

661
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,030
can know it in real time and you can

662
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:29,140
even modify the results in real time if

663
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,110
you want it so it's it could be possible

664
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,170
so at the end of the day it's cheating

665
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,490
is becoming something that depends on

666
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,640
the good faith of the vendor which it's

667
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,740
something I wouldn't trust put my trust

668
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:50,350
there to be honest so these are the

669
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,470
Bender's that are watching the testers

670
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:56,580
and us face is really scary

671
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:02,410
so so okay we're running out of time we

672
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:05,380
love these topics as you know we both

673
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,100
are involved in AMT so we are going to

674
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,110
have a meeting in Malaga in a few weeks

675
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,960
where we will be discussing this kind of

676
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,440
stuff among many others if you want to

677
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,640

678
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,710

679
